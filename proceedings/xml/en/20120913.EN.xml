      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Gerald Häfner, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament and the Council concerning the forwarding to and handling by the European Parliament of classified information held by the Council on matters other than those in the area of the common foreign and security policy (2012/2069(ACI)) (A7-0245/2012).</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we can take a crucial step in the direction of more democracy in Europe, as democracy is based on the idea that politics should not take place behind closed doors or in back rooms, but instead that that which is discussed and decided in politics must be transparent, accessible to the public, that the citizens and their elected representatives can follow what happens, that they can legitimate and monitor the decisions taken in politics.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is something that the citizens expect of us as Parliament, very specifically. That is the mandate with which they entrusted us in the elections. Under the new Treaty, Parliament now has the ability, and thus also the obligation, to monitor and co-advise on the politics of the European Union – and that also covers the conduction of negotiations by the Council, including, for example, in the area of international agreements. We can only do that, however, if we have the relevant information. Sadly, that is very often not the case at the moment. You will remember numerous debates here in Parliament and amongst the public. As an example, I will just cite the major subject of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), where we had to negotiate on far-reaching international agreements without having all the documents available to us, without being really able to judge what exactly had been agreed and with what intentions.</p>
      <p sl="de">That needs to change, and it will do as a result of this agreement, which we, Parliament, have concluded through exhaustive negotiations with the Council. The matter at hand was that we should have access to all such documents in future, and how and under what conditions that would be realised. The documents in question are not only negotiation documents in the sense of negotiations that have already been concluded. Relevant documents also include those concerning the planning for negotiations, strategic drafts. These are internal documents, confidential documents. Other documents involved include secret and top secret documents, for which reason it was necessary for us to agree a step-by-step procedure in this agreement for how such documents would be handled.</p>
      <p sl="de">We were able, however, to get to a situation where, for example, all confidential documents are available to the Members of this House without special security checks. In the case of highly confidential, top secret documents and similar, special procedures are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one thing that I would like to say to my fellow Members, and that is that knowledge is power. Parliament needs this knowledge if it is to keep a check on the Council. It is also necessary, however, for us to behave responsibly with the knowledge that we acquire in this way. Not every piece of information that is made available to us in this way is one that we can and may use in connection with the outside world. I am sure that my fellow Members are aware of this. It is in any event necessary, however, and it is a very important step in the development of European democracy that Parliament has now reached an agreement of this kind not only with the Commission, but also with the Council, and will now have access to these documents.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to know what the EU does, for example, in the negotiations on the world trade agreement, on climate change, on bilateral trade agreements, and so on. What are the negotiating lines? What are the objectives being pursued in the negotiations? We want to, we have to and we will get involved in that regard on behalf of the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say one more thing in conclusion. We are by no means finished with this subject. At the moment, for example, we are negotiating about the law concerning commissions of inquiry where this House wants to investigate where there have been incidents of abuse and misdemeanours. Once again, we have the same problem with the Council, but also with the Member States, in that they do not want to grant us direct access to essential documents, in that we are denied access to certain witnesses and other things besides. We need to work hard to obtain that on behalf of and in the interests of the citizens and in the name of democracy. Otherwise, we cannot perform our important function for the citizens here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today, however, we can record a great step forward. I would like to thank all those involved for their collaboration, and I wish the agreement good luck.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, congratulations to our negotiating team and its leader, Mr Häfner, for reaching an important agreement. This is never easy, especially when two institutions are involved and one of them is being granted new powers, and all the more so in a field as sensitive as that of classified information. In this case, our negotiators succeeded in bringing about a really mature agreement, which provides us with sensible agreements for getting access to classified information held by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">What may seem to many a technical matter is, in fact, another step towards the practical realisation of the long-standing demand for more democratic scrutiny of what the Union does. This is in line with the Lisbon Treaty and the provisions on transparency which, for many years, have been the priority of this House in the various Treaty changes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because Parliament takes its decisions responsibly, we need the fullest picture possible, and this agreement provides us with a tool for obtaining it. As Mr Häfner has said, it is a part of a larger process of fighting for the prerogatives of this House, be it with regard to committees of inquiry or access to information in the field which has just been negotiated or, for example, in the field of common foreign and security policy, an area that still lies ahead of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our negotiating team has done a very good job; the legal framework and the principles are there. Now it is imperative that Parliament, too, does its job and puts in place a system so that the agreement can be implemented and exploited in practice as soon as possible. We should also not lose sight of the fact that the agreement still leaves some room for interpretation. I can only hope that, on the part of the Council, the good spirit in which it was conceived will continue throughout the process of its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know that sincere cooperation between the institutions is enshrined in the Treaties, but it is good to see it employed in practice, especially as there is still another missing piece of the puzzle of a more comprehensive democratic oversight of the Union: access to classified information on common foreign and security policy, which I have mentioned, has yet to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Basically, there is one message here: thanks to this interinstitutional agreement, we can carry out our duties in this House much better, in a more informed and effective way, and we can hold the Council to account in a transparent manner: and that has been Parliament’s priority in consecutive Treaty changes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Häfner, of course, for his report, which we will debate today and later vote on.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we consult democracy manuals or specialist studies, we can find many definitions of democracy. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, democracy is, above all, a system of public opinion and transparency. Not only are governments accountable to citizens, but they must also answer to them.</p>
      <p sl="es">For Parliament to fulfil its main functions, namely to legislate and control those who govern, it requires information and transparency. Only in this way can Parliament fulfil its role of representing citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreement under discussion today contains three important points that I wish to emphasise: it increases the dignity of Members, since we can access that information from within Parliament; it enlarges the categories of members who can access that information, given that rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and members of the committees concerned can do so; and, finally, it reduces the areas of classified information for which a Member needs some kind of approval to have access to it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, it is a positive step forward. As was previously mentioned, the following remains to be developed: how we approach classified foreign and common security policy information in a more orderly manner; and it remains for the Council and Parliament to cooperate in good faith in order to move this type of agreement forward without any clashes.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to thank those who initially carried out negotiations on behalf of Parliament: Ms Harms, Ms Wallis, Mr Lehne and Mr Swoboda.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – I wanted to ask Mr Guerrero Salom if he sees a difference between the Council and Parliament when it comes to the question of confidentiality.

      <p sl="es">Blue-card answer. – Well, in reality, what this agreement does is to limit the range of classified information; not imposing an overall limit as such, but rather allowing Members to access this information without requiring any security clearance. Of course, with regard to public information, there should be less stringent regulations for Parliament than in the case of strictly private information, where respect for people’s fundamental rights should be weighed against Parliament’s access to such information.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I also wish to thank Mr Häfner and the other shadow rapporteurs for their excellent levels of cooperation. We are, in fact, of exactly the same opinion: we support openness and the notion that citizens have a right of access to information. However, Parliament also has a right of access to information; otherwise, we cannot monitor events or influence matters.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is good that Parliament and the Council have at last reached agreement on this question of mutual public access. Unfortunately, of course, it has to be said that there is barely any progress being made in this area: it is just that current practices are being recorded.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is regrettable, as was said here previously, that this agreement does not cover foreign and security policy issues. We can no longer have a situation today where foreign and security policy is the sole right of a certain elite and not even Members of Parliament or Members of the Committee are given the information that they need to take decisions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to look ahead, however, and, hopefully, the next agreement will be common to all institutions, so that the same rules on public access to documents apply to Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I start by thanking Mr Häfner for his work as rapporteur. I am very pleased to say that my group supports this agreement. This House has important work to do in holding the Commission and the Council to account. It is important that we ensure that taxpayers’ money is well spent and that the laws and policy of the EU are carried out as they should be, in an open and transparent manner. This agreement with the Council is of a broadly similar nature to the one that already exists with the Commission, and I welcome that.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to balance the need for transparency with the legitimate right of nation states to the confidentiality of some documents, and I believe that this agreement achieves that balance, so I am very pleased to support the report. I think it will lead to better governance of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I have some interesting information to share: we recently put some parliamentary questions to the European External Action Service (EEAS), the Council, the Commission and a written question to the Secretary-General of this House. The aim was to find out how many classified documents are in circulation in the European Union. The results were as follows. The Commission gave us no information about this at all, arguing that the administrative outlay involved would be too great. At this point, once again, I will thus make my appeal to the Commission to please publish the figures relating to the number of classified documents.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the Council, there was an astonishing amount of transparency: we were provided with a list, broken down by level of classification, of how many documents the Council worked on. Hats off to the Council for that.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the EEAS, the answer was relatively mixed. As far as the legal basis in relation to the exchange with Parliament is concerned, we should look into this again and work on it. The result when it comes to this House itself was also very interesting. The answer we received was that, over recent years, only 10 documents classified as restricted have been handed over to Parliament. If you consider that there are more than 10 000 classified documents in the European Union’s network every year, we need to say very clearly at this point that the European Parliament is evidently being excluded from the information flow of classified documents, and that is certainly incompatible with Parliament’s supervisory role.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will conclude by arguing that it would be useful for the individual institutions to also publish on their websites the number of classified documents that they work on so that people could get a picture of whether or not that number was rising. They could potentially also include other information.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the House for this debate. It goes without saying that we are not working on our own behalf here, but on behalf of Europe’s citizens, and we have very important work to do in this connection. It is our obligation to monitor and supervise the work of the institutions, including the Council. It is our obligation to co-advise, including as part of our responsibility for the budget, as part of our responsibility for legislation. We can only assume this responsibility if we have the necessary information. Knowledge is power, and especially so in politics, particularly where one side knows something that the other does not. Dictatorships always use this tool of keeping important information hidden, of preventing the citizens from learning certain information.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we need is transparency. With the vote today, we will be taking a major step in that direction. I am very familiar with the complaints, which are aired repeatedly, that people have not obtained this document or that. That, too, must be stated clearly. We have concluded an agreement today. The practice now needs to be developed. The culture of trusting cooperation, of a proactive exchange of information, needs to develop, but I am confident that it will. There is one thing that I can clearly say in this regard, which is that we do not know whether we will always get all the documents straight away from now on. We do know with absolute certainty, however, that there is a whole swathe of relevant documents that we would not receive without this agreement. Parliament cannot be expected to debate and decide upon an agreement such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) without being able to review the necessary documents. The same applies to other subjects, such as the dialogue on human rights with China, in which connection my colleague, the committee chair Ms Hautala, had to go to the Council, following lengthy negotiations, at which point she was allowed, as committee chair, to peruse a couple of documents. The committee, however, was not able to see the documents, nor was the rapporteur. That needs to change. It will change. This is a major step towards greater transparency, and transparency is the prerequisite for a functioning democracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to invite all my fellow Members to make proactive and sensible use of this new right so that we can do our job. Finally, I would like to thank all those involved, both in the Council and here in Parliament, where I would like to offer my particular thanks to Mr Lehne, Ms Wallis, Ms Harms and Mr Swoboda.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain permitted uses of orphan works (COM(2011)0289 – C7-0138/2011 – 2011/0136(COD)) (A7-0055/2012).</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, an enormous number of works stored in European archives and libraries cannot be made available because the authorship of these works cannot be established or it is not possible to reach copyright holders, which is necessary in order for them to give their consent for the works to be made available. Works that are locked away in this manner often constitute up to 45% of the entire collections of these institutions. Cultural heritage should be useful to society and not just be imprisoned by copyright. This issue affects all kinds of publications: books, newspapers, photographs, radio and TV recordings. Speaking as a person who has worked for many years in the cultural sphere, it is important for me for this problem to be resolved on a legislative level throughout the European Union in order to return these forgotten works to society by digitising them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased that in March of this year, the Committee on Legal Affairs adopted my report on the use of orphan works. It states that, if extensive investigations show that identifying the author or the copyright holder of a work is not possible, the work can achieve ‘orphan’ status. This means it will be possible to make the work publicly available on a non-commercial basis, which means without making a profit. It will also be possible to store and restore works digitally. In addition, a work that has been deemed to be an orphan in one country will automatically gain ‘orphan’ status in others. If, however, the author or copyright holder comes forward, then they can request appropriate compensation if they can show that they incurred real losses by their work being made available in this way. In my opinion, this is an excellent example of the fact that relaxing rather than strengthening copyright law could be beneficial for all parties. During my work as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I have conducted negotiations on this issue, first of all with the Council under the Polish Presidency, then under the Danish Presidency, and today my report will be put to the vote in plenary, which will mean the realisation of one of the priorities of the Cyprus Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The creation of a derogation to the law on intellectual property in order to make cultural heritage available through public institutions for educational purposes and in order to disseminate culture will open a new chapter in intellectual property law. This is a particularly important directive, since it is the first to establish a legislative basis in a new and so far unregulated area of law. As a result, the beneficiaries, who so far have avoided digitisation out of concerns about any court cases for huge amounts of compensation if an author should come forward, can now breathe easily. Compensation worked out by way of a compromise will ensure legal certainty in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Works that have many owners, that is, so-called ‘partial orphan works’, can also be digitised and made available to a wide range of users. Libraries, archives and museums have long been waiting for clear regulations that would allow them to make available treasures that have been hidden away for years and to prevent them from being forgotten or even destroyed. The digitisation which, thanks to this directive, will finally be possible, solves this problem. However, what is most important, and this I count as one of the greatest successes in our negotiations, is that thanks to the new Article 6(2), public institutions will have a real opportunity to generate income from the use of orphan works, which will supplement the small sums allocated for the digitisation process.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Commercial use of works is given a precise definition in the text and is linked to the issue of compensation for the author if the author should appear. As regards this issue, too, I believe that we were able to reach a balanced compromise between protecting copyright and the possibility of a derogation for the use of orphan works. What is more, we put in a provision in the review clause stating that, a year after the directive comes into force, the European Commission should consider its effects and introduce any changes or improvements that are required and, if necessary, also introduce a wider range of beneficiaries to include, for example, private institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The negotiations were difficult. We did not always agree on all the issues but I am pleased with the final compromise solutions and am convinced that this directive will be a useful and effective tool to make cultural artefacts that have been hidden away available to a larger number of users. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs as well as the European Commission and the Council for the fruitful negotiations.</p>

    <intervention id="4-026-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, today, the European Parliament is about to vote on a legislative proposal that will enable the cross-border use of, and access to, so-called ‘orphan works’. This is an important milestone because this directive will help our public libraries, archives, museums, educational establishments and broadcasters to bring a significant part of the EU’s cultural heritage back to life. It will allow this heritage to be more easily available online for all our citizens to enjoy.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal is important not only because it is a tangible implementation of the intellectual property strategy adopted by the Commission last year, but also because it proves that by working together, it is possible to bridge the gap between copyright and technology in the Internet age. I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Angelika Niebler, Ms Alexandra Thein and Mr Christian Engström, for their constructive and collaborative approach, which made it possible to reach a compromise agreement at first reading with the Council and the Member States. Let me take this opportunity also to congratulate the Presidencies of Poland, Denmark and now Cyprus for their work and their commitment to ensuring a successful outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal before us targets the specific copyright issues relating to orphan works. The lack of knowledge about who owns the rights to a literary, musical or audiovisual work presents our cultural institutions with a dilemma: how can they digitise and put the works online, so that everyone can access them without infringing copyright. The directive resolves that dilemma. It provides our cultural institutions with the legal certainty they need to use orphan works, once they have carried out a diligent search to identify the rights holders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The text before us is, in some ways, different to the one that we presented to you last year. I will mention, for example, the inclusion of unpublished works and of so-called ‘partial orphan works’, or the setting up of an EU-wide database on orphan works, which will avoid the multiplicity of databases at national level and make it easier for rights holders and beneficiaries to check the status of the use of orphan works. These are very positive changes that the Commission welcomes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also welcomes the flexibility shown by the colegislators to enable the beneficiaries to retrieve some of the digitisation costs by allowing them to generate revenues when they use orphan works in the pursuit of their mission of public interest. This is an important consideration, especially given the economic difficulties we currently face.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to mention that reappearing rights holders, as the case may be, will be entitled to fair compensation for the use made of their works if a number of criteria are fulfilled.</p>
      <p sl="en">The constructive discussions that we have today and have had over the past year demonstrate our mutual interest in building a digital single market, step by step, block by block, but we must make sure that both European citizens and our cultural institutions are in a position to reap the benefits of the directive as soon as possible. I therefore urge the Council, after Parliament, to support the compromise text agreed in trialogues last June. I would also like to call on the Member States to ensure a timely implementation of the directive once it enters into force.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the new directive will provide a basis for dealing with books, newspapers, works of art, films, pieces of music and television productions that are protected by copyright, but for which the rights holder cannot be identified or cannot be located. Under the directive, books, films, photographs or other intellectual creations for which no rights holder can be found are to be made available to the public. This will create a cultural treasure trove. For us in the Committee on Culture and Education, it was of very particular importance to emphasise the special importance of the diversity of the cultural heritage of the European Union in this legislative initiative. In the archives of our museums, libraries, publishing houses and broadcasters, countless unused works are to be found which, until now, were not made available purely because the rights holders were unknown.</p>
      <p sl="de">This directive will change that. It will make it possible for these cultural assets to be used in future, provided that it is ensured that a diligent search is carried out before publication. This is a very important point, as it prevents people from breezily declaring that the rights holder just cannot be found. There is a need, after all, to find a balance between the real, existing rights of the creators of works and the public’s need to be able to use works where the rights situation cannot be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, there is a particular focus on the need to ensure that both known and unknown rights holders must continue to be fully protected. Where rights holders cannot be found, the proposals make it possible to make use of the digitisation of the orphan works. Projects such as Europeana, and other major European digitisation projects, but also our museums, archives, educational institutions and public broadcasters, will benefit from this arrangement.</p>
      <p sl="de">In future, however, orphan works in the archives of private publishers must also be made available to the public. In my view, this draft directive and the compromise that has now been reached really represent a compromise and a first step in the right direction. I believe that the cultural treasure trove that is up for grabs holds an enormous potential. We should continue to work on that when we revise the directive in two years’ time.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Lidia Geringer, our shadow rapporteur, Angelika Niebler, whom I am standing in for, and the other shadow rapporteurs for the efforts they have made and for truly allowing us to reach a very broad consensus on this text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The adoption of this directive provides a solution to a particular problem, that is the use of books, archives and other works protected by copyright when the rights holders have not been identified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have succeeded in striking a balance between protecting authors and creators, meaning that a diligent search should be carried out prior to use of the work, and the interests of libraries, museums and public service broadcasters. Let us not forget that these bodies contribute to the preservation and dissemination of European cultural heritage. It was essential to allow them to use these works, but also to finalise agreements, including public-private partnership agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must understand that this directive is not the final step but merely an additional step towards our objective: the large-scale digitisation of our cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This directive will coexist with other national regulations and with initiatives at European level, such as the Memorandum of Understanding on Key Principles on the Digitisation of Out-of-Commerce Works, which was signed on 20 September 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With the adoption of this directive on orphan works, we are showing that copyright is not a hindrance, but rather a response to the needs and expectations of users in the digital age.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Respect for intellectual property goes hand in hand with the development and provision of new digital services, and it therefore encourages the growth of this economic sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for the results of her negotiations with the Council. I know that it was difficult to also get the numerous good ideas that we had in Parliament through the tough negotiations with the Council. Certainly, with the directive, we have now found a viable route to granting works of literature orphan work status and preserving this cultural heritage for the future while making it accessible.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I do still have some minor doubts about whether we have really found an efficient solution for audiovisual works. Across the EU, a cultural asset has accumulated in the archives, especially of broadcasters after 1945, that is of inestimable value. Preserving this cultural heritage for the future, too, poses an enormous challenge on both a technical and financial level. The number of rights holders for audiovisual works is frequently higher than for written works. The diligent search that, under the directive, will also be necessary for audiovisual works takes a form that is therefore intensive in terms of costs, time and personnel.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a great cultural policy interest in preserving our audiovisual heritage, especially in this Internet age. We now need to carefully observe whether we have succeeded, through this directive, in noticeably reducing the number of audiovisual works in the European Union that are unusable in practical situations due to the rights being unclear. The review clause offers us a good opportunity here. In any case, we need to prevent audiovisual material in the archives going to waste as unrecoverable because it proves too costly to clear up who holds the rights. It goes without saying that, for orphan works, too, rights holders must be given reasonable remuneration. The involvement of collecting societies and other rights declaration systems here could help to remove uncertainties about rights, allow originators to come into their own, and thus also to release cultural treasures.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would have liked to have seen a little greater progress at this juncture, but the first step has been taken, and I believe we will work on this further over the forthcoming years.</p>

      <p sl="sv">It has been hard to find a good balance between safeguarding the facility for libraries and archives to make literature available, including orphan works, and having reasonable rules to protect authors, who have nevertheless created these works that, with time, have come to be orphan works, but which can still give pleasure and hope and a belief in the future to readers of our time. I believe that we have found a reasonable balance in this directive. For this, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to everyone involved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very sad to say that I am very disappointed today. This was a very good opportunity, and I think we missed it. There was a proposal from the Commission, which was limited in scope and I would have wanted it to be better, but it was good. Unfortunately, it got watered down, first by the processing in Parliament, then in the Committee and then in the trialogue. So, what we have now is a directive that, on the surface, if you read it through quickly, gives the impression or the hope that it will be helpful. I do not think it will be, in practice, because there are so many details that restrict what the museums, archives and libraries are allowed to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is one very good thing in this directive: it introduces the new principle of mutual recognition of orphan work status after a diligent search. That is a very good and sensible principle. This means that, for example, if it is a Swedish author, you only have to search in Sweden – unless there are specific reasons to think that an author may be found elsewhere but, basically, for a Swedish author you search in Sweden, and then it is declared orphan all over the Union. That is good, but where are the provisions?</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission proposal, there was an Article 7 that allowed museums and libraries to do some, quite limited, searches but still to have some commercial possibilities – that was taken out. Instead, what was inserted in it was that the museums and libraries will have a liability if they digitise and make available a work and the right holder reappears. Now, we all agree that, if a right holder reappears, he or she should have the right to say: take it down, here I am, and this is mine. That is fine. But what was added also was that the museums and libraries have to pay compensation. Now, the risk is that this will make the directive more or less useless anyway because, if they do not have the legal certainty, there is a big risk that they will not dare to digitise our common cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all want the same thing here. We would all love to see Europeana filled with lots of works from every Member State. Unfortunately, I do not think this directive will do that. Ms Gallo said that this is not the end of the road, and I want to pick up that. Several other speakers have also said that this is a first step. Yes, it is a first step. It is a very small step, but we will have to return to this. We have not solved the problem, and that makes me a little bit sad.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the same thing that happened to our colleague almost happened to me because I did not see the change to the agenda and because I was in a meeting at the other end of the House. Forgive me then, for I am a bit out of breath and, more importantly, I hate to take the floor when I have not heard what has been said. Please forgive me, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The digitisation of cultural works represents a serious issue: the issue of access to our heritage for as many people as possible. However, it must be done with strict respect for copyright, and therefore by guaranteeing remuneration for authors. Reconciling these issues is the focus of our debate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is rather tragic that European citizens do not have access to part of this cultural heritage because the authors are not or are no longer known. The digitisation of works must therefore come about through strict respect for the public interest missions of the public bodies concerned. Yet, in this period of budgetary austerity, forgive me, but it seems to me that Google is casting something of a shadow over our work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within our group, we are concerned about the use of certain provisions contained in the draft that has been presented to us. Why, for example, should out-of-commerce works be excluded when many of these are orphan works? What is worse is that respect for public-private partnerships risks leaving the door wide open for the commercialisation of this sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is for these reasons in particular that our group will abstain on this text, as it still includes far too many questions in our view.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to start by offering my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur and my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs for their enormous determination and negotiation skills, which were essential when working on this directive. This directive, like all other projects relating to the issue of protecting intellectual property rights, aroused considerable emotion and controversy. Regulating access to works that are real cultural treasures, but which are currently languishing on the shelves of libraries and numerous archives may seem to be a very small step, but it is, without doubt, a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the present atmosphere of general confusion surrounding the very definition of intellectual property and the rights conferred by that definition, in an atmosphere of heated discussion that pays little attention to substantive issues but is inflamed by various groups which – using defence of liberty as their catchword – are interested in obtaining free access to almost anything that someone else has created or invented, especially if such access should take place via the Internet, Ms Geringer de Oedenberg’s report is like a light in the darkness. It is a light which gives hope that a discussion concerning the protection of creative thinking in the European Union will take place at a realistic level, supported by proper arguments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Work on this dossier has shown that it is possible to bring together views that initially appeared to be very divergent. What is necessary, and perhaps this needs to be spelt out, is to undertake a dialogue based on rational argument that takes into account the situation both of the creators and of the users. For this reason, I also hope that work on future legislation in the area of intellectual property will be conducted in the spirit of substantive discussion that does not get exploited for populist appeals and various types of political manoeuvring.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg for her most patient and persistent work, which has led to a result that we look upon favourably, despite a number of question marks.</p>
      <p sl="it">The directive we are going to adopt is important, not only because it increases the number of people with access to artistic and original works – which, in itself, is highly significant – but also because it marks a break from a position which, to date, has had a negative effect on the spread of culture: a reverence for copyright to the extent of wishing to defend it even if there is no right holder, who might have died or is unconcerned.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, the narrow-mindedness of collecting societies is an obstacle to the spread of culture, which is why we have arrived here with delays and with great difficulty. I refer, for example, to attitudes on access for blind people to cultural works and attitudes on private copying. On this issue, we have found ourselves confronted with a kind of wall, which today – thanks to this measure – we have been able to demolish or at least breach.</p>
      <p sl="it">The measure we are going to adopt has great political significance and the step forward we are about to take surely deserves our approval. There are, no doubt, some shortcomings – so I also understand some of the concerns raised by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance – but these do not add up to a reason to fail to grasp this opportunity and the significant innovation that this step represents.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fortunately, Mr Barnier has tabled the regulation on collecting societies under debate in our committee, so we are addressing this critical issue in order that the whole range of arguments and topics relating to copyright can be dealt with in the right way.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a good proposal, which we think needs amending and improving but is worthy of support, thus convincing us yet further to vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, in committee, we were unable to adequately exploit the opportunity offered by an ambitious Commission proposal. I am assured by practitioners in the field that access to European cultural assets will not, to this extent, open up access to our cultural heritage following the entry into force of this legislation. In essence, the truth is that, the longer the duration of copyright – and sadly we extended that a little while ago – the bigger the problem. It goes without saying that the same situation applies to orphan works.</p>
      <p sl="de">A documentary in which the writer of a piece of music played in the background can no longer be traced will ultimately remain barred and not traceable for us, as the devil is in the detail of this legislation. We have built in a great many small obstacles to making works available. With this decision, we have lifted the lid on Europe’s cultural treasure chest just a little bit but, unfortunately, we have not opened the chest itself so that we can all be proud of our cultural inheritance, and across borders, too.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, in my opinion, the fine wording of the directive on cultural heritage masks the interests of the monopoly groups trading in the digital technology and Internet sector. The purpose of the directive is not, as agreed with the Council, to save, maintain, promote, disseminate and grant access to cultural creations and heritage; it is a highly profitable activity in the form of the large-scale digitisation of archives and collections and the creation of European online libraries.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, everyone agrees that our European cultural heritage should be disseminated and that so-called orphan works should be freely accessible, but that is not what is at issue here. The directive uses cleverly worded provisions to very openly pave the way for the commercialisation of orphan works and use of them for the benefit of private capital. Thus, firstly, research to locate authors can be outsourced to private companies for a consideration and, secondly, digitisation can be outsourced to private individuals, through public-private partnerships, and user charges can be imposed on the pretext of the digitisation of such works. Thus, the entire job of digitisation and sales will be handled by business groups and the workers will be required to pay dearly to use these works. We see yet again that all decisions by the European Union result in commercialisation. This policy lays a bomb under the foundations of culture and is a policy that must be changed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Ms Geringer de Oedenberg and my fellow Members who, through their excellent work, have helped to bring to life one of the key actions of the Digital Agenda for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">The directive we are shortly to approve will help achieve two fundamental goals in the development of European copyright. First of all, it will enable the dissemination and enjoyment of works that otherwise would have risked disappearance from our cultural heritage. This initiative therefore fulfils one of the undisputed cardinal rules of copyright, namely, the protection and promotion of culture and intellectual creations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, this directive will make it possible to modernise and improve Member States’ legal frameworks by bringing existing legislation into line with technical developments and the need for greater flexibility. This will help boost the economic benefits of copyright by ensuring fair remuneration for work and identifying any rights holders under an absolutely solid regulatory framework.</p>
      <p sl="it">Turning to the use of orphan works for commercial purposes, I support the approach taken by this House, which allows commercial use solely in order to pay for the costs associated with the public service carried out by the various relevant institutions. Indeed, the directive does not address issues relating to profit-seeking utilisation of orphan works, but rather legitimate and cross-border access to such works, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity and depth of Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, most of which, unfortunately, lays unused in the archives and libraries of the Member States and is not accessible to European citizens. In order to maintain the diversity of European culture, it is therefore necessary to make these works available at cross-border level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Orphan works are works whose right holder cannot be identified or found. We are therefore not coming into conflict with copyright ownership. Making works available to the public, however, requires the permission of the rights holders, in accordance with the principles of copyright.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Currently applicable European legislation does, however, provide for certain exceptions that allow scanning for preservation purposes, but they do not allow libraries to make the digitised works available online on the Internet, even for non-commercial purposes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We live in the digital era, however. The rational dissemination of information online can bring enormous advantages to the internal market. We should also be encouraging the digitisation of cultural material at European level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Parliament has, in the past, expressed its support for the idea of finding a legislative solution to the problematic area of these so-called orphan works. A new law in the future will enable Europe-wide online access to these works. The Commission’s proposal is therefore more than welcome.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Copyright is the foundation for innovation, creation, investment and production in the creative industries. We must, however, improve the system currently in force and adapt it to today’s digital world. Online accessibility of the so-called orphan works across the EU will lead to the promotion of Europe’s cultural diversity and to broader sources of knowledge and education.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would like to thank the members who spoke before me and also the rapporteur. I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. It is still a shame that this is a directive and not a regulation because, as you know, I am strongly in favour of regulations which work in the same way in all Member States. However, now we will again see different ways of implementing the directive and that is a shame.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am pleased that copyright has been included in the directive and is now recognised as an economic basis for the creative sector. It is now unambiguously included and I hope we all agree on that point, because it is important. It is time we started thinking about new business models in the context of new technologies and the digital age because we have now been debating the issue of access to one thing or another and whether or not they may be copied for several years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that it is important that we as politicians, as Parliament, start looking for a new European approach to copyright in order to bring this debate to an end in view of the digital age that lies ahead. What is a shame, and what has not been included in the directive, is the provision that copyright only takes effect if the author is known. If orphan works are now digitised, and if the author becomes known only after the event, I fear this could lead to legal action that could throw up difficulties in terms of making that clear.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On balance, I think we have achieved a good outcome and I hope that Europe’s cultural heritage will become accessible to a wide audience as a result.</p>

From my point of view, there are open questions here, and there are also problems that have not been resolved.

We have fought for that for a long time. It is a tangible improvement. Further steps must follow.

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the guiding principle for the debate on the permitted use of orphan works must be the principle that access to culture and to the arts are citizens’ rights and important instruments for cultural, as well as social and economic, development and stimulation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The non-commercial use of orphan works could indeed add social and economic value to society as a whole, but we believe that copyright principles must be safeguarded. If used for commercial purposes, it is vital that compensation be paid to copyright protection organisations or to other state organisations, since direct remuneration of the authors, artists or creators is impossible in the case of orphan works.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, we repeat that the objective of this recognition must never be to promote the diffusion of the works for the purpose of consolidating the single market and competition between companies, which would allow the ownership of these works to be monopolised. It must solely be to disseminate cultural heritage in the different Member States and in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">The reasons for such praise lie, above all, in the acknowledgement of copyright as the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creation, investment and production. Dissemination of works, following their digitisation, is the main way to protect and enhance Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union has an extremely rich cultural heritage, but much of it lies unused in the archives and libraries of our Member States, totally inaccessible to citizens. It is therefore right to make these works as accessible as possible to all. Indeed, the EU’s true wealth is its cultural heritage, which is unequalled around the world but is often neglected and loses not only its cultural value, but its economic value as well.</p>
      <p sl="it">The compromise reached between protecting copyright and allowing public access is the best way to reverse this trend and breathe fresh life into our cultural heritage, without violating any rights. It is true that perhaps not all the goals have been met, yet the glass is surely half-full rather than half-empty.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Europe’s richness lies in its diversity: the diversity of sound recordings, films, books and cultural and scientific values. The problem is, however, that if we lock away so many of these works, all that withers away. If we cannot find rights holders and the search for them is so costly and associated with legal uncertainty, something is going badly wrong. That leads to these works not being orphaned, but lost. We urgently need innovation in Europe. Research and development are to be promoted. Clearly, in order to bring that situation about, we need simple legal, cross-border online access to these orphan works, as one piece in the jigsaw.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur, Ms Geringer de Oedenberg, and many of the shadow rapporteurs have produced a fine piece of work. I do note, however, that there are a few spanners in the works, as I see them, in the compromises. The report contains many positive elements. It is an important first step. The next step, however – and thank goodness that a review clause was provided – must be approached in an even more committed manner. It is good that this is being regulated at European level at all. It is good that the principle of mutual recognition is to be included. The rules governing partially orphaned works and, in particular, the practically significant rule that a database of orphan works is to be established, are particularly worthy of note.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rules governing the diligent search are sound in principle, as is the fact that we now talk of compensation rather than remuneration. Here, too, however, you can see the glass as half-full or half-empty, as legal uncertainties remain, and here, too, we may be dealing with something of a sword of Damocles for those who attempt to perform as diligent a search as possible when trying to discover the creator, but who have no ultimate certainty in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">The so-called ‘profit ban’ on profit-oriented exploitation is more than a fly in the ointment. I say the ‘so-called’ profit ban, as profits will clearly continue to be made, the question is always just, by whom? The majority of the works will thus continue to rest dormant.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to remind everyone of our own goal. We should prevent there being so many orphan works in Europe in the first place. In this respect, the long durations of protection are, of course, the major cause.</p>

I think that today, we can send two important and significant messages to our citizens. The first is that we have a great opportunity to speed up the digitisation of cultural works in Europe: all those hundreds of thousands of works that today are kept in the archives of museums and libraries and that cannot, for legal reasons, be made more widely available. Young people today – and this is particularly the case with young people – are mobile, so the issue of searching for cultural works is of profound importance and this is, in practice, available only via the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, thanks to the legal provisions that we are considering today, there will be an opportunity for all public institutions, libraries and institutes of learning to offer the possibility of publishing these works. I believe that all the solutions that have been used here, including, inter alia, mutual recognition of works, could be a good step in the direction of making cultural heritage in the European Union very widely available. Many congratulations to all those who worked on this directive.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, legal, cross-border online access to orphan works is fundamental to the fostering of our diverse cultural treasures in Europe. The directive to be adopted will finally enable public institutions in Europe – libraries, museums, archives and the like – to dig out orphan works from their cellars, digitise them and thus make them available to the general public.</p>
      <p sl="de">After long and also difficult discussions in Parliament and with the Council, we have found a solution that serves both the individual rights holders’ interest in the reasonable protection of their works and the public interest in the distribution of such works. We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, in particular, insisted that there must be a truly thorough and effective search for the rights holder whose rights are to be protected before a work is published. If the rights holder makes himself/herself known at a later date, he/she should be due at least reasonable compensation.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that we have put a stop to purely commercial use of such works. On the other hand, public institutions, especially in times of tight purse strings, depend on private bodies to assist them with the digitisation. Public-private partnerships are exactly the right approach to take in order to make as many works as possible accessible to the public. It is high time that the European Parliament finally made hitherto unused cultural heritage available to the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, as these negotiations were truly difficult and we had proposed various different ways forward at the outset. I do not share the view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that there is, to all intents and purposes, no value in this directive. I take the view that, if that were the case, the review clause makes it possible to overhaul the directive after two years. I am, however, quite sure that digitisation can get under way straight away now, and also that the necessary funds for that are available.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, this report is a good starting point for resolving the limited accessibility of European cultural heritage. Thanks to the legislative process regarding copyright protection and cultural and creative industries that was started at European level recently, Europe is beginning to catch up, and this has a positive impact on our competitiveness. Similarly, in respect of orphan works, we are attempting to find a solution to a need which will facilitate the work of researchers, students and EU citizens. The digital world often knows no bounds. An appropriate EU legal framework, however, can ensure the protection of copyright holders and users as well. Parliament has added substantive elements to this proposal, including an extension of its material scope to photographic works of art.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The directive intends to reduce the informational and knowledge gap between the United States and Europe. In the future, it would be better if European legislators did not just seek to respond to policies outside the EU. European legal culture has sufficient potential to ensure a well-functioning, modern background of legal protection even in cross-border cases.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in spite of the extraordinary wealth of European cultural heritage available, some works are not used, being stored in archives and libraries due to their status as orphan works. Copyright helps encourage innovation, investment and production. In other words, it provides the foundation for the creative sector. Thanks to the new legislation, digitisation could make it possible in the future to access these works online throughout Europe and even beyond. We are talking about books, newspapers, publications, films, musical works and TV productions whose authors cannot be identified and which will be able to be accessed legally via the framework created by the current proposal for a directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am personally in favour of cultural and educational institutions being allowed to use orphan works to meet specific objectives. In future, it is important to reduce the number of orphan works by establishing clear criteria for identifying and locating the authors of these works, who will therefore enjoy the rights to which they are entitled.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I believe that the collective sense of belonging to Europe is one of the cornerstones of the stability of the EU. One of the symbolic expressions of our sense of unity is European cultural heritage, which includes all Member State works of art. It also includes works of art whose copyright holders are unidentifiable, that is, orphan works. Ensuring the European publicity of such works and harmonising the various Member State legal practices in this regard is vital to the preservation of European cultural heritage. I find it unacceptable for works of art to go to waste because there is no person or rights management organisation that would authorise their use as rights holders.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I therefore support the proposal that works of art whose rights holders cannot be identified, even after long and thorough research, be allowed to be digitised and made available online throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, copyright is the economic foundation for the creative industry, since it stimulates innovation, creativity, investment and production. Mass digitisation and dissemination of works is therefore a means of protecting Europe’s cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Copyright is an important tool for ensuring that the creative sector is rewarded for its activities. Copyright holders should be entitled to end the orphan status of a work when they come forward to claim their rights to the work or to another protected item. Copyright holders who end a work’s orphan status should be offered appropriate compensation for the use of their works or other protected items under this directive, which will be determined by the Member State where the body using the orphan work has its registered office. Member States should be free to establish the circumstances for granting such compensation, including when payment is made.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, my apologies for the delay, which was caused by the previous meeting going over time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by offering my thanks to the rapporteur for her work on the amendments and on the whole text. I hope that this will resolve the legal difficulties in which we have been entangled and will provide wide-ranging access to orphan works. This is particularly important in the context of protests submitted by organisations involved in the dissemination of knowledge. They have been telling us for a long time now about the problems involved in using this type of material, for example, in audiovisual processes. The directive under consideration and the proposed amendments provide greater flexibility, particularly as regards non-profit activities, although these clauses would not appear to be well adapted to market requirements. As many as 69% of those asked on one website said that they were in favour of the possibility of using orphan works for profit. It is therefore worth considering the possibility of making further amendments to the directive in order to make it possible to use orphan works commercially. This would provide a strong stimulus to make them more widely available, and this type of change would also increase the number of potential beneficiaries. As regards the amendments themselves, I am pleased to see that the interests of any heirs of authors of works have been protected. On the other hand, this imposes legal conditions on institutions that are difficult to fulfil. Over the long term, this may mean the road that books, photographs and pictures have to travel before reaching a wide audience is somewhat longer.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to thank everyone for a fruitful discussion, as well as all the Members of the European Parliament for the excellent work that we have been doing together over the past year and a half. I am very pleased that soon, many pearls of our culture and heritage which have so far been hidden will see the light of day and be available to a wide audience, and I think that this is a first step, perhaps a small one, but nevertheless an important step, towards full harmonisation of copyright law throughout the European Union in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the Danish Presidency for very fruitful cooperation, and I would particularly like to thank Ambassador Liisberg. I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for many useful meetings and discussions, along with Commissioner Kroes who, one could say, was the fairy godmother for this project. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs, Angelika Niebler, who was a shadow rapporteur, and Mariella Gallo, who was very committed to the work. I would also like to thank Alexandra Thein, who is with us today, for her support, and also Christian Engström, even though we differed on some issues, but this was a very important discussion. I would also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs and all the assistants who worked with us.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The problem with orphan works is that consent is required from the work’s copyright holder for any legal use of the relevant work. If the author cannot be found and consent cannot be obtained, the relevant work cannot then be used. As protection lasts for a very long time (the author’s lifetime + 70 years) and the number of works published continues to grow, these cases are being encountered ever more frequently. Ignoring the fact that, in general, these works are actually used more often without consent being requested, I think that, legally speaking, there is a problem that needs to be resolved.</p>

      <p sl="hu">A major benefit of this agreement is that it provides legal certainty for public institutions, who will use these works more confidently as a result. I welcome the fact that the report also addresses the matter of rights holders being able to request that their works not be considered ‘orphan works’ and, at the same time, provides appropriate protection for public institutions. I believe that the latter refrain from using such works for fear that without the consent of the right holder, they could be fined millions of euro. It is not unusual for such works to constitute 70% of the collections of some institutions. Additionally, I would like to point out that I personally did not consider the European Commission’s legal policy starting point to be constructive; I feel that it is much more a partially negative response to the book digitisation project launched by Google. As such, the model to be introduced under the directive could certainly be able to effectively compete with this US company in the short and medium term, but in the long term, it would once again fall by the wayside due to the failure to establish a legislative environment enabling creative use in a digital environment. I commend the rapporteur for recognising this possibility; she guided the original proposal in the right direction, emphasising that we should move towards new areas in legislation as well. As Ms Geringer de Oedenberg mentioned, the new European model must facilitate the creation of a simplified procedural system. I fully agree with her on this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, may I firstly start by thanking my shadow colleagues who were very helpful throughout this ongoing process of reform that we are attempting to carry out.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is safe to say that we are not in the enviable position of having the perfect acquis . Where we need freedom, we find recommendations, green papers and communications, yet where we need action – such as the completion of the single market – efforts are sidelined by delayed implementation and long-awaited follow-up reports. Too often, the added value achieved by taking action at the European level is lessened by heavy-handed obligations or ill-conceived provisions. These may originate at the incubation stage in the Commission and find themselves added during Parliament or Council readings or through gold plating in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is today still occasionally remarked to me that any legislation at the European level is automatically bad: either it imposes excessive or unnecessary burdens, or it removes power from national governments or local authorities, or it fulfils any number of other stereotypes used to describe European legislation. I do not believe that this is true. Laws crafted and adopted at the European level help companies across Europe and from beyond to establish themselves in the largest market in the world with some 500 million potential customers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased therefore to present my report today, which I view as the latest in a number of steps which Parliament has taken to drive forward the better law-making agenda. Within the report, I have made several key messages become clear. The Commission as initiator of legislation, the Council as colegislator and the Member States as implementers should all take on board initiatives which we ourselves as a Parliament have put forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, concerning subsidiarity, I am very pleased to note that national parliaments have, for the very first time, been able to raise a yellow card procedure, which has hastened the withdrawal by the Commission of the Monti II proposal. It is encouraging that national parliaments have been able to finally take ownership of this avenue for expressing their views, but sadly it remains a difficult path to take successfully. All too often, Brussels is described as a distant and inaccessible bureaucracy, imposing rules from afar. It becomes an easy punchbag in domestic politics, where unwelcome decisions are disowned and cast as Brussels calamities, whilst positive achievements are reclaimed and touted as national triumphs.</p>
      <p sl="en">As rapporteur now for two reports on better law making, I am keenly aware also of internal problems faced throughout the institutions, for instance, concerning impact assessments. Partiality risks fatally undermining this process. I am constantly frustrated by impact assessments accompanying proposals which are clearly prepared to justify a certain policy choice. We must reject entirely policy-based evidence and insist on evidence-based policy making from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Essential in this regard is the Impact Assessment Board within the Commission. This is not sufficiently and robustly independent. We must also do our duty here in Parliament, and my report calls for systematic engagement by committees and MEPs with our new internal Impact Assessment Unit in order to aid the committees’ work of scrutinising proposals. I consider that this, in conjunction with the Commission’s routine presentation in their impact assessment at any initial exchange of views on legislative dossiers, would represent a significant step forward for evidence-based policy making in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that, in cases where European regulations would adversely affect our smallest businesses excessively, legislation should be left to a more local level where national nuisances can be appropriately addressed. We should, however, look to go further, and I am pleased that Parliament is able to affirm its commitments towards extending exemptions beyond micro-entities to small and possibly medium-sized entities where this would be justified.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see that I have run out of time. I will reserve my remaining comments for the two minutes which I get after the debate has taken place.</p>

    <intervention id="4-063-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="John Dalli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to comment on Parliament’s draft report on the 18th report on better legislation. First, allow me to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for its work in preparing this report. It is a welcome contribution to the smart regulation agenda, which the report acknowledges as a shared responsibility. It also highlights some very important issues concerning relations with national parliaments. The Commission will respond more formally to the report in due course but, for now, I would like to make a few general remarks on the smart regulation agenda, which remains a key priority for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, your report correctly indicates that impact assessment is a core element of smart regulation. The European Court of Auditors and other independent studies found that the Commission’s impact assessment system compares favourably to other systems in the European Union. The Commission strives to continuously improve its impact assessment system, for instance, by providing services with further operational guidance on the assessment of specific impacts such as sector competitiveness, fundamental rights or SMEs. The President has reinforced the role of the Impact Assessment Board so that, in principle, a positive opinion from the IAB is needed before a proposal can be put forward for a Commission decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes Parliament’s initiative in setting up an Impact Assessment Directorate and, in particular, the renewed commitment of Parliament to carry out impact assessments prior to the adoption of substantive amendments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is willing to exchange views, share methodology and background to its assessments with the Parliament, as already agreed in the common approach to impact assessments. We should all bear in mind, of course, that an impact assessment is not an end in itself. It should lead to better policy at the end of the decision-making process and is a joint responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report rightly places considerable emphasis on the need to minimise regulatory burdens for business. The Commission has proposed measures to reduce the administrative burden by 33%. We invite Parliament and the Council to approve pending proposals rapidly to bridge the small remaining gap and so ensure that we reach the 25% reduction target by the end of the year.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider that all future legislative proposals should be based on the premise that micro-enterprises, in particular, should be excluded from the scope of the proposed legislation, unless the proportionality of their being covered can be demonstrated. When they need to be covered, we should seek to find adapted solutions and lighter regimes for both micros and SMEs, and their impact should be analysed as an integral part of the impact assessment process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also strengthening the implementation of the Commission’s ex post evaluation policy. Now, all significant proposals must, in principle, be based on an evaluation of what is already in place. We are working on further developments to improve the way we do this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also focused on further improving implementation and consultation. The Commission will produce a scoreboard to show that proposals it has produced are having a significant impact on smaller business, to show what changes Parliament and Council adopt in the legislative procedure and how Member States implement the adopted regulatory measure, identifying best practice and any ‘gold plating’. The scoreboard will be updated on a yearly basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">A central element of the Commission’s approach is a strengthening of the involvement and consultation of small businesses in better law making. Conferences are already being held in Member States with small businesses and an EU-wide consultation process has been launched to identify the ‘Top Ten’ burdensome EU regulatory measures for review.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also strengthened the voice of stakeholders by extending the minimum period for public consultation from 8 weeks to 12 weeks, as of the beginning of this year. The Commission has also initiated a review of its consultation policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, a follow up to the 2010 Smart Regulation Communication, taking stock of the progress made and drawing lessons from experience, is planned for adoption around the end of this year. A 12-week public consultation was launched on 27 June.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report emphasises the importance of respect for the principle of subsidiarity when drawing up legislative proposals and stresses the importance of the participation of regional parliaments with legislative powers in this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Subsidiarity issues are key aspects taken into account by the Commission when carrying out its impact assessments and on which the Impact Assessment Board focuses when scrutinising the quality of impact assessments. The Commission is fully committed to ensuring that in future, subsidiarity justifications are better reflected in the explanatory memorandum of its proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning relations with national parliaments, let me reassure you that the Commission pays very close attention to the work of regional parliaments and even receives opinions directly from some of them. After all, we regularly encourage national parliaments to consult regional parliaments with legislative powers, where appropriate, in the process of subsidiarity scrutiny, as set out in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to making progress on smart regulation and looks forward to working with Parliament, the Council and the Member States to ensure effective delivery as a joint responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Dalli, Mr Karim, first of all, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would like to bring up a point that was very important to me in this report on subsidiarity and proportionality: for the first time since entering into force, the Treaty of Lisbon has shown its impact in the shape of the ‘yellow card’ for the national parliaments of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the first time, a sufficient number of the Member States’ national parliaments have taken the Commission to task for its interference in the competences of the Member States and thus brought down a European regulation. I am referring to Monti II, the proposed regulation on the exercising of fundamental social rights in the internal market. In my view and, above all, in view of the efforts to get out of the crisis through coming closer together and increased cooperation, this is an important instrument for democracy from both a political but also, in particular, from an economic point of view. Ultimately, we are all familiar with the discussions about the regulation of the financial markets – I only need mention the term supervision of the banks. Especially given this background, I believe that democratic legitimisation and parliamentary control by this House, but also by the national parliaments, are important instruments for democracy that are being actively promoted but which must also be explained to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another point that I would like to raise in this debate is the section of the report dealing with reducing administrative burdens. Obviously we all want – in all groups – to provide a sound working environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, I would like to specifically emphasise that a general exception from European directives for SMEs is not appropriate. When it comes to rules governing health and worker protection, it is an absolute no-go, as these directives, after all, lay down rules governing minimum European standards. There cannot be exceptions here, either for micro-enterprises or SMEs. Quite on the contrary, the Member States can, and should, provide advanced protection for workers in their countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the concepts of subsidiarity and proportionality are basic aspects of the policy-making process within EU institutions. The subsidiarity control mechanism which national parliaments have helps make the process more transparent. The majority of the Commission’s proposals have been adopted by national parliaments without any significant discussions taking place about subsidiarity. The only proper debates about the way to interpret subsidiarity have taken place between Parliament and the Council, ending up with a suitable balance being found between the responsibilities of the EU and those of Member States. In practical terms, it can be seen that implementing EU legislation is still a problem nationally, and I think that better communication between national parliaments and the European Parliament could improve this situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report touches on a number of issues which are particularly important for Parliament. I should mention among these the need to revise the interinstitutional agreement on better law making, adopting legislation on SMEs and, last but not least, making further improvements for better law making.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I should mention that there were no disagreements in the Committee on Legal Affairs between the main political groups, thereby enabling a compromise to be reached which will help clarify the reversal of the burden of proof for certain groups of businesses, which is something I would thank the main report for.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Karim for the excellent work he has done in this report. I would like to focus during these couple of minutes on an aspect presented in the report concerning the fact that the Commission needs to be better at explaining and justifying the European added value in the legislative proposals it tables. I would like to emphasise that I am saying this as a committed federalist who would like to see more common decisions and activities at European level. At the same time, we must improve in terms of clarifying and explaining, in simple terms, this European added value in the EU’s work. This applies not only to contact with our citizens; we must also improve our dialogue and cooperation with colleagues throughout the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is not enough that a few officials in the Commission and some Members of this House understand the purpose of the European added value in various proposals. We must get better at listening to citizens’ points of view and at explaining. This can then lead to a greater understanding of the intentions behind European legislation and, in some cases, also make it clear that we do not actually have sufficient grounds for legislating at European level. This is the context into which the whole issue of subsidiarity comes.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I hope that the Commission will now take these views on board. They are, in fact, particularly relevant on a day like today, the day after Mr Barroso’s speech in yesterday’s sitting. He noted something new, namely, that we need to have an important discussion about European added value and it must be conducted at all levels. In this process, I believe that Mr Karim’s report could be very helpful in clarifying not only the problems, but the solutions, too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the rapporteur has my heartfelt thanks. In the European context, better legislation is an extremely important subject, especially because – and this is also the coverage in the media – European laws are viewed as extremely complicated, incomprehensible and difficult to follow and use. However, and I want to stress this very clearly at this juncture, that is, to a very large extent, also down to the implementation in the Member States. Experience of recent years shows, you see, that national problems that governments would otherwise not dare to regulate are often tacked on to European rules. Naturally, the result is that the legislation is overstretched, and it thus becomes incomprehensible. This is a significant and important factor. In this connection, when it comes to the implementation of Union law, we have to raise this element much more strongly.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point that I find important – and the rapporteur concentrated very heavily on this – was the issue of impact assessments. I agree with him that political decisions should also be based on fact. At the end of the day, there can be no objection to that. That said, impact assessments can also be used to great political effect. I will illustrate with an example. When there was an impact assessment on the introduction of megatrucks, these enormous lorries, onto Europe’s roads, the Commission carried out an impact assessment, which predominantly looked into whether large enterprises would make more profits, rather than how much more public expenditure would be entailed. In other words, an impact assessment always depends on the criteria set for it. If we hide political convictions behind official impact assessments, we are not serving good law making well.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Sajjad Karim, for the excellent report and the work done.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I consider it a success that the report does not focus only on ex ante evaluations of the bureaucratic burden, but also re-emphasises ex post evaluation. In addition to the creation of new regulations based on impressions, completely irrelevant data and unrealistic evidence, one of the biggest sources of excessive regulation is the placing of further requirements above and beyond the directives by Member States themselves – so-called gold plating, as a previous speaker said. Significant reductions can be achieved in gold plating through ex post evaluations.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In my opinion, there is much sense in the idea of granting regulatory offsetting, which would require that, in advance of new legislation generating new bureaucratic and administrative costs, ways be found of offsetting these costs.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to end by repeating the view which I always express here when we are debating this topic – the view that the Commission finds the European Parliament lacking as a strong partner in the fight against bureaucracy. We should therefore start thinking about setting up a European Parliamentary committee on eliminating the bureaucratic burden.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, an elementary condition for the proper functioning of the legal system is a simple and transparent structure for rules which are comprehensible to the public and easy to enforce. Repeated comments made by national parliaments regarding the regulations adopted by the European institutions go to show that we do not always succeed in achieving this level of quality in our regulations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The most common criticism is directed at adherence to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality in the creation of legislation by European institutions. Also often criticised is the ambiguity of the legal language and lack of transparency of the legal system in which regulations even overlap in some areas.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary to continue efforts to improve law making at European level, both through better cooperation with national parliaments and through more effective use of electronic communications via the websites IPEX and REGPEX. Our efforts to simplify and clarify the EU legal system must be seen as a continuous process, and we must continue to pay it special attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the Karim report on better legislation in the European Union is unusual in that it is drawn up by Parliament each year. Every year, we try to show the areas where there is still much to be done, and I hope that this information from the European Parliament is taken into account both by Parliament itself and by the other legislators, namely the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This year, however, the discussion has a special character, as we are speaking at a time of economic crisis and also of a crisis of faith in the possibility and even the sense of developing the European institutions, as well as a crisis of faith in the institutions’ effectiveness. Our task is to revive the work of the European Union and to make it more effective, and to rebuild trust in European law – law that is, after all, reflected in national legislation. It is this issue of cooperation with our national partners, with national parliaments and with regional parliaments that is absolutely central. An example of just how important this is was the first ever use of the yellow card procedure against the Commission regarding the Monti II Regulations as well as the behaviour of the European Parliament – quick and effective – which led to the Commission withdrawing this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another key issue today concerns further reductions in the administrative burdens and barriers that make small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the driving force behind the European economy, look to us to make better laws so that they can function properly, freely and sensibly and create jobs, which is the most important way to combat the crisis. For this reason, I would like to thank Mr Karim and the other Members of the European Parliament for this year’s report, and I hope that its conclusions will soon be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, let me thank the rapporteurs. Well done!</p>
      <p sl="en">As pointed out in this report, the modified legislative environment introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon needs to be better reflected in European legislation, as provided for in the smart regulation agenda. Better law making means simplified, smarter and more transparent legislation, taking into account Europe’s multilayered governance. In that regard, I believe the closer involvement of national and regional parliaments in our legislative process needs to be reinforced, especially in the light of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have at our disposal very useful tools in relation to national contributions to EU law, such as the IPEX platform. However, the follow-up and the ex post control could, and should, be enhanced: firstly, through an improved statement from the Commission of the ground for its initiative (subsidiarity or proportionality), and secondly, through an extended timeframe for national parliaments to carry out subsidiarity checks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to underline the urgent need for an update of the 2003 interinstitutional agreement on better law making, and I look forward to discussing the upcoming Commission progress report on the Smart Regulation agenda.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, only simple and comprehensible law is good law. We issue European legislation in the public interest and for the benefit of the citizens. It is therefore essential that European law should be simple, easy-to-understand and accessible to everyone. As European legislators, we need to constantly monitor and optimise our work. That is what our citizens expect of us. It is important that we should have an ever more intensive exchange with the national parliaments in order to give shape to laws and act together as guardians of the principle of subsidiarity. In that way, we can ensure, together, that we really do only legislate at European level what is too much to deal with at national level. Good law making also includes not putting in place regulations that could be at least as well dealt with at national level. Particularly in these difficult times for the European Union, it is absolutely critical that European legislation should be accepted by everyone, including by our national elected representatives.</p>
      <p sl="de">The early warning mechanism established in the Treaty of Lisbon, which many people have labelled a paper tiger, showed its potential power for the first time yesterday. After reprimands about subsidiarity from 18 national parliaments, the Commission decided to withdraw its proposed regulation on collective striking law.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is cause to criticise the fact that there has still been no updating of the existing interinstitutional agreement on better legislation from 2003 to fit in with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty of Lisbon brought in changes in respect of secondary legislation. Given the immense practical importance of such legislation, the agreement needs to be updated.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, how refreshing it is to read a report which makes so much sense. Instead of getting out my red pen, I actually agree with a lot of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we should make international laws only where we actually need international laws; and, yes, where we make laws they should be clear and easy to understand. Yes, we need to think much harder about the consequences of our laws. Our impact assessments are not good enough, and then Parliament flings in amendments without thinking about the consequences. Yes, we need to work more closely with our national parliaments and, I would add, our local authorities, who often have to deal with our red tape. Yes, we must be aware of the burden of bureaucracy on our small companies and especially on micro-businesses – tiny businesses which, in many cases, should be excluded from much of our international law.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this report makes some valid points. It states in the first few paragraphs, I quote: ‘[The European Parliament] stresses that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality must be respected by the European institutions when legislating’. Unquote.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is, therefore, my most fundamental comment on this report. First of all, what we need is not the new European treaty announced by Mr Barroso yesterday. No, in reality, what we need is a thorough review of where and how European policy is really useful and necessary and where it is not useful or necessary at all. We also need to look again at how many European institutions, how many European administrations and how many European rules and regulations are really useful and necessary and how many are not useful or necessary. If we did, we would, in my opinion, not just be making huge savings for the taxpayers, but also paying real respect to the principle of subsidiarity, a lot more respect than just treating the symptoms, which is what we seem to have been doomed to so far.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, in reality, we are very far from that union of nation states which Mr Barroso advocated yesterday. One further comment. There seems to be a touch of euphoria about what we know as the ‘yellow card’ procedure. Let us be honest, we have hardly used it. It is merely a stopgap, an opportunity for national parliaments to have their say which, in reality, offers no opportunity at all.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that better legislation is an ongoing goal both of Parliament and of the institutional bodies that contribute, through colegislative powers, to giving a sufficiently clear and orderly framework for the more than 500 million EU citizens that expect clear, accessible and consistent laws.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, consistency is not just a political issue but must translate in real life into legislation that meets this fundamental requirement. It is important to highlight that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, this requirement is best met by close cooperation with national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need appropriate criteria for assessing the correct application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and, above all, we need the will to work out whether eight weeks are enough time for Member States to give the opinion it is their right to express.</p>
      <p sl="it">Institutional websites providing information for citizens are helpful, but we also need greater engagement from local bodies and regional levels of government. Lastly, evidence-based policy making may be combined with impact assessments on the legislative process to measure its effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="it">All of this contributes to building a properly simplified framework to avoid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) facing more costs than they do already and ensures that the gap between Brussels and Strasbourg, and between Member States and citizens, is reduced.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, for legislation at EU level to be effective, the legal regulations must, first and foremost, be clear, simple, easy to understand and accessible to all.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In the creation of European legislation, we must be guided by two fundamental principles of European Union law – the principle of subsidiarity and the principle of proportionality. I firmly believe that we must involve the national parliaments of the individual Member States in the European legislative process in a much more significant way, since they play an important role in monitoring the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">European institutions must also simplify and consolidate efforts in the area of better creation and simplification of EU legal regulations and also reduce the administrative and regulatory burden. Our goal is to ensure that European legislation is as close as possible to citizens and, in particular, that they understand it.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Let us also not forget the fact that subsidiarity may lead to an extension of the activities of the EU within the framework of its powers when circumstances so require and, conversely, to the action concerned being restricted or curtailed where it is no longer justified. Subsidiarity, in this context, not only applies to the relationship between the EU and its Member States, but also encompasses the regional and local levels.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, if one were to ask the average person in any European Union Member State what they think of EU law, the general response would probably be ‘too complicated and bureaucratic’. It is true that many EU laws are written in specialist language that is difficult to understand, and this makes it more difficult to appreciate the sense of decisions that are taken. This is, of course, partly justified by the nature of the law in question or by other factors which affect the final wording of a particular document.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nevertheless, the report we are discussing today is an important step towards bringing the European Union closer to ordinary people. We need laws that are simple, transparent and can be understood by everyone, and we need a reduction in the regulatory burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. We must make the Commission and the Council aware of the fact that increasing the number of laws drafted in impenetrable and specialist language will not help to make the European Union more popular with its citizens. Finally, legislation adopted by European Union institutions should be based on facts, and should be verified and checked frequently to ensure it is effective and useful because, in the final analysis, the legislation is being created for EU citizens and it is they who should benefit from it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur for his input into democratic control over European Union legislative processes. There is often talk of the growing deficit in this area, with some justification. Acting on the basis of treaties that are in force, both the European Parliament and national parliaments have an important role to play in the decision-making process. However, as can be seen from Mr Karim’s report, these rights are not always reflected in practice. It would appear from the rapporteur’s conclusions that the European Commission does not always abide by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality properly. According to national parliaments, this is sometimes evidenced by no justification being given, or only a partial justification, concerning the principle of subsidiarity in its initiatives. For this reason, greater weight should be given to the involvement of our national parliaments in the process of checking legislative proposals in the light of the above two principles.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, like the speakers before me, I would like to emphasise the urgent need for better controls – by our Chamber, too – of delegated and implementing acts that are issued, since important issues often escape democratic control through these procedures.</p>

This is why I welcome national parliaments being more closely involved in the European legislative process, particularly with regard to the legislative proposals on the scrutiny carried out based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. However, I find it regrettable that of the opinions received from national parliaments in 2010, only 16% of them raised subsidiarity concerns.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the use of the ‘yellow card’ procedure for the first time in May 2012 by adopting reasoned opinions opposing the Commission proposal for a Council regulation on the exercise of the right to take collective action within the context of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services. I welcome the introduction of the IPEX website, which can act as a catalyst for further improvements and greater involvement in the operation of the subsidiarity control mechanism. However, I think that national parliaments should arrange public debates on European legislative proposals. This is the only way to allow Member States, citizens, the administration and, above all, industry to prepare for proper implementation of European legislation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It will surely come as no surprise to many of you that the number of reasoned opinions has increased by almost 75% compared to 2010, the year under discussion, when the subsidiarity control mechanism introduced by the Lisbon Treaty came into operation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The number of reasoned opinions required for launching a yellow card mechanism was not reached, however, even in such controversial cases as the directive on maternity leave. It thus remains true that the real benefit of this control mechanism is wholly inadequate in practice.</p>

We are forgetting what von Pufendorf taught us, namely, that general laws should be few in number and they should be correctly understood. To that end, those who enact laws ought to be as clear as possible. Montesquieu always stressed that legal language must be precise and concise.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I suppose we should be grateful for the small mercies of subsidiarity and proportionality. The former tries, with very limited success, to prevent competences being exercised at EU level if they could be more efficiently exercised at Member State level. Indeed, when can they not? The latter attempts to prevent legislation going beyond, and I quote: ‘what is necessary to achieve the objects of the Treaty’. It is a pity we cannot cut off the last seven words and stop at the word ‘necessary’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to see a third principle being applied during the legislative process for as long as we have to put up with EU legislation at all.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I firstly thank all colleagues who took time to contribute to the debate. It is quite clear that there is a very real need for reform of our processes. The greater involvement of national parliaments and parliamentarians is something that needs to be introduced in a streamlined way so that our legislation takes full account of local factors where it is necessary for them to be included, and indeed provides us with much greater scope to decide whether we actually need to legislate at all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Non-compliance by some Member States, right the way through to gold plating by others, takes away the very reason for our existence. When we move forward with legislation – and we have a very heavy agenda in this Parliament regarding standardisation of processes – genuinely helpful measures become deeply unhelpful because they are applied in different ways. National parliaments today have the opportunity to be involved in our processes right from the outset. Therefore, hopefully, we take away their need sometimes to take those actions at a later stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to micro-entities and SMEs, they are the backbone of the EU’s economy. We can all recall that in 2005, President Barroso stood in this very Chamber and spoke about the unnecessary burdens that had to be taken away from that section of our economy. I came to this Parliament eight years ago from a background in law, business and politics. I knew only too well the burdens placed on SMEs, sometimes unnecessarily. Even now, their biggest complaint of unnecessary burdens remains the same and it is justified.</p>
      <p sl="en">It therefore gives me great pleasure to be able to move this report today to ensure that people are aware that we are taking their grievances on board. The circumstances dictate that this work is required. With citizens still feeling we are too distant, national parliamentarians remaining ill-informed of our processes, and a breakdown in confidence in our ability to face the huge challenges our Union now has, we must look to see where we can reform and improve. Post-Lisbon, and prior to the steady march into the unknown as announced by President Barroso yesterday, the best we can do is behave in a way our people can support: reform and take our people with us. President Barroso’s vision of moving without the people, by diktat, is not fitting for a modern Union fit for purpose.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The interinstitutional agreement on better law making that was adopted in 2003 must be adapted as soon as possible to the new legislative environment created by the Treaty of Lisbon, in particular, in respect of correlation tables and the demarcation between delegated and implementing acts. We must not allow the Council to blur the clear distinction between delegated and implementing acts, and we therefore urge the Commission to ensure the proper application of the two relevant articles. The agreement between the three institutions primarily aims at the increased coordination of the legislative process, but we must not forget about the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality either. I would like to point out that according to the principle of subsidiarity, the EU only acts in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence if and insofar as the objectives of the proposed action can be better achieved at EU level than at national, regional or local level. It is therefore essential for Community institutions to enable national parliaments to scrutinise legislative proposals by ensuring that the Commission provides a comprehensive and detailed reasoning to decisions concerning subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>

Such rules are unacceptable in my opinion, as is the fact that we have an obligation of secrecy in respect of information provided orally. It will never be possible to prove what we have or have not received through official channels, and therefore it will become a source of legal uncertainty.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Commission has notified us that it does not have information about most of the Member States’ agreements concerning energy. This means that it is unable to react to a situation where clearly unfavourable contracts are being concluded for supplies from outside the EU which, in turn, directly affects the energy security of the country in question. There is certainly good reason to increase the powers and involvement of the European Commission in negotiating international agreements and in assessing the legality of such agreements. I believe that such measures would initiate a rational price policy and would make it possible to reduce the colossal discrepancies in agreements made between individual countries and, for example, the Russian gas giant. Energy agreements with third countries also impact on the functioning of the internal energy market. Considerable investment is also required for development of the distribution infrastructure. In this context, the vital knowledge and assistance that the European Commission can provide should be used properly and the basic step towards achieving this goal is the sharing of information concerning negotiations and agreements that have been concluded.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, energy is a vital resource in all developed industrial countries, which therefore includes those in the European Union. The first thing we have to deal with is that the Member States, unfortunately, still act alone in this area. That is why collaboration at Union level is the first necessity. Secondly, there is a need to ensure the highest possible level of self-sufficiency in the energy field. Thirdly – and this is, after all, what our report, our amendment addresses – when it comes to energy imports, there is a need to ensure the necessary energy mix through intergovernmental agreements designed to bring about a great degree of stability. It is very important that Parliament should get involved here, too, and that the Commission should also have a seat at the table in the case of bilateral negotiations. Let me reiterate, everything that we decide here must be integrated with the European Union’s energy supply so that we will be able to continue to develop our economic basis in future, too.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, practically every region of the European Union has developed its own traditional methods of agricultural production, which have a bearing on the variety of products available throughout the EU. Local foods are often of great value for a given region. Farmers and consumers should be aware, first of all, of their quality, which also impacts on the presence and recognition of these products in European and world markets. This is helped by quality control systems supported by special markings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In supporting the resolution, I look forward to improvements in legislation relating to quality as well as to improvements in the operation of the certification systems. Transparency and ease of use of these mechanisms will make them less burdensome for producers. I am looking forward to an ever greater number of excellent Polish foodstuffs obtaining protection. I also agree with the rapporteur’s proposal that the quality assurance system should also apply to unprocessed products. This will make it possible to apply for protection for apples from the Mazowsze region, for example.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, products such as Dresden Christmas stollen or Black Forest ham are not only known beyond Europe’s borders, but their very names represent a promise of quality on which consumers can rely. Not only do consumers benefit from the mark of quality, but so do the producers, who, if anything, might not survive at all in the marketplace without the protection of certification. For this reason, I am convinced that the introduction of the quality mark 20 years ago has achieved its objective and promoted traditional and regional foodstuff products. I therefore agree with the rapporteur and would like to add my thanks for the addition of further quality marks, which are necessary, after all. I would like to offer my thanks once again for the initiative to simplify the existing certification processes.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, without a doubt, the European Union is to be highly commended for the help it has been giving for a long time now to the poorest countries in the world. But things change and countries change, and thankfully some of those countries are becoming rich, some of them richer than countries in Europe. Therefore, it is right and proper that we review the development aid we give them. However, I voted with the committee and against my own group in relation to Section 2(4) because I think that more time should be given to some of the countries in the ACT to reach the arrangement mentioned. That aside, I think we have done a good job.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report, which I regard as being of paramount importance, because it stipulates for the first time a regulation on the European Social Entrepreneurship Fund. After the Commission’s statement launching this fund as part of the innovation project, I think that, given the social vulnerabilities in the European Union, it is time for this fund to address the needs of practically almost everyone and not only of vulnerable, excluded and socially disadvantaged people, but of other people too.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I believe that the regulation ought to have encouraged cross-border cooperation in the use of the fund. With regard to the rules on using the profits, they ought to have been made much clearer because, in the spirit of social investment in social undertakings, I believe that profits need to be reinvested for the same purpose as initial capital.</p>

I believe that, with regard to SMEs, it is time for us to attempt, as part of the EU 2020 strategy, to have a very clear European framework and a method for supervising venture funds because they explain, if you like, the situation of the European Union’s financial market.</p>

The same applies, in particular, to financial dealings. Many people say that friendship stops when it comes to money. There are a number of things in the European Union – as the speaker before me said – that are not in working order. I found the vote on this difficult. On the other hand, I have heard that the rapporteur and the competent committee are seeking not only to consult with the Commission, but also to hold intense discussions in order to put an end to these irregularities at long last. I could also say something polemic with respect to the most recent financial crisis. It was not the tradespeople who brought the world to the edge of ruin; it was the elite of this world in finance.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I consider that a regulation on the European venture capital funds is of paramount importance in a Union which has the ambition of becoming the most innovative economy in the world. This regulation contributes to that end. By laying down uniform rules, it is instrumental for the good functioning of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="en">This regulation draws a proportional balance between the needs of our economies and macro-economic prudence.

Some of the amendments I wish to be discussed further include a clear definition of ‘a threat of serious deterioration’ for the activation of a safeguard clause on bananas, and of ‘stabilisation mechanism’ as well. They also include the Commission’s room for manoeuvre in its application for Parliament’s involvement in possible investigations, and the inclusion of additional socio-economic indicators on top of Colombian and Peruvian export and import statistics for monitoring the effect of the FTA.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the association agreement between the EU and Central America undoubtedly offers a good deal for both partners, and I fully support it. The opening of markets in industry, agricultural services, government procurement and investment goes further than the commitments undertaken with the World Trade Organisation and surpasses the existing EUR 12 billion trade relationship.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I, for one, believe the bilateral safeguard clause must exist along with the agreement to prevent injury or threat thereof to the EU banana industry, I also believe that, in its current form, it presents a number of problems. These include: the involvement of the European Parliament in initiating an investigation in the framework of the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism; the lack of a clear definition of ‘threat of serious deterioration’ for activation of the clause; the additional further socio-economic indicators of top Colombian and Peruvian exports; and import statistics for monitoring the effects of the FTA.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, one could smirk and say that in our modern world, too, absolutely everything needs to be regulated. Of course, I do think it important that we should not concern ourselves solely with the protection of works in which everything is known from a copyright point of view. On the contrary, it is also important to consider cases in which authors and creators are no longer known, for whatever reason. Our European culture is extremely diverse, something which is also boosted by the digitisation of orphan works. Attention needs to be paid, however, to ensuring that there is proper checking of whether a work is actually an orphan work, whether the creator or author really is not known. Otherwise, we run the risk of copyright being undercut as the basis for the motivation to create new works. I therefore advocate the creation of a comprehensive regulatory framework so that exactly that does not happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group strongly supports the joint text on Syria. Each day, the news about the situation in Syria worsens as the violence escalates and the conflict descends further into civil war.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was reported that, last month alone, 5 000 Syrians were killed, making it the deadliest month of the conflict so far. According to activist groups, this has pushed the overall death toll up to 26 000 and, what is more, the violence seen in Syria last month sadly shows no sign of stopping, as Assad-loyal, mainly Alawite-led forces continue to rely on air power and heavy weaponry to suppress the rebellion, and Iran continues to arm the Syrian regime with military equipment and weapons flown through Iraqi airspace. Sadly, there are now also allegations of atrocities being carried out by the rebel forces and, if they are true, that must also be investigated, and there can be no climate of impunity for anybody carrying out atrocities on either side of the conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ECR extends solidarity to the Syrian people who are in desperate need, now more than ever, of significant humanitarian assistance as a result of this ongoing violence. Whilst the group resolution calls for a peaceful solution to be found in order to facilitate a political transition, without President al-Assad, towards a more stable and democratic Syria, speaking personally, I would like to find ways of establishing a limited no-fly zone in the border regions and some kind of escape corridors, in order to create a sanctuary for refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again, speaking personally, I call on the UN Security Council to refer all those responsible for war crimes to the International Criminal Court, and for Russia and China to lift their veto in the Security Council on tougher sanctions against the Ba’athist Syrian regime.</p>

Wars today are no longer waged on battlefields between the armies of two clearly distinct states, pennants streaming: the biggest single victim in today’s wars is always the civilian.

Syria was, for decades, a stable partner for the West, but also for its neighbours. The instability that is now arising in Syria poses an eminent risk, especially for the neighbouring countries, and especially for Israel. The West thus cannot act the way it did in Libya or Egypt. The situation in Syria is considerably more dangerous for the entire region. The question that must first be asked is: what is Saudi Arabia doing? Why is the West watching on as fundamentalist Muslims in Syria massacre Alawis and Christians? That is the first thing to do.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, people across the world are watching the situation in Syria with horror and empathy for the plight of the Syrian people. What began as a popular uprising against Assad has descended into a civil war with religious, ethnic and sectarian characteristics. Unfortunately, it is increasingly the arena for a regional and international proxy war. On the one side is the brutal Assad regime, backed up by Iran and Russia. On the other side is an array of anti-Assad, often ethnically-based and divided opposition forces. Many of these are bankrolled and aided militarily by some of the most reactionary Arab states and Turkey, together with Western imperialism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, they do not provide a way forward for the Syrian people. Any military intervention would worsen the situation. It would not be taken in the interests of the Syrian people or peace and it could accelerate the process of Balkanisation and potentially inflame the whole region.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, a resolution on Syria is quite simply a moral obligation. Even though this will not affect the actual situation, it will draw the attention of the entire civilised world to what is happening in Syria, to the plight of thousands of refugees and the extent of human suffering caused by the deaths of those who have been killed, as well as to those who are in the thick of the conflict. At the same time, the use of the military against civilians is something that has to be condemned, and which has caused an exodus of refugees. The lack of agreement within the UN Security Council, and particularly the position of China and Russia, makes this a situation that is very difficult to resolve politically. We therefore call on these countries to take part in an international response capable of bringing about a radical change in the situation in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another issue, one which we do not often discus, relates to the risks associated with the huge stockpiles of chemical weapons. Institutions investigating the situation in Syria have been flagging this up. If adequate safeguards are not maintained in relation to these weapons, there could be an enormous humanitarian catastrophe in the region.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group is deeply concerned about the integrity of the justice system in Russia. One of the most high profile cases in the past decade has been that of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Many legal experts and human rights organisations have condemned the charges against him as politically motivated, especially with regard to his second trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">But with specific reference to the mention in the text of the resolution of the reduction of Platon Lebedev’s prison sentence by three years, it is important for the House to note that this has been appealed by the prosecutors. The verdict, due on 21 September 2012, will be crucial in determining whether the courts respect the country’s constitutional and international obligations or whether instructions from the executive will prevail.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to point out that the Supreme Court has referred the appeal by Khodorkovsky and Lebedev back to the Moscow City Court, despite a plea by the defence to consider the appeal on its own merits and not to send it back to the Moscow court, whose judicial independence is highly questionable.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unacceptable, in the view of the ECR Group, that political prisoners still exist in Member States of the Council of Europe. I am thinking here not only of Russia but also of neighbouring Ukraine, in particular, the case of Yulia Tymoshenko. The recent disproportionate sentencing of the punk group Pussy Riot is also the latest in a string of selective justice cases that include the Russian Supreme Court’s prohibition on peaceful Falun Gong practitioners practising their beliefs. Russia is, of course, a very great country and a strategic partner, but it seems to be going backwards as far as democracy and human rights are concerned.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the most recent events in Russia are unfortunate examples of how culture and religion are abused in the context of the political game. Unfortunately, this is not the first case, and it will not be the last: we, of course, remember the murders of Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, Magnitsky and other journalists, which have still not been investigated.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A breach of religious peace is always a crime, and in other countries, too, it carries a penalty. What is most problematic about Russia, however, is the high-handed way in which the issue was dealt with there. Since the case, the Russian Duma has even enacted new laws against citizens who express their opinions. Apart from the matter of the individual destinies of people, the greatest concern is how freedom of speech will be safeguarded in Russia in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Does Europe intend just to stand by and do nothing? Safeguarding human rights and the rule of law must be an essential component in a democratic society. We in Europe must do all we can to promote freedom of speech and democracy everywhere, including Russia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, over the past few years, we have been hearing more and more about abuses of the Russian judicial system. This has been evidenced even by the huge number of cases submitted to the European Court of Human Rights. Of particular note are instances of interference by the judiciary in political matters, on which, of course, it should be completely independent. I would draw attention to the fact that the Russian constitution guarantees its citizens a full range of rights and liberties. These activities have brought about a dramatic fall in the trust that people have in the legal system and have reduced the independence of the judiciary. It is worrying to see legal restrictions being placed on freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and the imposition of stiff penalties in cases of contravention of these restrictions.</p>

Russia and the Russian people are capable of themselves developing a state under the rule of law and at a speed and with the focuses that they themselves choose. No country, especially one the size of Russia, would accept that from outside. The United States, similarly, would not accept a comparable imposition.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the time being, I would like to concentrate on the conviction of the band Pussy Riot. I have some sympathy for the Russians’ sensitive reaction to actions of this kind in Moscow’s largest and most important church, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, in which I, too, have prayed. If these women had done the same thing in a mosque in Saudi Arabia or in Pakistan, they would have been sentenced to death. No parliament would react to that. This is therefore a cheap form of anti-Russian propaganda that is being used here, and I must protest against the attempt being made here to force Europe into conflict with Russia.</p>

I regard this banking union, which was proposed by the President of the Commission yesterday, as downright laughable. The subsequent debate has shown that most Members believe that this supervision of banking represents financial supervision. That is absolutely wrong. It is something completely different.</p>
      <p sl="de">This supervision of banking proposed by the President of the Commission will not make it possible to monitor any finance and investment houses such as Goldman Sachs, nor to remove any financial products from the market. It will make it possible to supervise the activities of a few small banks, but no more than that. This supervision will not enable us to tackle the financial problems that various financial institutions got us into, in particular Goldman Sachs, with its consultancy services via Mario Draghi in Greece. That is why what is being proposed here is downright laughable. It is yet another attempt to use the crisis to create a political union, which is then to be imposed on Europe’s citizens – a kind of birth of a state through the crisis. That is something that I categorically reject.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, yesterday’s speech by Mr Barroso, along with our work on the draft resolution, constitute approval for plans to create a banking union. In fact, the crisis in the euro area is speeding up this process. However the presentation of the resolution and the legal basis to which reference was made indicate that this is meant only for members of the euro area. All European Union Member States should, of course, have the right, if they want, to join this banking union. After all, there is 90% external capital in Hungarian banks and about 70% in Polish banks, which includes funds from banks in European Union Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposal concerning closer cooperation for countries that are outside the euro area constitutes a second category of membership in the banking union, with obligations but without the possibility of influencing decisions, with serious consequences for the country concerned and for savings, deposits, guarantees for these deposits and any rescue funds. This is a direct path to a two-speed European Union, and we would not want to agree to this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am actually very pleased that we have made progress in this regard. These proposals first emerged back in June and I think we are making good and satisfactory progress which will help us to get out of this recession and, more importantly, put proper controls in all banks in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I come from a small country, and from my experience, I would never again trust banks in my country if it was left up to the authorities within the State to supervise them totally. Central authority at European level is far better; it is more objective and, certainly, the ‘palsy-walsy’ situation which we saw in Ireland was partly responsible for leading us into the terrible position we are now in.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is to be welcomed, and the sooner it happens – and the more banks that are under the supervisory control of the ECB – the better. Finally I just want to thank President Draghi for the courage, the vision and the decisions he has taken since he came into office. He has been a breath of fresh air.</p>

As a Portuguese and a European, a closer relationship between the European Union and Brazil is extremely important to me and I am pleased that this is not restricted to trade, but also encompasses scientific and technological cooperation. This is essential, considering Brazil’s increasing role on the world stage. In this regard, I must also emphasise the Portuguese language’s strategic role as a direct means of communication between the two sides of the Atlantic, strengthening a relationship that we want to be fruitful and advantageous for both parties. The European institutions would function better if they had greater ability to communicate externally in their languages.

As, in my view, there is a danger that the EU could end up providing a majority of the funding in, above all, the planned construction of joint research centres, given that the level of the Algerian economy is still far beneath that of the EU, I abstained from the vote.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Managing information that is considered classified is inevitably complex, requiring caution and discretion and a strict notion of who can access it and how they can use it. This sensitivity is aggravated when the information has to pass between institutions which, by their nature, have very different structures and ways of operating. This is the case with Parliament and the Council. Together, they should be capable of ensuring that information considered classified remains that way, whilst simultaneously ensuring that MEPs’ right to information is not restricted in an inappropriate and disproportionate way.

The Council has been criticised for hiding information from Parliament. Obviously, it is not possible for everyone to have access to everything. We understand that there may be ‘top secret’ confidential information that should not be available to the general public or to MEPs. However, Parliament must have the ability to supervise the EU institutions.

The idea was suggested of turning the Lisbon strategy into the EU 2020 strategy, which would emphasise competitiveness and a reduction in the administrative burden through smart regulation to ensure that markets work for people. The most important thing now is to ensure that activities are stepped up. It is important to update the 2003 interinstitutional agreement, taking into account the legislative environment that has come about following ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. It is also necessary to stress the need for action in the areas of subsidiarity checks by national parliaments and when it comes to impact assessments conducted by Parliament and the Council. Finally, the functioning of existing legislation needs to be examined.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The majority of the Commission’s proposals have been adopted by national parliaments without any significant discussions taking place about subsidiarity. The only proper debates about the way to interpret subsidiarity have taken place between Parliament and the Council, ending up with a suitable balance being found between the responsibilities of the EU and those of Member States. In practical terms, it can be seen that implementing EU legislation is still a problem nationally, and I think that better communication between national parliaments and the European Parliament could improve this situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report is also important because it touches on a number of issues which are of particular interest to Parliament. I would like to mention among these the need to revise the interinstitutional agreement on better law making, adopting legislation on SMEs and, last but not least, making further improvements for better law making.</p>

      <p sl="it">This is a decent report throughout, from its basic structure onwards. Moreover, the Treaty of Lisbon set out a system of close integration between national and local parliaments according to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which now – if such a thing is possible – take on even greater significance given the tension that Europe’s governance structure is subject to in view of the crisis. Bearing this in mind, I especially agree with the proposals and observations set out in paragraphs 7, 9, 11 and 13. Regarding minimising regulatory burdens, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), I think that the principle is as widely held as it has turned out to be difficult to apply in reality. It is now hard not to see over-regulation as the main thing holding back the development of dynamic economies. The Commission’s ‘tailor-made’ doctrine could probably be of help here, as – even more so – could the general approach based on the concrete proposals set out in paragraphs 22 to 28. In any case, the key to achieving the goals of the interinstitutional agreement is a shared experimental approach and a shared rigorous review and revision process.</p>

It aims to consolidate efforts in better law making, simplify EU law and reduce administrative and regulatory burdens, while promoting a process of evidence-based policy making, particularly through impact assessments and ex post controls. Only in this way can we ensure that EU law is consistent with its objectives and able to make an effective contribution to meeting the approaching competitiveness and growth challenges. I equally welcome the fact that national parliaments will be more closely involved in the European legislative process with regard to scrutinising legislative proposals in the light of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.

      <p sl="pt">I will today repeat the words that I have used before on this same subject. ‘I fully support the ongoing effort to develop legislation for Europeans that is simple, transparent and understandable. Despite well-intentioned declarations, rigorous studies and clear reports from numerous institutions, the truth is that European legislation continues to suffer from the ills that are frequently pointed out: excessive volume, unsuitable complexity, unintelligibility, and a string of remissions. This fact not only distances Europeans from decisions made at European level, it also feeds the debate – not always very reasonable or rigorous – regarding European intrusion into matters on which it would not pass judgment or legislate if there were more careful compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality’. Yesterday, we heard President Barroso talking about strengthening democracy and praising the principle of subsidiarity. I heard him state that not everything can be a priority. He is correct. We should be capable of producing less, but better, legislation because that is the only way we will serve European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report by Sajjad Karim we are discussing addresses the content of the 18th report on better legislation – Application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (2010). As a colegislating body, Parliament wants the European Union to produce the best legislation in the world. To achieve smart and simplified EU law, a timely report on implementing this agreement has been drafted. The 2003 interinstitutional agreement on better law making is currently being revised to adapt it to the legislative procedures that came into force with the Treaty of Lisbon. One aspect that needs to be resolved is to urge national institutions involved in law making to ensure that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are applied under the terms of Protocol No 2 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. I welcome the closer involvement of the national parliaments in the European legislative process with regard to implementing the proposals related to these principles.

      <p sl="pt">This report aims to evaluate the smart regulation agenda. According to President Barroso’s political guidelines, it aims for competitiveness and less administrative burden through smart regulation to make markets work for people. In other words, markets and their free operation are prioritised to benefit economic and financial groups. When it comes to individuals, to Europe’s workers and peoples, they suffer the full impact of an unprecedented regression in civilisation caused by EU policies backed by its legislation. We must mention that the EU’s increased legislative burden results from the encroachment on the Member States’ sovereignty, which is undemocratic because their wishes and participation are ignored and because it is contrary to their interests. The elected bodies in Member States, which are closer to citizens and more closely controlled by them, are losing their power, especially national parliaments. Today, these are mere spectators to the EU legislative process (as the card procedures for scrutinising the principle of subsidiarity demonstrate), which covers decisive areas of their daily business and their collective duties.</p>

By reducing the regulatory burden that businesses face, we can stimulate the economic recovery that Europe so desperately needs. I strongly welcome the approach to regulation outlined in this report. Better law making will, amongst other things, see SMEs being supported in their compliance with regulation, allowing them the necessary flexibility to compete with the economies of scale associated with large businesses. I hope this report will also lead to better impact assessments of proposed European legislation, so that law makers have the necessary evidence base to make pragmatic decisions. I hope, too, that the use of ‘regulatory offsetting’ will encourage a situation where ineffective or obsolete regulation is removed. This approach to better law making has my full support.</p>

Parliament emphasises that subsidiarity, in this context, not only applies to the relationship between the EU and its Member States, but encompasses as well the regional and local levels; urges the Commission to improve and regularise the statements which justify its legislative initiatives on the grounds of subsidiarity; recalls that EU administrative law should be adjusted and simplified in order to reduce administrative and regulatory costs; states that, in this context, the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality should be applied accordingly.</p>

I believe that the only way for us to effectively cooperate at both Member State and institutional level is within the framework of appropriate and clear laws. I particularly support ideas that are against pushing the administrative burdens of citizens and SMEs even higher. Smart regulation must include the possibility to reduce, if necessary, the number of aspects of the transposition and application of legislation that were not entirely successful so far, and attempt to accomplish them by other means. As a democratically elected body, the European Parliament can do much in this regard through its consultations with the citizens and its continuous contact with the national parliaments. The relaying of information and mutual communication must be given a central role.

Better legislation also means institutional respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, which are basic principles of the EU Treaties and a guarantee of national and popular sovereignty. Faced with opinions from national parliaments in which justifications for subsidiarity are sometimes inadequate or absent, I welcome the closer involvement of national parliaments in the European legislative process, particularly with regard to scrutinising legislative proposals in the light of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, because this is consonant with the legitimate appeal against the Commission and the Council made by national parliaments for the first time on 22 May 2012 through the ‘yellow card’ procedure on the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.

The aim of such a macro-regional strategy and a related action plan is to better coordinate and to create synergies between all EU policies that affect this area, particularly those relating to marine energy, maritime industries, tourism, employment opportunities for young people in the maritime sector, and the sustainable exploitation of maritime resources. The aim should be to provide a new impetus to coastal areas and their hinterlands. I would point out that Dublin Port welcomed over 85 cruise ships in 2011, worth an estimated EUR 50 million to the city’s economy, as well as hosting the ‘Tall Ships’ event this August. Coming from a Member State that does not have a direct land link to mainland Europe, I particularly welcome the call on the EU to invest in ‘motorways of the seas’.

The Atlantic area is a dynamic maritime area that forms the Western approach to the EU, and is therefore of strategic importance for transatlantic transport.

Firstly, as an MEP from a country facing the Atlantic, where much of its history has played out and some of its economic activity takes place, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Alain Cadec, for his work. The Atlantic area is a region with huge potential, where the most diverse activities take place: tourism, fishing, renewable energy, transport, etc. As a marine environment, it is obviously fragile and needs to be protected; as an outlying area, it requires special attention; and, as the western approach to the EU, it has a strategic position. I therefore welcome the drafting of this Atlantic strategy, with a macro-regional approach, that brings together different synergies and will boost socio-economic development across the region.

We disagree with the proposals to create a European coastguard service and the Single European Sky, which undermines national control of airspace and aims to pave the way towards liberalising the aviation sector.

Regional policy aims to help the most underdeveloped regions and reduce disparities. However, the crisis has not spared our regions and the members of the UMP in the European Parliament have taken action in favour of a fairer distribution of funding. Thanks to this road map, we will have to be able to contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of maritime regions by focusing efforts on strategic sectors: marine energies, shipbuilding industries, sustainable fishing and tourism.

This regulation offers duty free access to the EU market. Unfortunately, several countries have neither taken the necessary steps towards ratification of an EPA nor concluded comprehensive regional negotiations and the European Commission has therefore proposed that, as of 1 January 2014, those countries should be removed from the list of beneficiaries of this provision. Seventeen countries have not yet proceeded with their ratification process and, according to the European Commission, such a situation is not compatible with WTO rules. Essentially, it is proposed that measures should be taken that would increase the momentum of negotiations, but such agreements are difficult in nature and are hard to implement in rigid timeframes, so the proposed deadline (by 2014) is too short.

      <p sl="en">There is a moral imperative as well as an EU treaty obligation on Europe to agree fair and development-friendly economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with its African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) partners. Europe must take account of the different needs and levels of development in ACP countries and regions. It should not rush its partners into signing unsatisfactory EPAs before all contentious issues are resolved. The ACP countries affected by the Commission’s proposal to abolish, from 2014, duty-free and quota-free access to EU markets, need a realistic timeframe to agree and ratify fair EPAs. The abolition of such access from 2014 would be detrimental for these countries, particularly for those that would not benefit under the ‘Everything But Arms’ market access arrangements. I therefore support a two-year extension, i.e. from 2014 to 2016, during which these ACP countries should continue to benefit from unlimited preferential access to EU markets. This extension should provide a realistic timeframe to work towards development-friendly EPAs that are fair to both ACP and non-ACP countries alike.</p>

These preferences are, in theory, valid until 2014, the date initially planned for the entry into force of the economic partnership agreements concluded with the European Union. However, some ACP countries have expressed a desire to be able to take advantage of these measures for longer before the subsequent conclusion of these agreements. By giving the green light to prolonging trade preferences for ACP countries until 2016, the European Union is allowing numerous ACP countries to negotiate without the pressure of fair economic partnership agreements.</p>

In accordance with World Trade Organisation rules, the preferential treatment that the European Union granted to the countries with which it established cooperation agreements ended in 2007. The Cotonou Agreement was concluded in 2008 and provides support to the developing countries under specified rules. After concluding negotiations with half of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, the EU approved a new regulation exempting them from paying duty and quotas, in the expectation that they would all sign the new agreement. However, around 18 countries have not gone on to conclude the agreements. It is therefore imperative to force these countries to conclude the cooperation agreements with the EU as soon as possible. I agree with the Commission proposal to demand that the new agreements be signed by 1 January 2014, as we cannot continue with temporary measures that disadvantage third parties.</p>

These are nothing more than free trade agreements between the EU and ACP countries, which could have disastrous consequences for the fragile and undiversified economies of these countries, opening the door to the colonisation of their markets and further economic dependence and subordination. Our group proposed to simply reject the proposal which, regrettably, was not accepted by the majority of Parliament. The agreement between the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe succeeded in postponing for two years the end of the trade preferences granted to these countries. However, the idea behind this postponement (which was still a defeat for the Commission, which opposed it with the fundamentalism we have come to expect in this area) is very clear: to give the countries more time to conclude the agreements. That is, to leave the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of the ACP countries. This is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="it">In the distant days of June 2000, a framework cooperation agreement between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States was signed in Cotonou, the capital of Benin. The goal of that agreement was to facilitate economic, social and cultural development in these areas, to be achieved in various areas and via different instruments. One of the measures adopted provided that, as of 1 January 2008, a number of products from some of these countries could enjoy particular trade advantages. However, everything was tied to compliance with specific criteria, which not all the states in question were capable of living up to. Therefore, the Commission rightly decided to remove from the agreement those countries who did not want to comply with the regulations: for once, I cannot disagree with this decision by the Commission. Respect for agreements and guarantees should be the minimum that is demanded from partner countries when such agreements are made.

I believe that the date of 1 January 2014 set by the Commission for ratifying the EPAs is too soon, since the specific characteristics of these countries must be considered. Such an example is Haiti, which is still suffering the consequences of the 2010 earthquake, and regions of Africa where regional integration and stable relationships between countries sometimes do not exist.

      <p sl="hu">Today, the European Parliament took an important step towards strengthening the position of EU Member States in relation to major energy exporters and mitigating their vulnerability. According to the document adopted at today’s plenary session, Member States will, in future, engage in more extensive information exchange about intergovernmental agreements on energy supply. The exchange of information will facilitate the coordination of the actions of EU governments against major energy exporters, as a result of which Member States will be able to obtain energy under more favourable conditions. The majority of EU Member States ensure their long-term energy supply through intergovernmental agreements with third countries. Yet, in their negotiations concerning energy supply, they do not make use of the circumstance that the European Union, with its population of 500 million, is the world’s largest energy market. The guarantee for the security of EU energy supply and more favourable energy prices lies in closer cooperation between Member States, as well as common action. Through knowledge of the effective intergovernmental agreements and the coordination of negotiation strategies, Member States can attain a better bargaining position with major energy exporters, and can thus obtain energy at more favourable prices. The strengthening of the bargaining positions of Member States is a current issue for Hungary as well, as the country’s long-term gas supply agreement expires in 2015. In order to ensure the secure energy supply and industrial competitiveness of my home country, it is crucial that we manage to extend our gas supply agreement under favourable conditions.

However, given the fact that EU Member States still import over 60% of gas and over 80% of oil, many EU Member States are vulnerable in this respect. The gas supply crisis of 2009 demonstrated the weak points and vulnerability of the EU gas supply system.

I voted for this report, as I believe that it is crucial to facilitate compliance with the EU’s internal market rules and to encourage Member States to take necessary steps to eliminate incompatibilities identified in the IGAs with third countries in the field of energy in order to secure the proper functioning and security of the internal energy market in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="it">As it stands, the management of intergovernmental agreements between individual Member States and third countries is more complex than ever before. Not only do we not know their exact number, but since there is no obligation to inform the Commission and the other Member States, we find ourselves faced with agreements that contradict or are incompatible with EU legislation on the energy market. Consequently, a set of regulations that brings about a clear break with the past seems equally urgent. Hence, legislation should require final agreements to be notified to the Commission and made subject to its approval. Moreover, it would be a good idea if the Commission were to be granted an ex ante compliance check, thus avoiding any time and resources being wasted. Unfortunately, however, this approach – which is the only option that is really compatible with the very idea of the EU – is once again being steamrollered by the interests of the Member States and their desire to act freely in delicate areas like the energy sector. It is nevertheless regrettable to note that the moderate and conservative forces of this House have also taken the same position, while they should always seek to ensure that EU interests take precedence.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Stable and secure energy supplies are crucial for competitiveness, growth, the sustainability of European companies and reducing the bills that citizens pay. Energy security also is of great significance for the EU’s strategic interests. The best way to ensure the reliability of energy supplies is via a functioning internal energy market and reduced external dependence, as the President of the Commission made clear in his State of the Union 2012 Address. The EU currently imports over 60% of its gas and over 80% of its oil. This tendency is increasing and is unsustainable. Accordingly, in addition to the need to reduce energy dependence, it is also crucial to diversify sources of energy supply. Intergovernmental agreements can therefore support the EU’s goal, extending the supply sources to the Black Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean region and Central Asia.</p>

      <p sl="pt">EU Member States are among the most dependent on other countries for their energy needs. We actually import over 60% of the gas and over 80% of the oil we consume, and this tendency is increasing due to citizens living more comfortably, regardless of the investments being made in renewable energy. It is therefore crucial to ensure secure supplies. Currently, each Member State has its own bilateral agreements for supplying these products, the contents of which are unknown to other Member States. This means that prices vary significantly from country to country, with enormous losses for consumers. Conscious of this situation, in its 2011 conclusions, the Council suggested that the Commission present a proposal to remedy this problem. We all agree that we would obtain significant cost reductions if the EU negotiated the supply of these products centrally. It is therefore necessary for Member States to provide copies of the contracts they hold. I voted for this report, as I believe that we cannot waste this golden opportunity to move forward into the future, otherwise we could be accused of not knowing how to manage the EU’s resources.</p>

It is in the interest of the EU and the Member States to manage the external energy relations though intergovernmental agreements and to leverage the negotiating power of the Member States and its vast internal market through the exchange of information and best practices between Member States and the Commission.

      <p sl="fr">Until now, the number of intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of energy is unknown, as Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of such agreements. According to the Commission, Member States are becoming increasingly obliged to accept regulatory concessions, which is incompatible with European law on the matter. In addition, as the Commission does not know exactly how much energy is being imported, it cannot provide for market fluctuations or the means to alleviate them. Consequently, the Commission has proposed to put in place an information exchange mechanism with regard to energy agreements with third countries. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tried to strengthen the proposal by allowing the Commission to have access to agreements before they are signed, in order to be able to advise Member States on their compatibility with the law. Such a measure would also strengthen transparency. The Member States did not want this, and the rapporteur did not seem to care, preferring a bad agreement to no agreement on the subject at all.

It is about exchanging information on agreements that are likely to have an impact on the internal market for energy or on the security of our supply in order to better coordinate our external energy policy. Only intergovernmental agreements are concerned; agreements between commercial companies would not be subject to these provisions. This text achieves a good balance between the rights of Member States to negotiate independently and the need for the European Union to have a coherent and solid external energy policy. It is simply a question of ensuring that no agreement is signed that would run counter to the energy needs of the European Union. The most important point in the implementation of this agreement is to respect the confidentiality of such agreements; as the actors are fully aware of this issue, I am sure that the confidentiality of these issues will not be in danger.</p>

Knowledge of the effective intergovernmental agreements facilitates the coordination of the actions of EU governments, and Member States can thus obtain energy under more favourable conditions. The agreement adopted at first reading today represents an important step towards the coordination of negotiating strategies and the strengthening of Member States’ positions. If we were to adopt a more ambitious parliamentary proposal, on the other hand, we would violate the compromise between the EP and the Council, and would further delay the establishment of the legislative framework for information exchange. It is essential to the EU’s energy supply and competitiveness that we improve Member States’ bargaining positions as soon as possible, and I therefore voted for the approval of the agreement between the EP and the Council and the immediate establishment of the relevant legislative framework.</p>

The best way to ensure the reliability of energy supplies is via a functioning internal energy market. I therefore welcome this proposal’s aim of increasing the transparency of the IGAs concluded by the Member States in the field of energy and ensuring that Member States are aware of the compliance or non-compliance of the agreement with the internal market rules.

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this report. The EU imports over 60% of its gas and over 80% of its oil. This import tendency is increasing and makes us very vulnerable. Energy supply contracts are usually concluded between commercial entities, but there are some situations when intergovernmental agreements (IGA) are requested of an EU Member State. Sometimes, however, the aim of the third country is to bind an EU Member State to assure the commercial contract or to secure a monopolistic position in energy supplies via particular infrastructure. I believe that in order to avoid a breach of internal market rules in the field of energy, we must enhance our internal EU cooperation regarding IGAs. We know that Gazprom does not always play by the rules and the Russian Federation uses political pressure to try to get what it wants. This has recently taken place in Bulgaria.

Although measures proposed in this report are not obligatory, I urge the Member States to show political will and solidarity and follow this proposal. Our internal market is almost fully dependent on the imports from third countries, hence, we need a system to govern this. And, as the report states, such transparency would also be of benefit in achieving both closer intra-Union cooperation in the field of external energy relations and the Union’s long-term policy objectives relating to energy, climate and security of energy supply.</p>

Nevertheless, external vulnerabilities remain as the EU imports over 60% of its gas and over 80% of its oil. This import tendency is increasing.

The bills produced by energy companies are so complex that they are practically impossible to compare.

I consider this hard-won agreement the first legislative step towards creating a common external energy policy of the EU. The compromise does not adhere to the Commission’s proposal and does not meet Parliament’s expectations. Even so, an opportunity has been created for Europe-wide coordination of energy relations with third countries to monitor compliance with European legislation. This establishes legal predictability and stability for investors and the operation of energy infrastructures created with the involvement of third countries. The compromise limits the Commission’s role in negotiations with third countries to that of an observer who may, however, offer advice and assess the agreements’ compliance with European law, when the countries expressly request this. The positive example of the European Commission’s involvement in last year’s negotiations between Poland and Gazprom is encouraging for the Member States from East Europe. The opinion that a common EU agreement on energy supplies from third countries is the ideal solution for securing energy supplies, reducing market fragmentation, increasing competition and ensuring fair energy prices is gaining increasing traction.

It is important for the European Commission to have information about the prices paid by Member States for oil and gas. It is important for the EU to try, using the experience of certain countries, to help other countries obtain better conditions in their gas contracts. There are many positive examples relating to such activities, for example, the negotiations for a gas contract between Poland and Gazprom.

      <p sl="fr">As you know, I am particularly committed to products from our regions and that is why I supported this text, which aims to better protect them. This regulation provides for a system of protected designations of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indications (PGI). This will allow us to better protect the producers of products linked to a geographical area. A ‘traditional speciality guaranteed’ (TSG) label will be put in place. Producers will be able to obtain this label once they prove that the product has been used on the internal market for a period of at least 30 years, as opposed to the current threshold of 25 years. This label will allow us to safeguard not only traditional production methods but also recipes.</p>

Producers have little familiarity with existing quality schemes – such as the protected designation of origin scheme, for products from certain areas produced by local methods; the protected geographical indication scheme, for articles with strong links to a particular district; and the traditional speciality guaranteed scheme, which emphasises the traditional character of the foodstuff – and each one is a complex and lengthy process.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the issue of food quality is very relevant for consumers as it encourages the demand for high-quality products, both on the internal and international markets. The EU applies its own food quality policy measures: labels and quality schemes have been introduced which focus on products’ high value characteristics and regional specificities. Currently, new proposals have been presented on quality and marketing standards, which are concerned with quality assurance and the operation of national and private certification schemes. Priorities include the simplification and development of the current schemes, as well as the addition of new quality terms. The main goal of all the amendments presented is to achieve consistency with the other amendments that depart from the limitation to processed foods only.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Improving the food certification and labelling scheme should bring great benefits to regions with particularly large numbers of local specialist products. Setting clear definitions may help in better understanding of the whole production process, which would seem to be of special importance for producers. Looking just at the economic aspect of this decision, the simplification of quality assurance systems for agricultural products and the resulting reduction in the time needed to certify regional and organic foods could bring considerable benefits to regions with a high concentration of such products, as well as giving them greater recognition and maintaining the high quality of these products.

      <p sl="ro">The quality and safety of food rely upon the efforts of all those involved in the complex chain which includes agricultural production, processing, transport and consumption. A variety of control procedures and mechanisms need to be carried out along the food chain to ensure that the food which arrives on the consumer’s table is edible and that the risk of contamination is kept to a minimum. This will make the population healthier as a result of the benefits provided by safe and healthy food. However, there is no such thing as zero risk when it comes to food, and we must realise that even the best legislation and best control systems cannot protect us entirely against those with evil intentions. The best way in which we can practise food safety is for us to be well informed about the basic principles of producing food and handling it safely at home.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation because I believe it makes a significant contribution to, and helps complete, the rural development policy and the market and income support policies of the common agricultural policy (CAP). The quality and diversity of the European Union’s agricultural, fisheries and aquaculture production is one of its strengths, giving a competitive advantage to producers and making a major contribution to its cultural and gastronomic heritage. Citizens and consumers in the Union increasingly demand quality as well as traditional products. They are also concerned to maintain the diversity of agricultural production. This generates a demand for agricultural products or foodstuffs with identifiable specific characteristics, in particular, linked to their geographical origin. This regulation establishes quality schemes which provide the basis for the identification and protection of names that indicate or describe in particular agricultural products. The current quality schemes are: protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI), traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG), organic farming and outermost regions. The proposal as re-worked by Parliament is an excellent and commendable legal framework.</p>

We currently have protected designations of origin (PDOs) and protected geographical indications (PGIs) that are used to protect and enhance the quality of regional products with specific characteristics. In Sweden and Scandinavia, we are not particularly good at using these designations in the way that they are used in southern Europe (for example, Parma ham, Parmesan, etc.). The new proposal is more comprehensive and aims to introduce more categories and labelling, for example, food from Arctic regions, mountain areas, etc. This may also result in us having more uniform labelling that can be used throughout Europe and that could help to increase Swedish food exports as set out in the concept of Sweden – the new culinary nation. Fewer labels, which consumers trust and recognise, will make it easier for them to make an informed choice. The proposal also aims to ease the administrative burden and reduce red tape, something of which I take a very positive view.</p>

      <p sl="it">The quality package proposed by the Commission aims to establish a coherent legal framework for the EU’s policy on agricultural product quality. The proposal is, overall, worthy of support, thanks especially to the changes and amendments made by this House. Specifically, it is of the utmost importance to recognise the role, importance and responsibilities of producer groups, which can and must play a crucial role in product protection and marketing according to the established standards, thereby limiting the risks of abuse or, even worse, counterfeiting, as far as possible. I feel compelled, in particular, to highlight the changes made regarding the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) scheme. In this case, the Commission’s proposal seemed incongruous and detrimental, especially the idea to abolish TSGs without reservation of the name, forcing associations to repeat the whole bureaucratic process to get new recognition. Thanks to Parliament, good sense prevailed instead. We believe that the introduction of a simplified procedure for TSGs registered without reservation of the name can ensure their survival and, above all, extend safeguards and reduce counterfeiting, benefiting producers and consumers alike.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The demands of the market are diverse and are increasing all the time.

Faced with these new commercial challenges, the European farmer’s main asset is quality.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union offers the benefit of quality, which is attributable to an extremely high level of safety, guaranteed by current legislation, throughout the entire food chain, to which not only farmers but producers, too, have contributed. However, there are a few aspects capable of enhancing quality. I believe that it is the European Union’s duty to promote good-quality products, along with taking action to protect them globally. In this context, I think that tighter control must be exercised with regard to those organic products originating from third countries, thereby guaranteeing fair competition between organic products produced in Europe and those from third countries.</p>

Quality policy cannot be dissociated from the common agricultural policy as a whole, nor can it stand aside from such new challenges as the fight against climate change, the need to preserve biodiversity, energy supply issues, the development of bioenergies, animal welfare and water management in agriculture. Consumers’ growing requirements also need to be suitably incorporated in the future quality policy for agricultural products, not forgetting that quality matters to informed consumers when making choices. It is worth remembering, however, that agricultural product quality policy cannot be so demanding that it threatens small and medium-sized farmers, or the existence of traditional products that are typical of certain regions and whose manufacture cannot be subject to rules that are blindly uniform.

      <p sl="pt">This report, drafted by Ms García Pérez, concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on quality schemes for agricultural products. The European Union has always fought to increase the quality of its products, whether produced in the Member States or imported from third countries. Marketing standards aiming to simplify and harmonise have been approved by Parliament so as to guarantee premium products for European consumers. European agricultural production is not only of a high quality but it is also diverse. Therefore, product authenticity must be guaranteed through protected designations of origin. I therefore welcome the protection granted to mountain farming products. What is more, there will also be more transparency for producers and better information for consumers.

      <p sl="pt">The objective of this directive is to assist agricultural producers in communicating the characteristics and farming attributes, as well as the origin of agricultural products and foodstuffs, to buyers and consumers. The European Union has a policy of quality food products based on a system of certifications and labelling, in particular, protected designations of origin, protected geographical indications, the organic farming system and traditional specialities guaranteed. This is indisputably a way of bringing added value to regional products and traditional, local processes of production. However, it is not – and cannot be – the panacea for competitive pressure resulting from the liberalisation and deregulation of agricultural markets, of a ‘market-oriented CAP’. This system will not count for much in a context in which the income and purchasing power of the general population are being drastically reduced, and people are impoverished by so-called austerity measures. Moreover, doubts persist as to the conditions of access to these systems for small-scale, family-based and peasant farming, whether for bureaucratic or financial reasons. The rapporteur herself refers to these problems. We are doubtful that adequate, effective solutions have been found to address these problems.</p>

These two measures were passed during the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and we are pleased about that.

      <p sl="de">European agricultural products are among the highest quality in the whole world. One of the reasons for this is the tradition of agriculture and of optimising the resources used stretching back many years. In order for consumers to have certainty about where a product comes from and what it contains, there are Europe-wide quality labels such as the protected designation of origin (PDO), the protected geographical indication (PGI), the traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG), organic farming and the outermost regions. Given that it is still, to some extent, difficult for end consumers to negotiate the jungle of information on each product, I agree with the rapporteur that we need greater clarity, as well as a simplification. Above all, the regulation of quality under the ‘traditional speciality guaranteed’ label should apply to all processed products. I also agree with the rapporteur that there needs to be a clear definition of what ‘production steps’ means. The introduction of an EU-wide label that can only be borne by products that have gone though the same registration procedure, on the same terms, would be a welcome move. I therefore voted in favour of this report.</p>

Indeed, this text is also inspired by an own-initiative report of 2010 by Mr Scottà, a member of my party, on the quality of agricultural products. Our supermarkets are often flooded with products of dubious origin and we risk finding foods on our tables about which we know precious little: we therefore welcome greater protection and guarantees for the recognition of quality labels and for producers that meet specific requirements. The report also makes it possible to include additional, complementary information in labels, which can only be of help for consumers. Quality agriculture is a strength for all our territories so therefore let us defend and protect it vigorously, including – especially – at European level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Against. Unfortunately, in their desire to achieve a first reading agreement at any price, the other groups sacrificed too much during the negotiations. Most importantly, the Committee on Agriculture report contained a strong commitment to supply management of quality products by producer organisations, similar to what was agreed for certain dairy products on the Milk Package. The Council refused to compromise at all on this issue and, as a result, the EP negotiators consented to removal of this provision in return for a meaningless ‘political statement’ that the issue would be considered in CAP reform. Also, the trialogue agreement allows a ‘fast track’ procedure for third-country products to be marketed in the EU with quality marks, without going through an equivalent legislative procedure. As we had also failed to immediately achieve the ‘local farming and direct sales’ label, and given the disturbing precedent that this negotiation sets for future Committee on Agriculture codecision negotiations (with the Council refusing to compromise on essential points of policy for the EP), we signalled our opposition to a first reading agreement, preferring to go for second reading.</p>

      <p sl="en">Our group has submitted an amendment to the trialogue text – we are re-submitting the Agriculture Committee’s Amendment 87 on Article 42, which allows the Member States to establish rules allowing producer groups to adjust supply to demand of PGI and PDO products where such groups formally make a request. This is in no way a criticism of the excellent work done by the rapporteur, but reflects the political concerns our group has with the compromise. First, because we believe that volatility in the markets, seen most dramatically in the milk markets, has to be dealt with through a certain degree of supply management, to ensure that supply and demand do not go out of sync. Primarily, this shows our deep disapproval of the attitude of Council during trialogue negotiations. Amendment 87 was a key demand of the European Parliament, yet Council refused to even negotiate on the issue. This is unacceptable, especially under codecision, and represents a worryingly uncooperative attitude.

I think that quality schemes are able to complement and contribute to rural development policy as well as market and income support policies applied as part of the common agricultural policy (CAP), especially in areas where the farming sector is of greater economic importance, in particular, in disadvantaged areas. Operating quality schemes for producers, which reward them for their efforts to produce a diverse range of quality products, can benefit the rural economy, particularly in less favoured areas, in mountain areas and in the outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to avoid creating unfair competitive conditions, any producer, including third-country producers, should be able to use a registered name of a traditional speciality guaranteed, provided that the relevant product complies with the requirements of the relevant specification and the producer is covered by a system of controls.

At present, the Commission aims to respond to such requests within twelve months; under this new law, the registration time will be reduced to just six. This will benefit both farmers and consumers alike: a speedier and simpler registration process will encourage more food producers to register their products with quality label schemes, which will, in turn, allow consumers to make more informed choices about the food they buy. In addition to this, there is a new label recognising the value of foodstuffs produced in mountainous areas.

However, while such measures provide information to consumers, the fact remains that they fall within the framework of the policy on the liberalisation of the agricultural sector.

The experience of social cooperatives in getting people into work is an obvious example. However, legal forms aside, social innovation also arises from new methods of providing services and from the creation of new products to satisfy society’s new needs. The European institutions must therefore take coherent action, coordinating the provisions on social enterprises with those on innovation and social change. I believe that social enterprises should be supported: both because they can introduce new methods for providing services and action aimed at improving people’s quality of life, and because they promote the creation of new products to satisfy society’s new needs. It is also important to foster a more ‘subsidiarity friendly’ attitude on the part of public institutions, to introduce a policy of targeted incentives, and to work to implement initiatives by business associations, which have proved to be crucial to the growth of social enterprises.

It is with this in mind that Sophie Auconie’s report proposes the establishment of a European passport for European Social Entrepreneurship Funds. The report was partially adopted by a large majority (there was no vote on the legislative resolution). The aim is to let the rapporteur enter into negotiations with the Council in order to reach an agreement at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="en">I expressed my support for this initiative and for the text that was agreed between the European Parliament and the Council. My position is underlined by my belief that we in Europe should foster the development of undertakings that are committed to tackling important issues such as, for instance, ensuring inclusion, fighting marginalisation and poverty. The regulation on the European Social Entrepreneurship Funds would make an important contribution to promoting those undertakings that pursue a social impact in their activity rather than just monetary benefits. Securing better funding opportunities for them is key to supporting the role they fulfil in our societies. The matter is even of a bigger importance, given the economic and societal problems we are facing nowadays in the EU. However, I give my full support to the rapporteur, Ms Sophie Auconie, who called for the final vote on the legislative resolution to be postponed due to the Council’s decision to renegotiate the previously agreed text. I consider that this regulation should not simply be a legislative exercise. The justification for it lies in its potential socio-economic impact, and the European Parliament must stay committed to its position in the renegotiation process.</p>

The few safeguards that Parliament is proposing are still too weak. The possibility that Parliament could use these funds to finance undertakings which finance or support social economy enterprises, but which are not social undertakings themselves, makes one fear that things could drift off course. Likewise, the possibility for any fund to register and conduct their activities anywhere in the European Union without needing to obtain prior authorisation paves the way for the usual abuses.

      <p sl="de">Enterprises are categorised as social undertakings where they aim to achieve social impact and where the primary purpose of the enterprise is to achieve social goals rather than simply to maximise profits. Although social undertakings often receive public funding, investment via private funds investing in a targeted way in social entrepreneurship remain indispensable to their growth. Such social investment funds are rare, however. Cross-border investments in such funds have proven to be complicated and expensive. The European fund is designed to help tackle the chronic shortage in funding for undertakings and initiatives in the field of social entrepreneurship. Access to the fund is designed to be available to undertakings that use their profits to achieve social goals. For that purpose, the idea is that the money in the fund will be opened up, first and foremost, to institutional investors and wealthy individuals. However, experience with micro-credit, inter alia , has shown that well-meaning projects for social purposes with intensive private sector involvement can develop an uncontrollable momentum, under which those who suffer are exactly the people who should have benefited. In this regard, the proposal on the table seems to me too ill-considered, for which reason I am unable to give it my support in the vote.</p>

      <p sl="it">The difficulties faced by many European businesses call loud and clear for an assumption of political responsibility to improve conditions for entrepreneurship. It is necessary to lay down a common framework of rules regarding the use of the designation ‘European Social Entrepreneurship Fund (EuSEF)’, in particular, on the composition of the portfolio of funds that operate under this designation, their eligible investment targets, the tools they may employ and the investors that are eligible to invest in such funds by uniform rules in the Union. In the absence of a common framework, there is a risk that Member States take diverging measures at national level having a direct negative impact on, and creating obstacles to, the good functioning of the internal market, since funds would be subject to different rules in different Member States. Moreover, diverging quality requirements on portfolio composition, investment targets and eligible investors could lead to different levels of investor protection and generate confusion as to the investment proposition associated with a European Social Entrepreneurship Fund. Investors should, lastly, be able to compare the investment propositions of different EuSEFs. It is necessary to remove significant obstacles to cross-border fundraising and to avoid distortions of competition between those funds.</p>

Less good things: the extensive text we had proposed setting out criteria for assessing social impact (based on other EU assessments related to the social economy) and requiring the European supervisor (ESMA) to provide harmonisation was reduced to a more general set of criteria (although this was still much better than the original proposal) and the reporting requirements for non-social enterprise investments were similarly watered down.

      <p sl="pt">This regulation aims to create uniform standards for the funding process for social enterprises, within the framework of the European Commission ‘Social Entrepreneurship Initiative’ (2011).

The definition of ‘social enterprise’ encompasses a ‘large range of undertakings with various legal forms, which provide social services or goods to vulnerable or marginalised persons’, including enterprises ‘that employ a method of production of goods or services with a social objective’. These funds can be useful for financing the so-called third sector, that is to say, collective management companies like cooperatives. Nonetheless, we cannot help but point out that, in a framework in which the troika – including the Commission and the European Central Bank – encourage public divestment and the privatisation of public services on the part of Member States, this solution is a perversion in the sense that the EU supports the transfer of social services to the private sphere, dismantling the social role and public goods at the same time as supporting the funding of private companies to substitute public services.</p>

During the current crisis, highlighted by a fall in the number of loans granted to the real economy, such companies are finding it increasingly difficult to gain access to loans. Venture capital provides early funding to newly created business and is an important source of long-term funding for newly created and innovative SMEs. However, the limited sizes of funds and the fact that they can only provide low levels of capital have prevented them from playing a bigger role in funding new businesses.

Clearly, this ultraliberal report even allows these venture capital funds to evaluate their assets on the basis of their own criteria, preventing there from being any reliable expertise on the matter. I am voting against this dangerous report.</p>

I am voting for this report as I understand that venture capital funds provide undertakings with valuable expertise and knowledge, contribute to the creation of jobs and capital mobilisation, foster the establishment and expansion of innovative undertakings, increase their investment in research and development, and foster entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="pt">The aim of this regulation is to create a European venture capital investment sector for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The express aim of venture capital is to ‘provide finance to undertakings that are generally very small, in the initial stages of their corporate existence’. Financing for SMEs is doubtless a real need, which must be addressed. Nonetheless, in Portugal, SMEs’ growing difficulties result from a continued public disinvestment and an increase in recessive so-called austerity policies. The problems of Portuguese SMEs are the result of a policy of abandoning and destroying our production and productive apparatus, an internal market that is increasingly stifled by workers’ decreasing acquisition capacity, and a fiscal policy which penalises work and small companies. Privatisation, which has put energy companies, banks, telecommunications and transport companies and providers of essential goods and services in the hands of big businesses, at monopoly prices, is one of the causes of SMEs’ economic strangulation. It is this policy which must be reversed and which has led to 46.7% more companies declaring bankruptcy in the first semester of the year than during the same period last year.</p>

For security reasons, a safeguard clause has been added, enabling the original customs tariffs to be reinstituted in certain circumstances. This concerns, in particular, cases where goods are imported in such large quantities that they cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to Union industry producing a similar or directly competitive product. Parliament therefore wanted to activate the stabilisation mechanism for bananas, which enables us, until 1 January 2020, to suspend preferential customs treatment when a certain annual import volume has been reached.

In this context, I would like to emphasise the importance of the safeguard clause in liberalising the trade in agricultural products. It provides a safety net in the situation where the markets are faced with a certain amount of disruption as a result of signing the bilateral agreements. I should also highlight the monitoring and reporting provisions. They are vital for ensuring that this regulation is applied properly.

The provisions proposed by the European Commission for the bilateral safeguard clause of the Peru and Colombia Trade Agreement are similar to the bilateral safeguard clause of the FTA between the EU and the Republic of Korea, apart from two essential differences – the stabilisation mechanism for bananas and special treatment for remote and vulnerable regions of the European Union.

More specifically, in the case of serious injury to European banana producers as a result of opening up trade with Colombia and Peru, the reduced tariffs provided for within the framework of the trade agreement would be increased again. This mechanism is essential for safeguarding our European producers as the EU represents the most important market for banana exports and 72.5% of bananas sold in the EU already come from Latin America.</p>

These tools must be used effectively – they must be streamlined and not bureaucratic – so long as it is justified.

As the rapporteur states, these agreements raised some technical and philosophical problems, which must be resolved. There are technical problems because we need to protect European producers from unfair competition and make the safeguard clauses work; and there are philosophical problems because on top of trade policy, we must include obligations regarding human rights, working conditions, the environment, and so on. While the outermost European regions are in a somewhat vulnerable competitive situation, the existence of safeguard clauses in accordance with World Trade Organisation provisions protects them. I regret that it has still not been possible to arrive at an agreement with Peru, and I hope that this will happen soon.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In March 2011, after a turbulent process, the Commission signed a trade agreement with Colombia and Peru. Many social forces in these two countries and in Europe were against this agreement. Countries like Bolivia and Ecuador decided to abandon negotiations, accusing the EU of not wanting more than a free trade agreement. In fact, this is true. The consequences – which are profoundly negative – will be felt on both sides of the Atlantic. In the area of bananas, the agreements anticipated losses for European producers. They therefore included a safeguard clause which, as experience has shown us, will not prevent these losses. The opinion of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture itself recognises this. There are many weaknesses mentioned in this clause. With unacceptable hypocrisy and intolerable cynicism, for a body that, at the end of the day, approved the agreement, it has even proposed, like the Commission, the enlargement of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for these farmers, recognising that they are being condemned to ruin. Portugal, especially the Autonomous Region of Madeira, where banana production is important, will also be affected.</p>

The provisions proposed by the European Commission for the bilateral safeguard clause of the Peru and Colombia Trade Agreement are very similar to the pattern of the regulation implementing the bilateral safeguard clause of the FTA between the EU and the Republic of Korea, which was the first safeguard regulation where the European Parliament acted as a colegislator.

The text recognises that there are problems in terms of employment rights in the countries concerned, although this recognition is not sufficient. The rapporteur also calls for greater consideration of social and environmental aspects within the framework of the forthcoming economic liberalisation. The Commission must understand this message. Moreover, the texts clearly state the need for greater consideration of overseas countries, where bananas are a pillar of the economy.

Both the agreement with Colombia and Peru and that signed with the six Central American countries contain a chapter on mutual recognition of geographical indications, which will enable the EU to protect around 200 geographical indications. Out of all the exports by these countries to the EU, bananas are the star agricultural product, mainly from Colombia and Costa Rica, and, to a much lesser extent, from Panama, Honduras, Peru and Guatemala.

      <p sl="pl">Both of the reports being discussed today concern what is known as a sensitive product, which needs to be covered by a detailed legal framework. Bananas, which are the product we are discussing, come to the European Union by way of imports from third countries (leaving aside, of course, the EU’s peripheral regions such as the Canary Islands, Martinique or Guadeloupe), which is why they are subject to the relevant customs duties. Trade agreements with Colombia, Peru and Central American countries are to be covered by appropriate safeguard clauses that are meant to prevent disruptions that could be caused by the import of bananas into the European market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission’s proposals do not, however, take into account the issue of careful supervision of trade nor any protection for European producers who may be harmed by excessive trade liberalisation. As a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am in favour of enabling the application of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in this instance.

      <p sl="en">In favour. It is rather unlikely that the safeguard clause will ever be applied. Nevertheless, the report is an occasion to bring into the discussion aspects other than rises and declines in export/import data. Greens followed the rapporteur in his call for a closer look not only at economic implications of the foreseen trade liberalisation, but also the implementation of environmental and social aspects. The respect of international conventions in these areas should be fully monitored and reported. To this end, trade unions, NGOs, the European Parliament and concerned civil society organisations should be consulted. Furthermore, an explicit reference to the outermost regions should be introduced. Though DG Trade was not happy with a good number of the amendments proposed (39 in the International Trade Committee, plus the Agriculture Committee opinion), which they considered as outside their realm of competence (such as social and environmental data!!), and though DG Trade carried out extensive lobbying ahead of the International Trade Committee vote, a good number of those amendments passed.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the amendments on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council implementing the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas of the trade agreement between the European Union and Colombia and Peru. Appropriate safety mechanisms need to be introduced to prevent serious harm to banana growing in the EU, a sector which is of huge importance to the end agricultural production of several of the outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The limited ability of these regions to diversify their economies, due to their natural characteristics, makes banana growing a particularly vulnerable production sector. It is therefore essential to create effective mechanisms for managing preferential imports from third countries, in order to guarantee that banana production in the EU, which is a crucial employment sector especially in the outermost regions, is maintained under the best possible conditions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of complying with the international labour regulations drafted and monitored by the International Labour Organisation. Ensuring decent working conditions for all must be an absolute priority for this sector, and bananas imported from Colombia or Peru must be produced under decent social and environmental conditions and for a fair wage to prevent EU producers from becoming the victims of dumping.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In June 2012, the European Union concluded an association agreement with Central America. For security reasons, a safeguard clause has been added, enabling the original customs tariffs to be reinstituted in certain circumstances. This concerns, in particular, cases where goods are imported in such large quantities that they cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to Union industry producing a similar or directly competitive product. Parliament therefore wanted to activate the stabilisation mechanism for bananas, which enables us, until 1 January 2020, to suspend preferential customs treatment when a certain annual import volume has been reached. We are thinking here, in particular, of banana producers concentrated in the outermost regions, who could be affected by this agreement.</p>

The agreement also includes a stabilisation mechanism for bananas according to which preferential customs duties can be suspended if a certain import volume is reached (applicable until 2020). It is very important to ensure the effectiveness of both the stabilisation mechanism for bananas and the safeguard clause.</p>

The sector must face competition from American bananas, mainly produced in Central America, sometimes under questionable social and environmental conditions, and at a very competitive cost price. It is therefore essential for the European Union to equip itself with mechanisms allowing it to protect European bananas.

In spite of the willingness on the part of Europe to contribute to the stability, progress and development of exporting countries, it is worth remembering that bananas are also a product produced in the EU. The bananas are of very high quality and come from outermost regions whose economies, due to their specific circumstances, deserve special attention and protection from European decision makers. The agreements established for this product must take these circumstances into account and provide for mechanisms which defend European interests.

      <p sl="pt">Colombia and Central America will completely alter their trade relations with the European Union, opening markets through eliminating tariff barriers and facilitating trade. This report, drafted by Mr Leichtfried, concerns the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council which applies the bilateral safeguard clause and the stabilisation mechanism for bananas in the association agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Central America, on the other. As the rapporteur mentions, these agreements raised some technical and philosophical problems. They raised technical problems because we need to protect European producers from unfair competition and make the safeguard clauses work; and philosophical problems because on top of trade policy, we must include obligations regarding human rights, working conditions, the environment, and so on. While the outermost European regions are in a somewhat vulnerable competitive situation, the existence of safeguard clauses in accordance with World Trade Organisation provisions protects them. I voted in favour as there will be more transparency through comprehensive monitoring by the Commission, which will present a report on this trade before Parliament every year.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Commission has signed a free trade agreement with six countries from Central America: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. This agreement totally or partially liberalises the trade in certain agricultural products. Out of all the exports by these countries to the EU, bananas are the most important agricultural product, and North American multinationals their main producers, in extensive areas of monoculture in which locals’ working conditions come close to slavery. For these reasons, there are numerous organisations that have denounced the labour, social and environmental dumping practices, which are a result of this agreement and, more generally, a result of free trade and agriculture being subjected to World Trade Organisation rules. The safeguard clause and stabilisation mechanism proposed here will not be worth anything. Their weaknesses are numerous and their inefficiency is expressed in the very opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. The stabilisation mechanism will not be automatic, as the Commission will be free to decide whether or not to apply it. Parliament recognises its inability – and, we would add, its unwillingness – to contradict the Commission, in spite of all the propaganda surrounding its increased role in trade policy.</p>

The rapporteur also calls for greater consideration of social and environmental aspects within the framework of the forthcoming economic liberalisation. The Commission must understand this message. Moreover, the texts clearly state the need for greater consideration of overseas countries, where bananas are a pillar of the economy.

Nevertheless, the report is an occasion to bring into the discussion aspects other than rises and declines in export/import data. Greens followed the rapporteur in his call for a closer look not only at economic implications of the foreseen trade liberalisation, but also the implementation of environmental and social aspects. The respect for international conventions in these areas should be fully monitored and reported. To this end, trade unions, NGOs, the European Parliament and concerned civil society organisations should be consulted. Furthermore, an explicit reference to the outermost regions should be introduced. Though DG Trade was not happy with a good number of the amendments proposed (45 in the International Trade Committee, plus the Agriculture Committee opinion), which they considered as outside their realm of competence (such as social and environmental data!!), and though DG Trade carried out extensive lobbying ahead of the International Trade Committee vote, a good number of those amendments passed.

The online availability of orphan works across Europe also represents a fundamental stepping stone in the creation of a climate of cultural wealth, also bearing in mind the extraordinary variety and productivity of European authors as a whole. Above all, this initiative facilitates ongoing education, including for adults, and helps offer further cultural opportunities to the so-called ‘Millennial Generation’ – young people who operate almost exclusively using digital means. I must make special mention of Ms Geringer de Oedenberg’s hard work on aspects relating to copyright checks so that a work can be legally certified as an orphan work.

This proposal for a directive aims to resolve this issue through a new legislative framework. I welcome the approval of this proposal since, thanks to digitisation and dissemination through the Internet, it is possible to make the work available to the interested public without fear of the author appearing.

At the same time, European legislation provides for certain exceptions that allow scanning for preservation purposes, but they do not allow libraries to make the digitised works available online on the Internet, even for non-commercial purposes. However, we live in a digital era. The rational dissemination of information online has enormous advantages for the internal market. The digitisation of cultural material should also be supported at a European level. The European Parliament has already expressed support in the past for the idea of ​​finding a legislative solution to the problematic issue of orphan works. In future, new legislation will make it possible to have Europe-wide online access to such orphan works.</p>

      <p sl="en">Cultural works, whether a book, a film or a piece of music, which do not have an identified author or creator, known as orphan works, provide a useful addition to the preservation of our cultural heritage. This directive will allow such works to be used by libraries and other public institutions for non-commercial use so that access to them can be widened. Orphan works will continue to receive copyright protection, and my ECR colleagues and I have worked to ensure there are appropriate safeguards in place if a work is inadvertently designated as orphan. Furthermore, we have secured guarantees in the final compromise package that any diligent search carried out to determine whether a work is orphan should be done for each individual work so that the intellectual property rights of authors and creators are fully respected.

Without authorisation from the right holder, these works are not accessible to the public. We therefore wanted to authorise libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives to provide specific services in the internal market which involve the display of orphan works online. However, in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which was consulted for its opinion, we wanted to provide clarifications with regard to copyright in order to avoid any misuse.

On the other hand, I think that works whose authors are unknown or who can no longer be identified, generally known as ‘orphan works’, must be accessible to the public to the same extent, without causing any detriment to the institutions which own them.

As it stands, the situation is that libraries that have digitised such works cannot make them available, as the question of creatorship cannot be resolved. As a result, even the non-commercial use of orphan works is not possible. Furthermore, there is no Europe-wide regulation of this area at present, which means that the accessibility of orphan works varies from Member State to Member State, which can give rise to considerable disadvantages for individual users. Since there has been a court decision in the United States that has authorised Google Books to publish orphan works, there is also a considerable competitive disadvantage for the EU in the online market. Intellectual property is an asset that should be particularly well protected, especially in these days of the online media. According to the report, there would be an option to revoke the status of a work as an orphan work if an author were to report justified infringements of his/her copyright as a result of publication.

For younger generations, especially, who are used to digital forms, what is not on the Internet might as well not exist. In short, orphan works represent a lost heritage that a powerful American search engine would like to take sole ownership of, although this is only limited to US works for now. Despite the Commission’s 24 August 2006 Recommendation, only a few Member States have introduced legislation on orphan works, limiting online access to citizens resident in their national territories. What this House is asking today is for libraries, educational establishments, museums and archives to be allowed to provide specific services for the online display of orphan works, whose ownership would be immediately recognised if, one day, the owner came forward with a duly documented request.</p>

The availability of orphan works across the Union would promote Europe’s cultural diversity and provide a further source of knowledge and learning. Should the author then be found after all, it would be possible to revoke the status of ‘orphan work’ again. On the other hand, a great many issues relating to copyright remain unresolved.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because it is aimed at adopting a regulation setting out aid measures for Pakistan, which was recently affected by floods. Basically, this regulation seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences applied to 75 product lines. Despite the fact that humanitarian aid is already being provided, trade preferences would contribute even more to combating the negative long-term economic consequences of the floods. The recovery of the state of Pakistan is important not only for its citizens, but also for the overall stability of the region. Before determining how long to extend autonomous trade preferences for, it is important for the Commission to carry out a full assessment. This should assess the overall impact of the measures on EU trade and production, their effectiveness on the population and fiscal resources of Pakistan, as well as Pakistan’s commitments to improve the effectiveness of its taxation system. Strict compliance with the relevant rules of origin for products is necessary, as is ensuring that the trade preferences only benefit those they are intended for and it is also crucial that they truly serve Pakistan’s economic recovery. It is also important to stress that a worsening of the human rights situation in Pakistan in the future may lead to the suspension of the trade preferences.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report on granting emergency autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan. Following the terrible monsoon rains that caused severe landslides in Pakistan in 2010, the European Union has decided to put in place support measures for this region. This support comes in the form of a temporary agreement on increased market access to the Union through the exoneration of customs duties or tariff quotas for some products, mainly from the textile sector, which accounts for the majority of trade between the EU and Pakistan. Nevertheless, these trade preferences would only apply if guarantees of respect for human rights were provided in exchange for this aid. Furthermore, it seems crucial to limit the duration of the autonomous trade preferences to 31 December 2013 so as to allow the Commission to fully evaluate the impact of the measures.</p>

As shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) for this report and a Member for Portugal, I closely monitored this process and twice submitted questions to the Commission and the Council on this issue. What was in question was essentially the use of EU trade policy as a tool for humanitarian policy, an unparalleled precedent in the history of the EEC or the EU. I therefore voted against this report. This does not mean that I am against humanitarian aid to Pakistan as a response to emergency situations created by floods, conflicts and Afghan refugees. Far from it, in fact! As a European, I commend and support without reservation the amount of EUR 2.458 billion in humanitarian aid being granted to the Pakistani population for the period 2009-2013 by the Member States and the Commission.

The European Union’s trade policy cannot be used as a humanitarian aid instrument in the long term, but certain exceptional circumstances may justify one-off trade facilities.

These tragic circumstances motivated the presentation, on the part of the Commission, of a proposal for a regulation which introduces emergency trade preferences for Pakistan.

I believe that the European Union should not be closed in on itself and should aim to help those most in need so that, in principle, there are no repairs to be made to the same preferential regime. Nonetheless, I believe that this cannot be disassociated from a permanent demand on the part of the EU regarding the need for those who receive our aid to respect human rights.

In terms of humanitarian aid, the European Union always leads the way. That was the case when floods devastated a large part of Pakistan, with enormous human and material losses. In addition to humanitarian assistance in the first hours of the disaster, the EU also sought other ways to support the country’s economic recovery, as is set out in the proposed regulation. I hope that Pakistan’s economy recovers quickly and that it is transformed into a prosperous country and not a refuge for terrorists.

It is worth remembering that this proposal was drafted following floods, which affected the country in 2010. As we stated back then, forms of effective aid and genuine solidarity with the people of this country are necessary. However, the floods ended up being a pretext to satisfy the interests of those who, in Europe, will benefit from these measures. At the same time, it harms countries and regions which are more dependent on industries like the textiles, clothing, footwear, components, leather goods and leather substitutes sectors. In Portugal, representatives from the footwear, components, leather goods and leather substitutes sectors have repeatedly expressed concern about the impact that the proposal for granting emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan will have on their sectors. This impact is severe in a sector that is already very weakened – as it was hit hard by the liberalisation of world trade – and which is concentrated in regions with high levels of unemployment, poverty and marginalisation, and with low economic diversification. However, it becomes even more serious when these regions are situated in Member States, like Portugal, which are facing an extremely serious economic and social crisis.</p>

In addition, it should be noted that the Commission’s proposal does not impose any burden on Pakistan in the field of human and social rights. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences for flood stricken Pakistan may be followed by other similar initiatives in the future.

The planned removal of import duties on 75 products threatens thousands of jobs in the EU.

Given the tough economic situation in the EU, these negative consequences of the agreement are not justifiable. The planned agreement is not only dubious from an economic point of view, however; it also fails in terms of the original goal of trade facilitation as a form of emergency aid. As a result of the initial refusal of India to accept the trade agreement in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the negotiations on the agreement have been long delayed. Two years after the flood disaster, we can no longer talk of short-term emergency aid. It goes without saying that the EU’s relations with Pakistan – which is capable of playing a major role in the security of the region – are of major importance. However, with the approval of over EUR 415 million for emergency humanitarian aid and with the additional provision of EUR 114.8 million through the amendment of ongoing programmes towards rebuilding, the EU has already demonstrated its solidarity with Pakistan.

I also would like to denounce, as a matter of priority, the support given by various external actors and states to all parties to the conflict, with financial, logistical and tactical aid, including the supply of weapons, munitions and all other types of military equipment. We must bear in mind that any further militarisation of the conflict can only bring greater suffering to the Syrian people and the region as a whole.</p>

It was thus with dismay and some disgust that I voted again for this resolution on the situation in Syria – with mixed feelings which seem to be shared by the whole House – and I hope that the hypocrisy of the international community, based on a set of criteria, in the light of similar, recent situations, will come to an end as soon as possible and that the Syrian population can aspire to a future in peace and harmony, in a country which is going through a difficult time, which goes against obscure idealism mixed with genuine cries for freedom to a regime that is fighting to survive, as I stated in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The news and images that are reaching us about Syria show us the brutality which is devastating the country and how it is mired in the most cruel and fratricidal of wars. The attempts by al-Assad’s regime to survive international condemnation and quell the popular revolt have failed. However, the insurgents do not yet seem to possess the capacity to obtain a decisive military victory, which could bring the regime to an end. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council has been blocked by two of its permanent members, preventing the international community from taking measures towards a more resolute intervention in the country. This situation of brutality and paralysis is affecting, above all, defenceless citizens who suffer and pay with their lives for their desire to live in peace and democracy. The European Union and Parliament cannot but vehemently condemn what is happening in Syria, demand that the hostilities come to an end, and encourage the transition to a free, democratic and peaceful Syria.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The humanitarian, political and military situation in Syria has been the subject of various analyses in this Parliament over the last two years, and resolutions condemning the brutal acts of the al-Assad regime have even been voted upon. Living conditions in Syria are getting worse day by day, in the face of the impotence of an international community which has not managed to put an end to one of the cruellest and most fratricidal wars of our times. This joint motion for a Parliament resolution presented by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists Group and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe addresses the political situation in Syria, where a dictatorial regime led by President Bashar al-Assad continues to violate the most basic human rights, resulting in more than 60 000 victims among a defenceless population which only wishes to live in peace and democracy. Furthermore, al-Assad’s air force is continuing to massacre the rebel forces and devastate civilian areas, and it has not even been possible to establish a humanitarian corridor. I regret that the international community continues to hesitate to resolve this conflict, in particular, the behaviour of the superpowers China and Russia, which have not assumed their political and humanitarian responsibilities within the United Nations Security Council.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Just like the positions adopted to attack Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, the majority of Parliament is once again insisting on a destabilisation campaign in Syria, widely broadcast by the mainstream media. There are aims to exacerbate real, existing problems, to manipulate facts, to hide the responsibilities of the EU, the USA, NATO and the major powers of the EU, and of obscurantist monarchies and fundamentalists in the Gulf region, in order to support military aggression in Syria. On the ground, a strategy of militarisation, subversion, aggression, interference and war continues by the so-called ‘friends of Syria group’, some of whom have been identified as belonging to terrorist networks, funded, armed and trained by imperialist powers, namely France and the United Kingdom, and by dictatorships in the Persian Gulf. The majority of Parliament is once again on the side of those that carry out actions against efforts developed to resolve the situation in Syria through political and diplomatic means. In Syria, imperialism seeks to repeat wars of aggression perpetrated in the name of human rights and democracy, but whose real motives are the economic and geostrategic interests of the main imperialist powers of NATO, and the profit of the military complex and associated multinationals. Obviously, we voted against the resolution.</p>

Tens of thousands more who flee from Syria into neighbouring countries do not register. According to UN estimates, more than 1.2 million people have been internally displaced within Syria and around 3 million are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.

I therefore consider it right that the proposal opens with a call to halt the violence. Despite this, I feel that the text is too abstract. The calls to the Syrian regime are academic, as the EU’s powers do not extend to that unhappy land. They do extend, however, to the Member States. I therefore consider it essential for the resolution to include a call on Member States to put an immediate halt to military hardware, logistics and intelligence support for all parties in the conflict. We must call on all Member State governments to strictly honour and uphold international law when addressing the conflict in Syria, and to seek peace talks between all parties in the conflict. We should learn a lesson from the Libyan tragedy, when innocent people perished under NATO bombing and a population continues to live in chaos on account of NATO and EU support for an unstable regime. Our position should be clear concerning the UN Security Council talks on Syria. It is, above all, necessary to put our own house in order. We cannot look on while certain European statesmen demand, on behalf of the EU, a halt to the violence and respect for human rights by day, and then by night the same statesmen decide, on behalf of NATO, to supply arms to the rebels. Legal nihilism cannot be blurred by any propaganda, at least not in countries where people are dying.</p>

Faced with escalating violence, we must help the population by providing emergency medical supplies and food, by setting up humanitarian corridors and by establishing no-fly zones. We must also urgently refer this matter to the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity. If we stand idly by and watch as massacres are taking place in Syria, we will have to explain ourselves to future generations. Inaction is not an option, as Ban Ki-moon rightly said.</p>

Unfortunately, there are too many external influences that are simply aggravating the situation in the country. We hear, for example, that there have been weapons deliveries to both sides in the conflict. Meanwhile, paid mercenaries, too, are said to be active in Syria. That is totally unacceptable. The international powers must not abuse Syria as a pawn in their games and a strategic marching zone. The objective must be to put a stop to the bloodshed as quickly as possible. To that end, the pressure on the Assad regime must be increased in order to prevent further violations of human rights, while, at the same time, it must be made clear in conversation with the opposition that there is a need for a transition to democracy that is as ordered and peaceful as possible. A chaos like that in Libya must be avoided.

Today’s vote reaffirms this House’s unbending support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights’ call for the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, in view of a formal investigation. Syria must firmly commit to ensuring that all those responsible for violations of human rights and international law are identified and called to answer for their actions, offering real support for the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which is tasked with investigating all violations of international human rights standards and international humanitarian law in the country, thereby ensuring that the culprits are brought to justice.</p>

Although freedom of expression is of great value to our civilisation, this should not exempt us from critically appraising its manifestations. For my part, and without denying freedom of expression, I think the action of the band ‘Pussy Riot’ was in very bad taste. In religious terms, we have seen actions carried out in places of worship across Europe clearly disrespecting believers’ religious sentiments and, often, exhibiting clear hostility towards them. Believers are not lesser citizens than others. There are certainly other ways to condemn the Russian regime. Nonetheless, more important than all this is the political issue and the functioning of the rule of law, the proportionality of punishment and its use for political aims.

It is not possible to separate this campaign from Russia’s role in the United Nations Security Council, preventing the USA, the EU and NATO from achieving their strategy of instrumentalising the UN to try to legitimise military aggression towards Syria. This strategy is as old as imperialism and seeks to create and foster international press campaigns to label and isolate Russia.</p>

The Russian Federation is a full member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and has therefore committed itself to the principles of democracy and respect for human rights.

      <p sl="lv">I supported this motion for a resolution because I believe Russia’s judiciary system is using disproportionate force against opposition politicians and activists. Relations between the European Union and Russia are based on mutual economic benefit, but it is important that Russia observes such values as the rule of law and democracy. The European Union cannot ignore the increasing trend of turning against individuals inconvenient to the authorities through criminal proceedings. Even if I find the actions of the punk band Pussy Riot in the Orthodox Church unacceptable, I believe the punishment is disproportionate to the offence. That gives rise to concern about the recent upsurge in the politically motivated intimidation and prosecution of opposition activists. At the same time, the murderers of Anna Politkovskaya and the people responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky have still not yet been found and punished. To me, the discovery and conviction of the people guilty of these murders is a test that would show Russia is moving in the direction of the rule of law. Unfortunately, at present, no realistic person can express anything more than an ironic wish for the murderers of opposition activists to be discovered and convicted as swiftly as the members of the punk band Pussy Riot. I am firmly convinced that we in Parliament do not have the right to ignore the violations of human rights in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="cs">An orgy of hypocrisy – that is the only way to sum up the content of the motion for a resolution on the political use of justice in Russia. Centre-right politicians insist that they are the true interpreters of democracy. They show us how it is possible to condemn anyone from a country outside the EU. Bishop Rydzyk from Radio Maria and his mohair berets must be clapping loudly, not just in Poland, but across the EU. In a time of crisis for the capitalist system, it is a very useful to talk about things we do not like in other countries. These naughty Russians still refuse to see that when it rains in the EU, they need to open their umbrellas in Moscow. I can imagine how the Russian Duma would condemn the tough stance of the German police against demonstrators opposing the reconstruction of the station in Stuttgart. I can imagine my esteemed fellow MEPs praising a punk band performing in a Catholic cathedral somewhere with idiotic words demanding the resignation of the current Pope, because the Catholic Church in many parts of the world turned a blind eye to clerical child sex abuse. It is a pity, for example, that the European Parliament has so far failed to comment on the dirty operations of the US secret services in the case of the Miami Five – the Cubans convicted of documenting the terrorist activities of emigrants against their homeland. I feel ashamed of the MEPs who produced this joint motion for a resolution, and, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to say a clear NO to this farce.</p>

      <p sl="bg">It was with a feeling of deep satisfaction that I supported this resolution because it contains a clear message by the citizens of Europe to Putin’s Russia. At the previous debates on resolutions dealing with the presidential and parliamentary elections in Russia, the most difficult issues and greatest doubts were left unaddressed. Even then, immediately after the fraud and threats against the opposition’s leaders, which were followed by unprecedented civil protests, the following questions were floating around the Chamber: How will the Kremlin react? Will it take the path of dialogue and strengthening the foundations of democracy or will it choose the familiar path of violence and kangaroo court justice against its political opponents? Even if there had been someone naive enough to wonder which direction Putin’s Russia will take, all optimistic illusions were completely dispelled in just a few months. The resolution adopted just now reveals a repulsive picture of acts of political repression which are prepared and carried out with the involvement of the parliament, the government, the public prosecution service and the courts, in other words, the entire state machine stifles, including through special legislation, pluralism and the opposition’s voice. I voted in favour of this resolution because it does not restrict the solidarity in defence of democracy to the EU Member States. With it, we are showing the citizens of Russia that the citizens of Europe will always support their aspirations to make their country freer and more democratic.</p>

The question does arise, however, of whether it is the EU’s job – and the Union itself is not without its faults and is currently struggling with other problems – to constantly intervene in Russian domestic affairs. That, after all, is exactly what the Pussy Riot case is. A rock band infiltrated the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow – the central church of the Russian Orthodox church, comparable to Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome for Catholics – and chanted slogans such as ‘The church is God’s crap!’ at the faithful there present. First of all, this is tasteless behaviour. When the Western media translates this unannounced and unauthorised ‘concert’ before the altar into a ‘punk prayer in church’, you have to wonder why it does so. To laud Pussy Riot for this action and hold them up as a symbol of freedom and democracy is not only impious, it is also simply too see-through as yet another means of attacking President Putin. The same applies to the outrage at their conviction – a conviction that is understandable even just on the basis of the band’s lack of contrition. The severity of the punishment is another matter. Despite all the justified criticism of events in Russia, this resolution should be rejected as too one-sided, and I therefore voted against it.</p>

However, neither the European Parliament, nor the EU as a whole will turn a blind eye to the Kremlin’s efforts to limit the actions of a civil society that is wakening up. There have been several positive changes in Russia recently: the country joined the WTO and committed to trade in accordance with international standards. In the spring, steps were taken towards fairer procedures for the registration of parties and presidential election candidates and the restoration of direct elections for regional governors. Unfortunately, at the same time, we are seeing ever fewer signs of the Kremlin’s willingness to cooperate with civil movements. Its intolerance of activists expressing a different opinion is becoming increasingly clear. Laws are adopted in the Duma at the speed of light, which reduce the freedom to demonstrate and the area of NGO activities. I voted in favour of this resolution because it calls for Russia to steer a course towards becoming a state that respects the rule of law and guarantees human rights.

It also seems that the decision-making body will be made up only of representatives from euro area Member States.

They also agreed, as I have maintained, that to achieve the final phase of EMU, it will be necessary to work on four essential pillars: a banking union, a budget union, an economic union and a political union. To this end, yesterday, the EU presented a proposal which aims to move towards a banking union which, despite its merits, is based on Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This article aims to circumscribe Parliament’s participation in drafting this legislation, forgetting one of the pillars which the European leaders set for themselves: that of political union and democratic legitimacy.

Now, Mr Barroso is moving forward with a new proposal: the creation of a European banking union aimed not only at euro area countries, but which also cooperates with countries outside the euro area that want to join. The soundness of the euro implies the existence of supervision at EU level which is guaranteed by this new legislative framework and carried out by the European Central Bank. As such, citizens’ savings would be guaranteed and, if a financial institution fails, it would not be taxpayers who pay the price, as currently occurs. I voted for this proposal, as it responds to the main challenges that the euro area is facing: breaking the link between the banking sector and sovereign debt and creating a single, effective European monitoring mechanism which will support the Member States. There will be a single book on the banking sector, which must be applied to the 27 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The majority of Parliament claims that the supervision of the banking sector should move from national authorities to the European Central Bank (ECB). They claim that this sector, which is fundamental for financing countries’ economies, should stop being under the direct responsibility of the Member States and that it should become the responsibility of the ECB to intervene in this area. The ECB, without any political and democratic control, has fulfilled the triple role of lowering the refinancing costs of big capital – promoting Member States’ dependence on the funding – of the financial sector, with its so-called ‘markets’, and promoting labour exploitation through covering losses in purchasing power with credit. Countries like Portugal, which do not have their own currency and cannot autonomously intervene in monetary policy, also remain limited in the regulation of the financial sector. What economies like that of Portugal need in order to grow is the nationalisation of the banking sector, putting it at the service of the national economy. Portugal needs a public banking system which finances an increase in national production and a programme of reindustrialisation, a fundamental tool for creating employment with rights, increasing salaries, reducing dependence on other countries, and thereby resolving the problems of deficit and public debt.</p>

In my view, it is essential that we achieve a fully functioning European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as soon as possible, which, although it certainly further limits Member State sovereignty over public finances, at least has the benefit of excluding the contributions they pay from the calculation of their sovereign debts.</p>

      <p sl="hu">We expect accountability with regard to the common banking supervision of the euro area. This is what the resolution that I myself supported at the Thursday vote states. The document calls on Member States to introduce ‘quality’ rules to guarantee the democratic accountability of the common European banking supervision to be established, but also notes that on the basis of current Member State concepts, there is a risk that the actual rules will send the wrong message and will sustain poor efficiency. I am hoping for a system that would stabilise the euro area – after all, this is in the interest of non-euro area countries as well – while not making the situation of banks outside the euro area worse. Unfortunately, some measures that reinforce the stability of the euro area (such as the withdrawal of capital from eastern subsidiaries to allow increased lending at home) can have an acute impact on Member States outside the euro area. It must therefore be pointed out that the resolution stresses the importance of the creation of a mechanism to manage the ripple effects of the establishment of a banking union in the euro area on non-euro area Member States.

      <p sl="fr">I supported the resolution on the creation of a banking union. The Commission presented its proposal for banking supervision on 12 September. It was on this occasion that Parliament expressed its position on the subject: if we want to prevent new financial crises and stabilise the euro area in the long term, it is essential to have better supervision in the banking sector, particularly through the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA). However, what we especially wanted to show in this text is that Parliament’s prerogatives must absolutely be respected in these future mechanisms. The specific missions entrusted to the ECB and the EBA must be the subject of strict democratic controls, without which the banking union proposal would be void of substance. We will stand our ground on this point.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament voted today in favour of the resolution on the European banking union, as we think it is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal for a new banking authority in the euro area countries will be established on the basis of Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, thus excluding Parliament from the process. In one of the resolution’s citations, the possible creation of a European Stability Fund for banks is mentioned. While it is one thing to establish a European fund of this nature from scratch, we think it is a different thing entirely, in a situation where certain Member States have established this type of fund at national level and others have not, to combine existing funds into one joint fund. That is something about which we have serious doubts.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe a banking union and a single supervisory mechanism are needed in the European Union. At the same time, I should like to emphasise that the Commission must develop this mechanism to a very high quality in order to avoid distorting competition in those Member States in which the euro has not yet been introduced. I can only express regret that such a union and such supervision were not established along with the introduction of the single currency, because that would have allowed several Member States to avoid bank collapse or nationalisation. The European Central Bank will have the decisive role in this process. The Member States will have to hand over certain supervisory functions to the ECB, which has caused dissatisfaction in several Member States, but our financial situation will benefit from it in the long term. The ECB has not given any reason to doubt its independence and is able to take decisions that are significantly more difficult to adopt at a national level in a calm and rational way. I consider this a decision that will help Europe regain the trust of the financial markets.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This resolution has the merit of making a statement that is common sense: ‘It is crucial to break the link between banks and sovereigns’. Unfortunately, it will have no effect. It makes no mention of the proposal to authorise the European Central Bank (ECB) to lend directly to States, who are the only ones capable of resolving the problem. More and more European economists and politicians support this theory. However, clearly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has not been listening. I denounce this unprecedented blindness. Nonetheless, I appreciate, firstly, that the resolution recalls that a European Banking Authority, which responds to the same objectives as those of this ‘banking union’ that we are sick and tired of hearing about, was already established in 2010 and, secondly, that it denounces the exclusion of Parliament from the process of establishing the banking union, which the Council is trying to impose. I therefore abstained.</p>

      <p sl="de">The regulation of the banks is a first step towards a European banking union. We have thus come to the crunch, and much sooner than expected. It is clear that this supervisory authority, which is to be located within the ECB, cannot be responsible for all 6 000 banks in the euro area. Smaller institutions should be monitored by the national authorities in any case. Cross-border shared liability is a mistake, as the harmonisation of EU supervision law and practice are not sufficiently developed for this purpose. Thus, if the euro area Member States and this House were to support the Commission proposal, hard-up banks could receive funding directly from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) as of the start of 2013, without recourse to the Member State in question. That would represent collective liability for European bank debts in itself. It would also mean that the crisis fund, as capital provider, would also become the co-owner of ailing institutions such as those in Spain. Cross-border credit and transfer services represent the de facto communitarisation of the liability. The banks would have to pay money into a common European deposit guarantee scheme without being able to influence the risk and business policy of the banks in other Member States. That is like an invitation to pursue particularly risky business activities that such institutions would otherwise avoid. All the proposals should therefore be rejected.</p>

I strongly support the detailed strategy for the parallel creation of integrated financial and budgetary frameworks and economic policy, while at the same time maintaining the right level of democratic legitimacy.

Without these areas, it will not be possible to rebuild a stable European financial system.</p>

I therefore support the creation of a banking union where the European Central Bank is the only entity responsible for banking supervision, while transparency and accountability of such institutions vis-à-vis Parliament must be increased.

      <p sl="lv">The motion for a resolution ‘Towards a banking union’ should be supported. The creation of a banking union – at least within the euro area – is a significant step that would allow the direct dependence of the banking system on the debt situation and credit ratings of the Member States to be broken. It is good that the resolution contains a reference to all of the three most important features of the potential banking union – central supervision, a common deposit guarantee scheme, and a bank resolution scheme. Centralised solutions for banking problems that have arisen in Member States are particularly important for the smaller Member States, whose budgets in the case of a crisis end up in a very tense situation, since the amount of deposits to be paid out if a bank goes bankrupt can be huge in relation to those budgets. The existence of a central deposit guarantee scheme would, in many cases, prevent at the outset many bank bankruptcies caused by sudden and massive withdrawals of deposits for fear of losing them.

      <p sl="pt">It does not worry the majority of Parliament that the supervision of the banking sector should move from national authorities to the European Central Bank (ECB). Neither does it worry them that this sector, which is fundamental for financing countries’ economies, stops being under the direct responsibility of the Member States and that it becomes the responsibility of the ECB to intervene in this area. The ECB is no more than an institution which – without any political or democratic control – has fulfilled the triple role of lowering the refinancing costs of big capital – promoting Member States’ dependence on the funding – vis-à-vis big business in Europe, and promoting labour exploitation by covering losses in purchasing power with credit. Countries like Portugal, which do not have their own currency and cannot autonomously intervene in monetary policy, also stop being able to regulate the financial sector. What economies like that of Portugal need in order to grow is the nationalisation of the banking sector, putting it at the service of the national economy. Portugal needs a public banking system which finances an increase in national production and a programme of reindustrialisation, a fundamental tool for creating employment with rights, increasing salaries, reducing dependence on other countries, and thereby resolving the problems of deficit and public debt.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is not a tragedy; it is an out and out massacre. That is why I wanted us to keep this title because, with 78 people injured and 34 dead among the striking miners, I would call that a massacre.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we find a little upsetting is the fact that this has happened in a friendly country, which fought hard against apartheid, and the fact that South Africa was, up to a point, a sort of model. However, even with friendly countries, even with model countries, we must be able to tell the truth. Moreover, I think that President Zuma understands this. Today, he is leading an investigation, which started off very badly, I admit, because initially it was the miners, who were striking against unacceptable working conditions, who were accused of assassination. However, I think all of that is now back on track.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I am calling on Europe to do, in its relations with African countries, is to look very closely at the corporate social responsibility of the companies working there. In this sense, we feel somewhat responsible for what has happened in South Africa.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that we should condemn such a blatant violation of human rights and such an outburst of violence, which serve as a reminder for South Africa of the darkest days of its history.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to highlight the fact that today, South Africa, which is often lauded as a model of democracy, has an opportunity to show us that it is capable of applying the fundamental principles of this democracy, namely, impartial justice and respect for the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore pleased that a committee of inquiry has been established in order to shed light on the tragic events of 16 August, but it seems to me that it is essential that we also condemn the use of common purpose law, a throwback to apartheid, which has only served to crystallise the anger in the country a little more.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In South Africa, as in many African states, the wealth of mineral resources is in stark contrast to the rising poverty of part of the population. This part of the population, which is crying out for change, with the fall of the apartheid regime, is, on the contrary, seeing growing social inequalities and a new economic apartheid take root.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The sharing of natural resources remains a key issue on the African continent, and multinationals must shoulder their responsibilities in the current conflicts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why Europe must promote another kind of economic and human development in these regions, by stopping imports of mining products extracted without social or environmental guarantees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would add that this situation should give us cause to reflect, because in South Africa, as in other countries around the world, democracy does not simply mean free elections, but also more social justice.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is almost two decades now since the end of apartheid and the first democratic elections in South Africa, and that country has made great strides. As Africa’s largest economy, it has benefited from the huge rise in demand for commodities and minerals, particularly gold. It has also exercised an important leadership role in African politics, although sadly not in respect of its neighbour, Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the recent massacre of miners by South African police reflects the country’s inherent instability. The police force is sadly bereft of adequate training, equipment and non-lethal crowd control methods such as water cannon. There should be a full investigation now, with no impunity for the perpetrators.</p>
      <p sl="en">I extend, on behalf of my group, the ECR, sympathy to the relatives of those who died and also to those survivors and witnesses who were scandalously later charged with murder. Thankfully, the government has now backed down on this. But Julius Malema, the former youth leader of the ANC, is exploiting this terrible tragedy to whip up anti-government sentiment with his incendiary and violent rhetoric. He is a great threat to the fledgling democracy of South Africa and, therefore, the stability of the entire region.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will not hold it against you. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left was going to be in third place for once. It does not matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The end of apartheid and the coming into power of Nelson Mandela in 1994 held a great deal of hope for the whole world. However, 15 years later, for thousands of South Africans, the hope of emancipation is far from becoming a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After several years of self-sufficiency, South Africa has become involved in globalisation and wanted to integrate into the global capitalist economy, but at what price? More than 50% of South Africans share less than 8% of the country’s income, while 10% have a monopoly over 58% of its wealth. There is no need to tell you which group is white and which is black. Yes, there is economic apartheid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of this comes at a price and this summer’s strike in the Marikana gold mines, where thousands of miners, both black and white, gathered together, was an indicator of this social failure. The unprecedented violence with which the South African police responded, killing dozens of people, is totally unacceptable, as is the legal repression that followed and hit the miners themselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The political authorities, and particularly President Zuma, seem to have reacted since then. We can only welcome this and encourage them to pursue this process, but let us not forget that this was not an isolated incident and that, in 2010 alone, police violence led to 858 deaths.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, opening fire on striking miners and killing 34 people, while wounding 78, as happened on 16 August 2012, was a tragic failure on the part of the South African authorities to contain a mass protest. This terrible error of judgment has led to further demonstrations and hampered the achievement of a compromise. The striking miners have rejected the peace accord that was signed last week between the labour unions and the Lonmin Mining Company.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a course of events requires the South African Government first to conduct an independent investigation into the killings, but also to reform the labour dispute mechanisms to meet the workers’ expectations of social justice.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Republic of South Africa is an exceptional country. On the one hand, it is the most developed country in the region and it can have a positive effect on many neighbouring countries. On the other hand, it is exceptional in the developed world in that there is probably no country in the world that is as dangerous as South Africa. For years, people have been leaving the country for reasons of safety. Those who used to be the victims of the apartheid system are also leaving the country. There is no doubt that the tragic events at the Marikana mine should encourage the South African authorities to take decisive action. It is not just a question of providing an honest explanation of the direct causes of the tragedy and identifying the people responsible, although this is, of course, important. Over the long term, it will be more important to neutralise the structural causes of such a sudden outbreak of violence. The paradox is that, in the opinion of some experts, the differences between rich and poor have been greater since the fall of apartheid. One can identify what is responsible for this phenomenon: corruption, hypocrisy and a lack of the right policies. South Africa faces the risk that populism and nationalism may be used as a medicine for its present troubles. We hope that this does not happen to South Africa.</p>

      <p sl="en">We must await the outcome of the judicial inquiry but, more importantly, we must remove the root causes of this tragedy and the unrest. They are socio-economic causes and they must be dealt with. We must also, as Mr Tannock rightly said, contribute in conjunction with our South African partners to improving policing capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">As to the reason that I have not co-signed the motion – and I did negotiate this – it is because I objected to the word ‘massacre’ in the title. I think it jumps to conclusions; I think it jumps to a conclusion on what the judicial inquiry is undertaking and it is an emotive and subjective view.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, extreme poverty, high socio-economic differences between the vast majority of people who live in poverty and the small wealthy elite naturally generate social tensions in South Africa. The events at the Marikana Lonmin mine, which happened in August this year, provide direct proof of this.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The violent and brutal crackdown by police units taking action against striking miners cost dozens of lives and dozens more were injured. The large-scale arrests of miners led to widespread protests by miners being held in other areas as well.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The fact that the Lonmin mining company failed to engage in dialogue with its employees on working conditions in a civilised manner suggests that multinational corporations operating in this country do not appreciate human labour and do not seek to provide decent conditions for their employees.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Our requirement for a thorough inquiry into these events, as well as access to justice for victims and the right to compensation, is the absolute minimum of what we need to accomplish.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there has been a concerted attempt in the international media to confuse this issue and to suggest that what is at question here is a complicated dispute between trade unions. There is nothing complicated here whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="en">Workers were engaged in a justified strike for higher wages and for better working conditions. They were mown down by the police, some of them shot in the back while running away, with the police acting as private security guards for the mines. The evidence suggests that this massacre was premeditated. The attempt to charge the miners’ colleagues with their murder, which has thankfully been dropped, indicates how far to the right the government of the African National Congress has been driven under Jacob Zuma.</p>
      <p sl="en">The betrayal of those who made the revolution against apartheid is personified by Cyril Ramaphosa. This former leading member of the NUM, still a leading member of the ANC, sits on Lonmin’s board and is a major shareholder. Earlier this year, he bid ZAR 19.5 million for a prize buffalo, whereas the average South African earns around ZAR 26 000 per year. While a tiny elite have enriched themselves, grinding poverty and exploitation continue for the mass of black South Africans.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the previous violent protests, in which 10 people lost their lives, the brutal violent hostilities between the police and striking miners in Marikana on 6 August, in which 34 people were killed and 78 injured, some seriously, are the bloodiest since the end of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
      <p sl="de">An escalation of this kind is to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. However, the unrest in the preceding period and also the events themselves are the result of the major social disparities within the country and should lead to greater discussion about the causes. By the same token, the developments leading up to this incident indicate that better crisis management is urgently necessary, especially for the forces responsible for security. The loss of confidence in the security forces can only be overcome through the maximum possible amounts of transparency, impartiality and fair legal processes.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, as a result of constant and recurring evidence of corruption, there is reason to fear a loss of legitimacy among the people for the established social partners. The South African Government therefore needs to take suitable steps to decisively tackle the extensive consequences, but more than anything also the causes. Better training for the security forces and training in de-escalation, a better legal framework for disputes between the social partners and courageous explanation that is transparent and fair are what is needed at the moment, and we should support our South African partners in this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recent events at the Marikana mine should not be regarded as an isolated incident only, or as some kind of legacy of colonialism or apartheid: they are a symptom of deeply-rooted and widespread disappointment and discontent. We should urge the South African leadership to make sure that it delivers on its promises to its people and makes every effort to reduce the social gap.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that the pressure points and weaknesses in South Africa are increased poverty, lack of inclusive growth, labour questions, unemployment and so on, and South Africa needs to shift its focus to the implementation of its good policy planning and analysis, as the World Bank’s President Jim Yong Kim put it on his recent visit to South Africa.</p>

I believe that Julius Malema has exceeded his role as negotiator and is now taking advantage of the social unrest to flex his political muscle. I regard his call for an illegal general strike in all mines in South Africa as an incitement to violence.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as has been said, this is an appalling tragedy – 34 killed and ten prior to that, including police officers – but I think it is a symptom of how difficult it is to make the transition from a culture of violence to a democratic situation. For that reason, we probably have to look at it in the light of what we have seen in other countries. Nevertheless, obviously all human life is sacred; any death is terrible, and murder in particular has to be condemned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think there are three things we can probably do at European Union level. At a higher level, we could help the government to make sure that the growing wealth of South Africa is distributed fairly. Secondly, we could put pressure on the business community, in particular, to ensure that the companies involved carry out their social responsibilities. Also, the trade union leadership internationally could help rival trade unions to conduct their businesses according to international trade union norms.</p>

      <p sl="fi">What, therefore, should be done? In my opinion, the EU must now call for a thorough investigation into the matter. The EU cannot just decide to demand that others do something: in my view, Baroness Ashton, as an expert on foreign affairs, must also provide assistance.

The ten-member inter-ministerial committee appointed by President Zuma is providing assistance and support to the families of the deceased and is trying to find solutions to the instability of the mining industry.

As regards this situation, I support the initiative of the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the facts leading to these extreme acts of violence and I express my confidence that all those responsible will be held accountable for their actions. Lives that were lost represent an irreparable damage. There are important steps that can be made in order to avoid the recurrence of such a situation ever again. The South African authorities should make robust and consistent effort to strengthen the rule of law and human rights, to ensure equality and to eradicate corruption, which I believe can contribute in important ways to the socio-economic development of the country.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Burma has surprised the world in the past two years, moving dramatically away from military-governed authoritarianism and towards greater openness and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this commendable development should not distract us from the plight of the Rohingya Muslim minority. Rohingyas have lived in Burma for centuries, yet they suffer from institutionalised discrimination and have had terrible violence directed at them in recent years. They are amongst the poorest and most marginalised of the country’s 48 million people. Indeed many Rohingyas have escaped Burma or tried to flee. There are some 300 000 Rohingya refugees living in neighbouring Bangladesh, which is a very poor country and ill-equipped to handle this influx and provide even the most basic assistance, but they do their very best. The border is an open one with no formal crossings in the jungle areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I commend the efforts of the Burmese Government on behalf of my group, the ECR, to try to end the violence directed against Rohingyas, but it is time now for the authorities in Rangoon to move from words to action. In the long term, this means building an inclusive society based on dialogue and genuine democracy, the rule of law and equal rights for all Burmese people. This is not the first time in this Parliament that we have debated the fate of the Rohingya people in Burma, but I sincerely hope it will be the last.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, following the incident in May, violence between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya minority has once again flared up in Burma. Systematic, state-led discrimination against the Rohingya Muslims has not gone away, even though civil liberties have been extended since President Thein Sein’s rise to power in spring 2011. Political prisoners in the country have now been released.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now we are talking about hundreds of dead representatives of the Rohingya minority and tens of thousands of them who have been driven away from their homes. The conflict has gone on for hundreds of years. President Sein needs to be sent a strong message that we will by no means turn a blind eye to the treatment of this minority and how these people are being forced to leave their homes. Civil rights and freedoms must apply to everyone living in Burma, regardless of faith and background. This is not a political request: I want to remind Burma of its obligations under international law.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, since 2011, the Burmese authorities have given several signs of opening up. It was not difficult, considering where we started, but let us not be fooled. The inter-religious violence which hit the region of Arakan and, in particular, the repression that followed, are unacceptable. They show, once more, the situation of the Rohingya minority, one of the most persecuted groups on the planet, according to the UN.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 12 July, President Thein Sein himself had the nerve to declare that the only solution for putting an end to the violence was to expel the Rohingyas and, since the beginning of August, the Dacca authorities have expelled three charities coming to their aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I will simply paraphrase a representative from Human Rights Watch. How would the international community have reacted to the supposed changes? It seems to be blinded by the signing of trade agreements and continues to lift sanctions, even when abusive practices continue. That speaks for itself.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Muslim minorities, especially the Rohingya Muslims, has become steadily more difficult in Burma. The situation became critical at the start of June, when a crowd of Buddhists killed ten Muslims in revenge for the alleged rape of a Buddhist girl. According to international sources, some Burmese Buddhist monks are intentionally stirring up tensions between religious groups, and Muslims are a particular target. The Rohingyas have lived in Burma for centuries, but the military junta stripped them of citizenship in 1982. Nor do they belong to any of the 135 or so legally recognised ethnic minorities in the country.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The roughest estimates suggest that we will soon have a case of genocide on our hands. Although, recently, we have had encouraging and good news from Burma, it is quite clear that the international community must not turn a blind eye to the situation. We have to remember that these processes of change are only in their infancy. The international community needs to focus attention on this case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the government of Burma has started along the tremendous and important path towards opening up. It has granted political freedoms, released nearly all its political prisoners and successfully negotiated ceasefires with nearly all the ethnic groups. It is therefore all the more contradictory and alarming that discrimination against the Rohingya minority should be increasing and that this has progressed as far as extreme and open violence, with deaths, injuries, internally displaced people and refugees. A state of emergency has even been declared in some places. We discussed this intensively in the Subcommittee on Human Rights in July, and our demands can also be seen in today’s resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the one hand, those responsible for this unrest must be punished. Action must be taken. On the other hand, however, the government and all the political forces in Burma must find the courage and the political will to address the fundamental causes and find solutions. In that connection, it is absolutely necessary that the Rohingyas should be given the prospect of citizenship. The necessary statutory framework for this must be created. Citizenship is very important. It provides the right to live as citizens in a multicultural state with the same rights and obligations. The EU should demand that the government of Burma does this, and put itself at their disposal to help in any way it can in respect of how something like that is done.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are still significant long-term challenges in Burma despite the fact that 2011 saw some unexpected and positive political developments. But it is too soon to relax, especially regarding Rohingya Muslims and the Rakhine Buddhists. The President of Burma should not be cherry-picking with respect to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Europe, twenty years ago, we saw the terrible nightmare of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. The fact that Burma is 5 000 miles away in Asia is not an excuse to ignore what amounts to ethnic cleansing in western Burma today.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, although the Burmese Government took several promising steps recently in order to facilitate the democratisation of the country, we can see that discrimination against a single community can lead to a bloodbath and can call into question the country’s actual commitment to reforms. I therefore believe that the resolution adopted by Parliament today is very important, as it sends a clear message to the Burmese Government.

Respect for human and minority rights is part of what constitutes a democratic system of government.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the rape and murder of a young Buddhist girl in the province of Arakan, in Burma, on 28 May, set off a tide of violence and ethnic conflict between Buddhists and Muslims. The battles, which spread throughout the country, forced the President to announce a state of emergency on 10 June. However, instead of stopping the violence and providing protection to both ethnic groups, the security forces have either taken an active part in the conflict or else remained totally passive. In the conflict, at least 80 people have died, 5 000 houses have been burned and 90 000 people have been displaced.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Burma is one of the most ethnically varied countries in Asia and its government is having to deal with existing tensions while complying with the democratic principles that it has undertaken to respect. It should provide access to humanitarian assistance for the wounded and those in need and to those without food, shelter and medicines, and it should also end the discrimination against the Muslim minority by granting them full civil rights.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Rohingya Muslims are one of the world’s most persecuted minorities and, although the human rights situation in Burma has improved otherwise, the situation with regard to the Rohingya minority has only worsened.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Furthermore, what is astonishing about this case, at least as far as I am concerned, is that the human rights activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, someone who is celebrated and greatly respected throughout the world and in her country too, has kept completely silent regarding this matter. All the same, this is a violation of human rights that is happening in her country. One would think that she, as someone who enjoys such prestige, could and would want to say something about it, so that the situation might improve.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, although the Burmese Government has implemented a series of measures over the past years to extend civil liberties, resulting at least in the freeing of political prisoners, it is still taking action that is inconsistent with respect for human rights. One such area is the treatment by the authorities of the Rohingya minority in Arakan state. A failure to recognise the rights of this ethnic group and the treatment of these people as illegal immigrants or stateless persons equates to clear discrimination within Burmese society, and it was this kind of treatment which recently led to a massacre. These events have also resulted in a humanitarian crisis in the whole region. In addition to restoring order, it is vital to conduct a reliable investigation into the violence, to take steps towards national unification, and to make constant efforts for a return to stability and democracy in the country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, arbitrary arrests of Rohingya should stop. I would expect the Burmese authorities to decide to cooperate fully with United Nations agencies. Assistance from European diplomacy would also appear to be necessary. A review of citizenship rights and extending them to the Muslim minority is a fundamental political step that the Burmese Government must now take. The issue of freedom of public information is a separate question. Journalists in Burma are still monitored by a government agency and barely 1% of the population has access to the Internet. This situation must change as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the issue of breaches of human rights in Burma is once again the subject of public debate. The eyes of various international organisations are on the religious conflict between Muslims and Buddhists living in Burmese territories. Statements from the authorities there are trying to deflect attention from the current situation, saying that the problem is an internal issue and should not be publicised in the international arena.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Rohingya, who are a Muslim ethnic minority, live in the northern part of the Burmese state of Arakan. Even though they number 800 000 people, the authorities do not recognise them as an ethnic minority and many Burmese see them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Thus, the Muslim Rohingya are in no-man’s-land, since Bangladesh does not want them back. According to reports by Amnesty International, they are subject to various types of extortion, their lands are confiscated and they are forced to move and to carry out forced labour on the roads or in military camps. Such practices, leaving aside the breaches of their other fundamental human rights, are discriminatory against this population. The European Union should help Burma by becoming actively involved in cooperation to implement social, political and economic reforms.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we have observed this week a new incident, a new victim in the global inter-ethnic war, with the killing of the US ambassador in Benghazi, an event mentioned at the start of this sitting in our Parliament, which has always supported the fight for fundamental freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, however, bloody anarchy tends to provoke just as much evil as a repressive dictatorship. This is why I would like to highlight the cause of the inter-ethnic clashes and the excessive intervention by the Burmese forces of law and order. Three men belonging to the Rohingya minority raped and killed a woman belonging to the Buddhist community. This was followed by the death of more than 80 people in fighting in Rakhine State between Buddhists and Muslims.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on the Burmese authorities to recognise the Rohingya minority and to make efforts to integrate them and defuse the humanitarian crisis. The balance of establishing democracy and carrying out reforms in Burma is closely linked to the cessation of inter-ethnic hostilities in this country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, clearly, the events of the past months have been shocking, and the extent of violence suffered by the Rohingya Muslim community in Burma/Myanmar has repulsed people into reaction. But there has been a complete lack of reaction from one quarter. It has absolutely amazed me that the very person in whom we have vested so much trust to uphold our values, Aung San Suu Kyi, to the extent that we have put pictures of her in our parliamentary building in Brussels, remains completely silent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aung San Suu Kyi, these are your people. They have been displaced, they have been killed, they have been raped, they have been tortured – and from you we have nothing but silence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We call for an immediate end to that violence. We call for immediate access to humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation, the return of those people to their homes and the immediate restitution of their property. The authorities need to know that they have to protect the Rohingya people. President Thein Sein has to receive that message clearly. He has to grant them nationality and uphold their human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recent violent clashes between Rohingya Muslim and ethnic Rakhine communities in Burma are not a result of any single act, but of persistent neglect by the central government and failure to address ethnic tensions in the northern Rakhine State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Various accounts of people killed, injured or displaced paint an extremely distressing picture. In order to find a viable solution to the conflict, the Burmese authorities must secure stability in the region, end unequal treatment of the Rohingyas and make efforts for reconciliation. Recognition of Rohingyas as an indigenous ethnic group would contribute to starting a constructive dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would just like to say a few words to support what some of my colleagues have said, especially my colleague, Ms Lochbihler.</p>
      <p sl="en">Neither the government nor the political opposition have taken a clear public stance in defence of the victims. We must thus express our appreciation for those Burmese citizens who have raised their voice in support of the Muslim minority and the pluralistic society. It is imperative that the Burmese authorities stop arbitrary arrests of Rohingya, provide information about the whereabouts of hundreds of people detained since security operations in Rakhine State began in June, and immediately release those arbitrarily arrested.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, there is also an urgent need for the government of Burma to provide the UN agencies and humanitarian non-governmental organisations unhindered access to all areas of Rakhine State and guarantee unrestricted access to humanitarian aid for all affected populations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the violence which broke out last May between Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State was indeed tragic. It led to loss of life, damage to property, including schools, and places of worship and, at its peak, 100 000 people were driven from their homes.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was all the more disappointing since the remarkable changes in Myanmar have so far been peaceful. Moreover, it highlighted the plight of the Rohingyas and the ingrained prejudice against them going back to colonial times. Our concern is finding a better future for the Rohingyas in the new Myanmar. For many years, the EU has supported stateless and deprived Rohingya in northern Rakhine State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2007, ECHO has spent about EUR 24 million for that purpose. In their conclusions in April, EU Foreign Ministers recalled the need to clarify the legal status and improve the welfare of the Rohingya population.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the High Representative/Vice President, I therefore welcome the willingness of the government to listen to the concerns of the international community, as expressed by the Border Affairs Minister in recent contacts with EU diplomats in Myanmar. He has invited the UN Country Team and international diplomats to a dialogue on this matter later this month at a workshop in the capital Nay Pyi Taw.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government should have the space to deal with the situation as an internal matter, but there are external implications since it affects our interests and values and shapes Myanmar’s image abroad. Thus, in ongoing contacts with the government, the High-Representative/Vice-President has passed on the following messages:</p>
      <p sl="en">First, we expect Myanmar to adhere to international standards as regards human rights, citizenship and treatment of detainees. Second, humanitarian access should continue to be improved, particularly in areas of northern Rakhine State, where interventions have been suspended due to the violence. Some 60 000 people still remain in temporary camps. As made clear by ECHO, the EU is ready and willing to help all those who have been affected by the violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government has allowed official visits by the international community, including the EU, to Rakhine State. That was most welcome, to establish facts and a common understanding of the challenges ahead. But more could be done to help counter negative perceptions, for example, through access for local and international media. The government has publicly stated that the solution has to lie inside Myanmar. Both communities have to learn again how to peacefully coexist alongside each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">The President’s establishment of the independent Rakhine Investigation Commission with a mandate to propose medium- and long-term solutions is a step in this direction. The Commission is due to report by mid-November 2012. We hope this report will be made public. A permanent separation of the communities should be avoided; a solution must involve finding ways of reintegrating both communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government should reach out to civil society and dialogue to build bridges between the communities in the context of an inclusive, common Myanmar identity. Bearing in mind the large number of the Rohingya in Bangladesh and worries about the refugees in the camps, we hope that the two governments will soon begin talking to each other about how to bring things forward.</p>

      <p sl="fi">We have witnessed the struggle headed by Aung San Suu Kyi and the huge steps taken towards a more democratic Burma. One major human rights problem, however, has remained, and Burma’s Muslim minority has been in many of the headlines in recent weeks. The incidents of violence between Buddhists and the Rohingya Muslims began in June in the west of Burma, when a group of Muslim men were accused of raping and murdering a Buddhist girl, and 10 Muslims were killed as a result. Since then, violence has increased on both sides, but the Rohingyas have been on the receiving end, and journalists have reported that Burmese security forces may have even encouraged violence against Muslims, or at least pretended not to notice it. The United Nations describes the Rohingya Muslims as one of the world’s most persecuted ethnic groups. Diplomatic sources and human rights groups are worried that this same population of 800 000 living in western Burma is the ‘blind spot’ of a country that is moving towards a more democratic society, one on which even Aung San Suu Kyi has barely adopted a position. Although the Rohingya Muslims have lived in Burma for generations, they have been denied the opportunity to obtain Burmese citizenship. They must ask for permission to get married or to have more than two children, and they must inform the authorities if they want to travel outside their village. These restrictions were originally imposed by Burma’s military government in 1982. These laws, which trample on human rights, should now be repealed as soon as possible. This should be just one of the vital steps towards a democratic society that Burma has taken in recent years.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group regards the granting of a pardon by President Aliyev, and the hero’s welcome given to Ramil Safarov immediately after his return home to Azerbaijan, as deplorable.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is contrary to the reported diplomatic understanding by Hungary, where he lived because he was convicted and serving a life sentence in prison for carrying out the brutal murder of an Armenian citizen. It is also against the spirit of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which is supposed to mean that returned prisoners serve out their sentences in their home country in order to be closer to their families and in their home culture and language.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although what was done was, strictly speaking, legally permitted within the laws of Azerbaijan, politically it sends all the wrong signals to Armenia by escalating tensions in an already fraught situation. Azerbaijan is a member of the Council of Europe and participates in Euronest, the EU Eastern Partnership and various other bodies, like the OSCE, which all purport to uphold democratic values and human rights. Clearly, this case is illustrative of the increasingly bellicose attitude taken by Baku over the Nagorno-Karabakh territorial dispute.</p>
      <p sl="en">Renewed efforts must now be made by the European Union, through the Minsk Group, to try to resolve this frozen conflict and establish a long and lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan and allow the whole of the South Caucasus to develop and prosper.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I share many of the views expressed by Mr Tannock on the shocking way in which Azerbaijan has pardoned and promoted Ramil Safarov.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I would like to explain the position of my group. We have kept our signature at the bottom of this compromise resolution, but we have one question: if Hungary agreed to return Mr Safarov to Azerbaijan, it seems that it must have received assurances that his sentence would still be served, and that has not been the case. Why is the Hungarian Government not strongly protesting today?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have therefore called, in our resolution, for an amendment, which is very prudent with regard to the Hungarian Government, and which simply says that its attitude is a little surprising and foolhardy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will approve the resolution on the condition that this amendment is adopted, because I think that this is a game of three halves.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the resolution before us today is one of these texts on which we have had rather surreal negotiations. For reasons that I fail to understand, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has withdrawn its signature.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet the facts speak for themselves. The Hungarian Government has given in to the age-old pressures of the Azerbaijani authorities by agreeing to transfer Ramil Safarov, who committed an horrific crime against a young Armenian lieutenant, Gurgen Margaryan, and who was sentenced to life imprisonment for this crime. When he arrived in his own country, Mr Safarov was considered a national hero and was immediately pardoned and even rewarded. Relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia certainly did not need this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union should not allow one of its Member States to act in this manner: adding fuel to the fire instead of entering into negotiation efforts, as others have, in order to finally find a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am not as diplomatic as Ms De Keyser, and I would say that unfortunately, we are used to seeing Mr Orbán only showing concern for the values and positions of the European Union when it suits him.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, the story of today’s debate has three actors: Azerbaijan, Armenia and Hungary, and it runs along two courses: a legal and a political course. Out of the three actors, the role of Hungary is marginal, as it was merely following the norms of international law. In the light of this, I find the motions for amendment submitted by the left-wing puzzling, as they are heating up a frozen conflict in order to condemn Hungary. One could say that this is a well-known left-wing technique of obfuscation. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, clearly violated the spirit of the rules by immediately granting a pardon to the returned Mr Safarov.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is not surprising for Armenia to attack Azerbaijan, but the anti-Hungarian outbursts are an indication of a heated state of emotions. The reason why all this is alarming is that the overexcited reaction on the part of Armenia and the questionable step taken by Azerbaijan explicitly endanger the already unstable security of the region.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I will admit that the letter of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons was respected, but the spirit was not.

      <p sl="hu">Blue-card question. – I have two short questions. Mr Schöpflin made a distinction between the legal and political aspects here; I would be curious as to the motivation behind this. Hungary’s previous governments resisted this request and this pressure for years, for the very reason that we were aware that if we gave in, we would be intervening in a very delicate situation. So we did not give in. Beyond the issue of guarantees, which Ms De Keyser enquired about for the very reason that contradictory statements had been issued at home, my question is whether there had been any preparations for this. If you did not prepare for this, was it because you had laid off everyone in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who would have known what was going on in the region? Or was it perhaps because you did not ask for the opinion of the Ministry of Foreign affairs or decided to not take it into account?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we have just been hearing, this urgent human rights matter relates to a case that mingles several levels. It involves the unresolved conflict and the current stalemate in the peace process on Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding occupied territories, as well as an act of a brutal personal revenge in the form of a pre-meditated murder and the deplorable glorification of a murderer. It also involves the economic crisis in the new EU Member State and irresponsible acts by Heads of Government and State respectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us start at the beginning. Mr Safarov, as we have heard, was transferred to Azerbaijan from Hungary long before his sentence was completed. The European Parliament strongly condemns that. He was granted a presidential pardon by President Aliyev there, and he has been honoured as a national hero and promoted to major in the Azeri military. All despite the fact that he has not repented of the brutal murder of an Armenian soldier that he committed in Budapest in 2004.</p>
      <p sl="en">I acknowledge the legitimate frustration in Azerbaijan about the lack of substantial progress in the peace process, but acts of brutal revenge, and turning murderers into national heroes, is an appalling way of reacting and risks further escalating – not just rhetorically – the ethnic conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Mr Schöpflin, Hungary has not played a merely marginal role in that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us look at Hungary. Hungary’s Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, has a huge share of responsibility here. Just at the beginning of this week, he admitted that he himself gave way and said ‘yes’ to transferring Safarov back to Baku, that he ignored the warnings from his own administration, and that he himself – that is the interpretation – is responsible for heating up the conflict in the Caucuses.</p>
      <p sl="en">This brave admission gives rise to the interpretation that, following his recent visit to Baku, Mr Orbán knowingly and deliberately helped to pardon a murderer, and sacrificed diplomatic relations with Armenia for a highly questionable economic deal to help his own country out of the crisis. I hope our amendments on Hungary will also be put to the vote here, because we have to be critical both of the Azeri President and of the Hungarian Prime Minister.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, a French minister recently made derogatory remarks about the Roma community in Romania. I feel a sense of indignation, but my indignation cannot give rise to an emergency resolution.

According to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure, this situation cannot give rise to an emergency resolution. It is not a matter concerning the rules of law, democracy or human rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Raising this matter in the relations between two countries, when we all acknowledge that this involved a completely legal agreement and both sides, Hungary and Azerbaijan, respected each other’s rights, may cause a sense of indignation, but cannot give rise to a political resolution in a circumstance where the security situation in the region might be affected to a fair extent by promoting such actions.</p>

The absence of any results after 20 years of work indicates that the Minsk Group needs a reshuffle. In order to find a balance in the negotiation process, France should be reinforced by the European Union, which, in my view, has an historic chance to try to resolve this very frozen conflict, showing its knowledge and experience in negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament remains committed to the developments in the South Caucasus, and its Member States are aware of the huge potential of Azerbaijan. The constructive partnership between Brussels and Baku entails reciprocity and commitment to shared values.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the resolutions that we debate here usually deal with things that happen outside Europe’s borders, but we also have to discuss what happened in Hungary. The focus is nevertheless on the fact that, when people are transferred, it is usually agreed that they will remain in prison. After a number of years, they then often get the chance to be pardoned or released.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In this case, it was decided on day one to honour a murderer as a kind of hero and reward him financially in order to exacerbate the conflict. There can be no purpose to this other than to foster hatred and exacerbate the conflict. It seems as though they have succeeded in doing this. That is why it is important now for us to help Armenia and Azerbaijan to achieve a peaceful solution to the conflict and to ensure that this type of policy of hatred cannot benefit in any way those who pursue it.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the release of the murderer sentenced to life imprisonment by the Azerbaijani President in August this year was shocking news for the civilised world.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In doing so, Ilham Aliyev indirectly told his citizens and the world that any citizen of Azerbaijan who murders an Armenian shall be a hero in his eyes, and he would be exalted and rewarded for such a murder. The Azerbaijani President thus behaves like a mafia boss who rewards his stooges for the murder of his enemies.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should note that a sense of frustration hangs over Azerbaijan due to the occupation of Azerbaijani territories by the Armenian military. However, Ramil Safarov murdered his Armenian colleague during a course being held as part of the Partnership for Peace programme held in Budapest, and not somewhere on a battlefield in the border zone.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I do not wish to comment on the professionalism of the Hungarian administration which permitted this criminal to return home, but I understand the actions of the Armenian Government, which broke off diplomatic relations with Hungary. I firmly believe, however, that our generous accommodating policy towards Azerbaijan is not conducive to the cultivation of a political environment in that country and, in the future, we should be more cautious in our expectations that the Armenian and Azerbaijani governments might agree on a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the statement made by the European Parliament on the Ramil Safarov case is, in my opinion, very appropriate. The support expressed for the mediators in the peace process between Armenia and Azerbaijan is of fundamental importance, I believe.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I discern in the wording of the resolution, however, a rebuke for an EU Member State over the failure of its diplomats and legislators to foresee the presidential pardon, or rather for seeing it as a way of getting rid of a problem. As the President of Azerbaijan clearly did not have much of an option, the reaction of the Armenians who suspect Budapest of doing a deal is not to be wondered at. On the other hand, I would expect a promise that the European Parliament will help to settle relations between Armenia and Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Most welcome of all would be for the European Parliament to actively join in with the states seeking a peaceful resolution to the disputes over Nagorno-Karabakh. I would like to say that many Member States export large volumes of arms and ammunition to this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, punish or extradite? This is the fundamental principle of international criminal law in matters of mutual cooperation in criminal justice matters between states. In this case, Hungary used a combination of these two. We enforced eight years of Mr Safarov’s sentence and then extradited him – at the request of Azerbaijan – and allowed his transfer to Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a criminal lawyer, I think there should have been more careful consideration in terms of making sure that Azerbaijan did not use Article 12 of the relevant European Convention and did not grant a pardon or amnesty to Safarov. As a Hungarian criminal lawyer, I am not proud of this particular decision, and I think there is room for improvement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having said that, the European Union is not a role model for us. The European Union should not instruct us in matters of international cooperation in criminal cases when there is a shameful, shocking case pending in the European Union in which we are on the receiving end of a miscarriage of justice, and you had better solve that case before you instruct us. It is the Tobin case. Have you ever heard about this case? If not, that is really sad; you should have heard about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">An Irish banker in Hungary killed two Hungarian children in an extreme case of reckless driving. He was sentence to three years’ imprisonment by a Hungarian court. He is now in Ireland, in his country of citizenship, and do you know what? Ireland refuses both to extradite him to Hungary and to enforce his sentence. What does the European Union do? It sits back and keeps silent. Why is it that when we are on the receiving end of these miscarriages of justice, you never raise your voices? Ms Hall said earlier this afternoon that there should be no cherry picking in matters of human rights. Please use this principle when Hungary is on the agenda.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Council of Europe and of the Eastern Partnership, Azerbaijan needs to heed its freely undertaken commitments in respect of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the Safarov case. International treaties and agreements absolutely have to be complied with. The EU should support Azerbaijan in realising these aspirations as far as is possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am committed to ensuring that the EU intensifies its efforts to mediate in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, thus getting involved and helping to bring peace to the region. Active participation and political will on the part of both the Azerbaijanis and the Armenians are a prerequisite for this. Talks have to be held in this regard at the highest political level, while broader civil society must also be involved at the same time. The European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Commission must work closely with the local, regional, national and international actors on the ground in order to obtain synergies. For me, the question arises as to whether it is helpful to look to lay blame at the door of the Hungarian Government, or whether we do not instead need to be very clear in what we say to the Azerbaijani Government.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, as parliamentarians, we have been under quite a lot of pressure to abandon this resolution. I cannot quite understand the view of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that we should not say anything about this issue, because it is extremely important, given the unrest in that region. Furthermore, this is an urgent matter and we should specifically endeavour to say something that will ease the situation there.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Hungarian Government has posted a statement on its website to the effect that Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Justice had assured Hungary that Safarov would continue to serve the remaining part of his sentence in Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, that was not the case and, instead, he was pardoned and promoted, and he became a sort of national hero. It is extremely important that we condemn the way in which Safarov was treated in Azerbaijan. We must also do everything to ensure that relations between the countries in the region, Armenia and Azerbaijan, are restored peacefully and that neighbourly relations can continue between them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, during an international training course organised in 2004 by NATO in Hungary, an Azeri soldier, Ramil Safarov, killed an Armenian officer with an axe and said that the victim had shown disrespect both to him and to the Azeri flag. Acting in accordance with the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, signed both by Budapest and Baku, Hungary agreed to transfer the prisoner to Azerbaijan. As everyone has said here, Safarov was greeted as a hero, released from the penalty of life imprisonment that had been imposed by Hungary, and he was then promoted for his heroic deed to the rank of major. This incident has aroused considerable and widespread concern. First of all, according to the provisions of the convention on the transfer of sentenced persons, Azerbaijan was under an obligation to ensure that the entire penalty imposed by Hungary was carried out and this it did not do. Secondly, President Aliyev gave the world a very bad example by glorifying a brutal crime and treating the murderer as a national hero. For this reason, I appeal to the Azeri authorities to act in accordance with international standards as regards the justice system.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome your initiative to raise the issue of Mr Safarov’s extradition and pardoning. I am fully aware of the very strong reactions prompted by this development, not only in Armenia, but also far beyond.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ramil Safarov was sentenced in Hungary to life imprisonment for the brutal murder of Gurgen Margaryan, an Armenian officer and fellow NATO course participant. From our contacts with the Hungarian authorities, I understand that the decision to extradite Mr Safarov was based upon written assurances received from the Azerbaijani Government that Mr Safarov would serve the remaining part of his life sentence there.</p>
      <p sl="en">The subsequent Azerbaijani decisions, including the pardoning of Mr Safarov and steps which have widely been seen as rewarding his crime, are deeply regrettable. The handling of this case has the potential to further complicate the peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, as well as – potentially – the Eastern Partnership agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite this setback – and I think we cannot pretend that it is otherwise – the EU remains committed to, and persistent in, its support to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict settlement process in the framework of the Minsk Group. The EU does not see – and would absolutely reject – any alternative to peaceful conflict settlement. The Safarov case should not be used by anyone to deviate from this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Intense contacts with all actors to establish the situation have been deployed by the EU, and there was a good discussion on this at the informal Foreign Ministers’ meeting last weekend in Cyprus. Moreover, Baroness Ashton has instructed the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia to visit Yerevan and Baku and convey our messages, which he is doing as we speak.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, there is also a lesson for the Eastern Partnership, in which both Armenia and Azerbaijan participate. Without a community of values, without the rule of law and respect for human rights and commitments taken, there can be no reconciliation or peace. In this respect, the implementation of the Eastern Partnership Road map becomes a key element for regional stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">More than ever, our efforts in support of peace in the region are needed. The Commission welcomes President Schulz’s statement and the European Parliament’s commitment in focusing the attention of partners on this objective.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The case of Ramil Safarov should be viewed in the wider context of the ever deepening conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Every day, the situation becomes more complicated. The rhetoric on both sides is increasingly aggressive and does not hide the fact that steps are being taken towards an armed conflict. It is enough to mention today’s declaration by the Azeri authorities stating that the visit by the Armenian President to the ‘occupied territories’ of Nagorno-Karabakh would be treated as a hostile act against Baku. Yerevan has been using similar rhetoric: a few months ago came the declaration that, in the coming conflict with Azerbaijan, the Armenian army should create a new frontier with Russia. The main allies of the two parties, Russia and Turkey, are well aware of the situation and have been massing their armies on the border with the Southern Caucasus. The only thing that we can now do is to debate, following another blunder of EU diplomacy, which was to strengthen foreign policy activity in the light of the ‘Arab Spring’ to the detriment of the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea Synergy. The European Union does not play any significant role in this region, which is vital for our energy security. We have handed the area over to Moscow and Ankara, who are not concerned about peace but about extending their territory of influence. What is worse, there are still no signs of any change in the policy conducted by Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In today’s resolution, we have once again had to speak critically about the behaviour of the Azeri Government. It should be noted that this country is in the process of negotiating an association agreement with the EU and is actively involved in the concept of the Eastern Partnership and the Euronest initiative. One might therefore conclude that it aspires to modify its legal order to the order on which the European Union is based. Respect for democracy and the rule of law are fundamental for European integration. The case of Ramil Safarov clearly breaches not just agreements, but also generally accepted standards of international law. It is unimaginable that a person who has been handed down a legally binding sentence of life imprisonment should, immediately following a transfer under the European convention on the transfer of sentenced persons, be pardoned, promoted to the status of a hero and rewarded. While working on diplomatic steps to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, I believe that the European Union cannot remain quiet on the way in which Azerbaijan has behaved, not just publicly glorifying a crime, but also consciously risking an escalation in the conflict.</p>
