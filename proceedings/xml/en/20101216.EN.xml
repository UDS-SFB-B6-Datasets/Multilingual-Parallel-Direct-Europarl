      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Mrs Paliadeli, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union action for the European Heritage Label (COM(2010)0076 - C7-0071/2010 - 2010/0044(COD)) (A7-0311/2010).</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, encouraging a European conscience that respects and defends multiculturalism represents a major challenge to the European institutions in their effort to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity between the citizens of the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">Knowledge of our history, familiarity with our multicultural cultural heritage and information for the young generation about the ideas and people who were at the forefront in building the European Union may help to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Commission has undertaken, on the instructions of the Council of the European Union, to draft a proposal to transform the intergovernmental European Heritage label into a Community institution. Broad public consultation and an impact assessment have illustrated that integrating this institution into European initiatives would help to improve the image and credibility of the label, provided that it is based on clearly predefined criteria and emphasises the symbolic, rather than the aesthetic, nature of a monument or site; in other words, it would make a statement that European history is the result of a rich and mutually complementary common cultural heritage and that the European Union is rooted in strong values, such as freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, cultural diversity, tolerance and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="el">We started with a very ambitious approach to the label; as a weapon in our foreign policy arsenal which would go beyond the borders of the European Union, it could be awarded to other states in Europe and – why not – even outside our continent. For the moment, it would appear to be more realistic for it to be used as a means of deepening cohesion between the Member States of the Union and for it to be restricted initially to its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">We countered the Commission’s proposal that the label should be awarded to a maximum of 27 sites with a proposal that the procedure should be repeated every two years, in order to maintain the value of the institution and allow time for sites to be selected and then monitored, once the label has been awarded. We agree that, because of the symbolic value of the award, as a factor that contributes to European unification, transnational sites need to be favoured, because they support cohesion, promote the creation of networks and encourage cooperation between Member States or regions. That is why they should take first place in the quota. For practical reasons, one Member State will act as coordinator between the European group of experts and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="el">We approached the transformation of the label not as an administrative transformation of the old transnational institution, but as a new institution with clearly defined selection criteria and binding obligations on the part of recipients if they are to keep it. The group of experts, the networking, the symbolic character and the monitoring of the awardees indicate a different approach which should not be confused with the previous transnational institution. That is why, in the aim of safeguarding the old institution and promoting the validity of the new institution, we felt that the transitional provisions in Article 18 in the Commission’s proposal were not needed. We also sought ways of strengthening the role of the twelve-member team of experts in the Commission text by adding another member proposed by the Committee of the Regions, and we tried to ensure the team was more involved in the label award or withdrawal procedure.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the same context, and in order to strengthen the role of the European Parliament, we insisted on the Commission’s obligation to publish a full list of pre-selected sites, before the final selection, and to advise the European Parliament and the Council accordingly. This will give the European Parliament and the Council time to react if any issues arise.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close this brief presentation, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission representatives and the Council for their creative contribution to the report which you will be asked to vote on shortly. I trust that we shall cooperate in the same spirit at the next stage of the consultation.</p>

    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Androulla Vassiliou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament, especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their solid support for the Commission’s proposal on the European Heritage Label. As you know, this proposal was one of the first approved by the new Commission after it had taken office and it is one of our priorities in the cultural sector over the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="el">Our aim, through this label, is to give European citizens, especially young citizens, new opportunities to learn about their common and, at the same time, diverse cultural heritage and history and the development of the European Union. I am certain that this will help to bring European citizens closer to the European Union. The European Heritage Label will also help to increase cultural tourism and will bring physical and financial benefits.</p>
      <p sl="el">Cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on the label has been extremely constructive over recent months and I am delighted that our approach coincided on numerous basic issues. Most of the amendments that you approved today are completely in line with our ambitions for the new label. We share Parliament’s view that the quality and validity of the initiative are of vital importance. We also appreciate the action you have taken to maintain maximum clarity, simplicity and flexibility in the rules and procedures, so that they are easy for the public to understand and for the Member States and the European Union to apply.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, a small number of your amendments are politically more delicate. I refer mainly to the transitional provisions deleted. The sites awarded the intergovernmental label and the Member States have huge expectations of the transitional period, which will give them the opportunity to participate in the new system quickly, provided, of course, that they satisfy the new quality criteria. This is possibly one of the main issues we need to discuss with the Council at our trialogues over coming months.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I am certain that compromises will be found which are acceptable to all sides and which will safeguard the long-term success of the European Heritage Label. That is why we hope to continue his excellent cooperation with Parliament in this sector. Thank you once again for your excellent cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as is only right, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur not only on her work but, most of all, on her ability to listen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report, while it may not appear very important in the overall context of this Parliament, seems to me likely to bring about real Community action. Small streams make great rivers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the Committee on Culture and Education voted to keep the name of ‘European Heritage Label’ – for which the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) was hoping in particular – it is because this initiative is not limited to the period of history of the European Union, but focuses on the grand idea of Europe, a much older concept.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The label is a powerful tool that should primarily promote European identity through cultural diversity. It should not be seen as a simple transformation of the intergovernmental initiative, but rather as a real tool which, based on experience, will bring real added value, both through the impetus it may give to the promotion of European values by Member States or local authorities and in terms of our citizens’ knowledge of these values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Its aim is to strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to Europe, and to help bring about a common awareness. At a time when public attachment to the European idea remains a major challenge we must face, Europe also needs symbols that develop and strengthen it on a daily basis, as unfortunately it would seem that European identity is an obvious fact that is yet to be invented.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I completely agree with all the other speakers that this is an excellent initiative and I am very pleased that the Committee on Culture and Education and Mrs Paliadeli are putting this forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like particularly to thank our rapporteur who has done excellent work on this. It is a very good means of promoting Europe, of promoting our common culture and history. I am sure it will be a huge success and we have put in place various ways of making sure it is successful. The final sites will be chosen by a panel of experts who will have specialist knowledge in this area and, as I have said before, we will particularly be looking at cross-border sites to promote the idea of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also particular criteria that we ask the successful candidates to meet: we want to raise the European significance of the sites chosen; the successful candidates will be expected to organise education events, especially for young people; there will be an exchange of ideas on initiating common projects with other sites awarded the label; there will be artistic and cultural activities which will foster dialogue; and there will be access, of course, for the widest numbers of the public to visit these sites.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I think the sites, when they are up and running, will have a huge benefit for Europe and will be something that people will be able to come to and enjoy, and will promote the idea of Europe and what we in Parliament and the EU are doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I commend this report to you all. I am sure when the scheme is set up and running it will be a huge success and I have been very proud to be part of this initiative.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the European Heritage Label is, without doubt, a very important project, for at least two reasons: firstly, it enables European citizens to feel closer to their common and diverse history and heritage; secondly it is a good tool for promoting cultural tourism and boosting the economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore like to thank Commissioner Vassiliou and the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, for their initiative and their hard work, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that, although initially, it was an initiative by the Member States, we now need to give it a clearly EU dimension.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means that the European Heritage Label should not be the sum of the places selected by the Member States, but rather it should reflect a common European vision. Having a European vision requires common criteria and absolute transparency in the pre-selection process by the Member States. It also means that we must respect regional, cultural and linguistic diversity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Its success depends on us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the promotion and development of heritage sites in Europe is a necessary and welcome project which deserves our full attention. Our rich and diverse cultural heritage is something that the citizens of Europe should be proud of and, indeed, is one of the primary reasons why millions of people from around the world visit Europe every year. The project has the potential to deliver for historical sites the possibility to access additional funding and to preserve and develop their facilities, which is a much needed asset during these tough economic times, but where we raise expectations for citizens, we have the responsibility to deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, from the outset, this report was couched in a federalist language that sought to promote a fake or forced European demos, and the attempt to rename the scheme the European Union Heritage Label was politically based and would exclude thousands of potential locations whose history and heritage predates, and indeed overshadows, many contemporary sites.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, attempts by myself and others to ensure that the focus of the label remained on heritage, and not on political integration, were rejected. This will inevitably lead to the unfair exclusion of many important sites.</p>
      <p sl="en">Funding for this programme also raised serious concerns, especially given the austerity measures currently afflicting culture departments across Europe. I hope that we were able to contain this, going forward. The excessive proliferation of sites and the probable duplication of the UNESCO scheme are also likely to add problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">The central goals of this label should have been to preserve and celebrate our shared and diverse heritage, but unfortunately, we have not guaranteed that we will add value. This is something that we need to be mindful of.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with this initiative, which aims to transform the European Heritage Label into a formal action of the European Union in order to increase its effectiveness, visibility, prestige and credibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">To this end, I should like to emphasise the importance of the professionalism of the members of the panel of experts appointed to evaluate the sites, as well as the rigorousness of the procedures for attribution of the label and reviewing its maintenance as time goes on. These elements are essential to ensure the specificity and quality of the label itself.</p>
      <p sl="it">The label must, however, focus entirely on symbolic and educational value, rather than on the beauty of the site – as other initiatives for the promotion of cultural heritage tend to – so as to clearly differentiate it from these. Therefore, I also agree that transnational sites should be held in particular consideration, in virtue of their symbolic importance.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="4238" name="Hans-Peter Martin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, a label of this kind makes good sense, but only under two conditions: the first is that it should have high visibility to ensure awareness – after all, we already have an abundance of symbols like this. The second condition is that the associated bureaucracy should not be allowed to become an end in itself, as with so many similar initiatives and EU institutions. It really would be a paradox of European cultural tradition if something that could be so beneficial to us, clearly setting out a position quite different from China in the way it deals with its ancient culture, or from the United States with its historically small repository of cultural sites, were to be seen in the final analysis as an extremely bureaucratic and complex way of creating jobs for the boys.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to be quite clear about one thing: culture is the source for the inspiring ideas and visions that are frequently espoused here, but far less frequently put into practice. This particular opportunity to establish an identity that is also encompassed by the principle of subsidiarity, can only exist through culture, which is why we need to do even more in this area. I am also thinking of the specific promotion of writers and other artists, without the self-perpetuating bureaucratic organisations and institutions we tend to have in a European context.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="96843" name="Marco Scurria" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to greet Commissioner Vassiliou and thank her for her strong backing for this initiative, just as I should like to thank Mrs Paliadeli and all the shadow rapporteurs for the good work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe is experiencing economic and financial difficulties at present. Indeed, we are currently discussing how to intervene to help several countries of the European Union that are in difficulty. Obviously, that is an important thing to do, but Europe must not lose sight of the importance of the values that have allowed the Union to emerge victorious from the innumerable challenges it has had to deal with during its history.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe’s wealth lies in its history, its culture, its art, its leading figures, its landscapes, its symbolic places, its intellectuals, its philosophers and – dare I say it – in its civilisation. This label can represent all of this and highlight all the myriad forms of European identity that the Member States have contributed over time.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must now look at the negotiations with the Council to resolve a few differences of interpretation on several points. I believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily, given the importance of this topic. I also believe that as soon as this report is definitively adopted, we shall all feel more European, due to the values and traditions we share. I believe that through the Commission, the work carried out by Parliament and with the Council, we really are doing a good job for all our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am much obliged to Mr Scurria. I greatly appreciate what he had to say on this matter. I would just like to ask him, as a representative of the largest group here in this House, how he would assess the risk that we may get tied up with too much red tape in relation to the administration and implementation of this cultural heritage label? Does he have any proposals for ensuring that this is kept within reasonable parameters, so that we are not faced with a plethora of endlessly deliberating juries and our actual common goal is not missed, namely, a highly visible label that is also recognised accordingly in the media.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I am very happy to respond to Mr Martin because we know that the bureaucracy issue is sometimes what distinguishes and separates European citizens from their institutions. Seen from this point of view, I think the path set out by this report is quite clear. We shall also talk about it with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">Once the Member States have decided which sites the European label could be given to and once we have a panel of true experts coming together, who are given the chance to select the sites within a necessary but not excessive amount of time – and we still need to work out who will have the last word on this, but it is an issue that we shall have to discuss both with the Council and Commission – I do not see excessive bureaucratic issues from this point of view. There are bureaucratic issues for many other measures but not on this one regarding the label, which I think can easily be followed in a secure timeframe and with clear results for all European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to join in congratulating Mrs Paliadeli on the excellent work that she has done.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that we can now say, once the report is adopted, that it is going to be the successful culmination of a new commitment to Europeanism, and I do not believe that it is trivial to make a commitment to Europeanism in the current times.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also believe that the decision of the Member States, the Commissioner and the Commission to place the European Heritage Label within the sphere of the European Union is going to help increase its visibility, prestige and credibility, but it is also going to strengthen the deep-rooted ideals of cohesion and solidarity between European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">The label is an important step towards European integration, because it is going to bring us and all citizens closer to our common history.</p>
      <p sl="es">When there are so many voices to be heard which so often are laying claim to individual history – frequently national history – I believe that an initiative such as the one that we are voting on today to lay claim to a common history and make it known has a really symbolic and extremely important value.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that what we are going to do with this European Heritage Label will also help the younger generations to understand the ideas that were behind the founding fathers of the European Union, so that they can see that this European Union, this European integration process that we are going through, is a process, and that like all processes, its conclusion depends on those that are working within it. I think that in this respect, the European Union is going to be what its citizens want it to be. I therefore urge everyone to work together. I obviously heard Mr Martin just now saying that we should avoid bureaucracy. Of course we should! However, above all, what we need to commit to is our common history, and making it known.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, a short while ago, when interpreting Mrs Badia i Cutchet’s speech, the interpreter used the term ‘Europeism’, presumably in error. No such word exists in the Polish language and, in fact, I have the feeling that the initiative we are currently discussing is constructing something that does not exist: ‘Europeism’, or some kind of artificial creation, which is a pawn in a political game.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that what we are doing is unnecessary. As a famous philosopher once said, ‘entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity’. It is my impression that the European Heritage Label represents an entity being multiplied beyond necessity. I will not mention the huge question mark hanging over the issue of how the label is to be granted and withdrawn. I will not mention the fact that the initiative will cost European taxpayers EUR 1 350 000. My question is of a fundamental nature, quite apart from these other serious matters, namely: why are we doing this? Do we really need to construct something which is not Europeanness, but merely the Europeism I mentioned earlier?</p>

    <intervention id="4-023" speaker_id="96706" name="João Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the current idea of culture is nothing new – we have heard it before during the discussion of other reports in Parliament and we have heard it again here today – it is on the verge of being considered instrumental in the European Union. This is expressed in various ways: whether in the context of so-called cultural diplomacy, in which culture is seen as a tool for foreign policy, or in the area currently under discussion of creating a European Union Heritage Label so as to, in the words of the rapporteur, ‘enhance the Europeans’ faith in the European Union and its leaders’ and ‘fill in the gap between the European Union and its citizens’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur judiciously realises that there are other more-effective means of achieving this, about which a great deal more could be said. I should like to point out that no label will be enough to erase the visible effects the policies that the EU has been implementing and its economic governance have had on the citizens and peoples of Europe: in short, the plans of true social terrorism it has been putting into action with the connivance of national governments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We should also consider the effects of policies such as the common agricultural policy or the common fisheries policy, amongst others, on the destruction of important cultural labels and the live elements of the cultural and historical heritage of the European peoples. Let us consider the future disintegration, over the course of just a single generation, of coastal or secular rural communities. This initiative, which has a predominantly symbolic significance, is based on developing the fallacy of a single European identity and a single European culture and, moreover, on values such as freedom, democracy, tolerance and solidarity, via the particularly sensitive area of cultural heritage and, in turn, that of history, which gives rise to the serious concern that this will encourage the alarming procedure of rewriting history that we have been witnessing recently.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Culture, like other historical phenomena, does not come from some kind of homogenous shared identity but rather, it is indicative of antagonisms, conflicts and cultural domination. Let us again ask ourselves about the meaning of the designation ‘European Union Heritage Label’, which is conferred on the basis simply of where the elements of heritage in question are located. Knowing, as we do, that European heritage is borrowed from many cultures and could also be claimed by the Islamic world, by the Mediterranean cultures or by the cultures of those people subjected to European colonialism, is it Heritage of the European Union or Heritage in the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to close by saying that, in general, with a few exceptions, the amendments tabled by the rapporteur have improved the Commission’s draft, but in this case, the report’s specific objectives are far less important than the misconceptions underlying it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, today, 16 December, we celebrate the 240th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven’s birth, the composer of the united Europe’s anthem.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given this excellent report from the Committee on Culture and Education, as a Romanian historian and writer, I would like to propose for a European Heritage Label an exceptional site which is unique in the world – St Andrew’s Cave, located close to the place where the Danube flows into the Black Sea. As is confirmed by Origen, one of the fathers of the Christian church, who learnt about it from his father, who, in turn, learnt about it from Andrew’s disciples, the first man to be called by Jesus Christ came here, to this small cave in the province of Scythia Minor, and spread the light of the Gospel. This is almost certainly the first Christian church in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">During the first few months of 2011, I am going to take the necessary steps to obtain community support for a grand project. I intend to erect an impressive statue of our Saviour Jesus Christ in the Romanian part of Transylvania, in the Braşov region to be exact. It will be 40 metres high, making it taller than similar statues in Brazil, Portugal and Poland. It will also have a church at its base where weddings, christenings and religious services to mark the great Christian feasts will be celebrated. In the dark days ahead, we will come through and emerge victorious only in the light of the Christian cross.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am very pleased that this initiative, which is already implemented in some Member States, has now come before the European Union as a whole. It was right and proper that a biennial cycle should have been chosen for awarding the label. I would also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur in this matter. However, I must admit that I have a slight reservation about the fact that we must manage to draw a precise distinction between UNESCO’s world cultural heritage programme and the European character of this label. Otherwise, it will be hard for our citizens to understand why this particular label has a special European dimension.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have taken a look to see what sites have been nominated by the Member States so far and have found, naturally enough, that they are primarily man-made structures. Our idea in the Committee on Culture and Education was not just to recognise buildings, although buildings are an important element, but, more importantly, objects of value and other sites, or even experiences, that are associated with European development.</p>
      <p sl="de">Which brings me to the last point in my comments. It will be particularly important to appoint appropriate experts to the juries who have assimilated these aims and who will help to implement and develop them. This being the case, there would be no need to fear the bureaucracy that could conceivably arise.</p>

    <intervention id="4-026" speaker_id="96917" name="Silvia Costa" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during a stage in its life in which Europe is undergoing a crisis of identity and prospects, I think that the establishment of a European Heritage Label that identifies those sites – both material and immaterial – of high symbolic and educational value for the history, culture and creation of the European Union, is particularly significant.</p>
      <p sl="it">My sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, who efficiently took on board the proposals and additions suggested by many of us in the Committee on Culture and Education, providing, in particular, for procedures that are more certain and more respectful of the Treaty of Lisbon with regard to the subdivision of tasks among Member States, the Commission, the Council and Parliament. As some of my fellow Members have picked up on, we also strove to make sure there was no overlap between the label and other initiatives of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) or the European Council’s historic and cultural itineraries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, on the basis of well-defined criteria, the Member States will present not more than two actively managed sites every two years. This is an important point: the Member States must show that they believe in the sites and therefore manage them in an educational way, involving the people. The Commission, meanwhile, will be responsible for pre-selection after hearing from a panel of experts, but it will also assume a monitoring role, will assess the effectiveness of the management of the sites every six years, and may also withdraw the label. Parliament comes out of this with a stronger role because not only does it appoint four of the 16 members of the European panel, but also because it has an active relationship with the list of pre-selected sites.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also support the solution provided to the complex problem of the marks already assigned on an intergovernmental basis to many Member States that, in any case, though not suitable for the new system and the new criteria, will retain their earlier mark and will not therefore be downgraded.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also appreciate the priority given to transnational sites, which will be a very interesting challenge for Europe, and the role assigned to the Committee of the Regions as part of an approach of subsidiarity, as well as the emphasis on the necessary involvement of Member States in the selection phase, including municipalities and regions, in order to avoid their being only partially involved. However, I think an extra effort by the Member States would also be useful. It would be very important for them to launch competitions aimed at young people in schools and universities to start a process to identify the sites, which would also become a way to reconstruct a common European history and destiny and mean that they, too, would contribute to the sense of belonging and European citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank you for the opportunity to speak for a moment on behalf of my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, about this important report on the European Heritage Label.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Listening to the debate today, sometimes my impressions recalled what a certain teacher once told me: anything that can be misunderstood will be misunderstood. By this I mean that some try to see this excellent project – whose purpose is to raise Europe’s profile and show that Europe’s strength lies in its diversity, in the fact that it is united in its diversity – as a threat to the notion of the nation state, or a threat to European identity, or to something else. It is not about that.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I believe that this is an excellent initiative, and I would say that we need to know more about Europe. We need to know about one another, because in that way we can build a better Europe in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Europe is a mosaic of nations where common ideas about democracy, human dignity and freedom of opinion have developed. They are core values that we want to take forward.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we talk about the European cultural heritage, it has to be said that we have a very rich one. I believe that this small investment that we are making, EUR 1.3 million for the entire programme, will benefit those sites that acquire the European Heritage Label many times over, and even financially. The financial benefit is not what is most important here either: above all, it is the psychological benefit derived from a strengthened European spirit and a better understanding of how this Europe of mosaics was born and what its basis and foundation are. When we know our background and history, then we will also be able to build a sustainable future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, again I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli, for her report. In my view, it is an excellent and necessary one. Furthermore, it is well worth moving ahead with the European Heritage Label project on the basis of the report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating a European identity and increasing citizens’ interest in the European Union and its origins are two challenges that the European institutions must face up to in order to achieve broad cohesion and solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, these challenges are at the heart of the goals of the Treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, Article 3 of the Treaty establishes the EU’s obligation to safeguard European cultural development. If the European dream is going through a difficult phase at the moment, this is not only down to the impasse regarding Europe as a political project, or the ongoing economic crisis, but is also due to the difficulties faced by a Union founded on an as yet unresolved identity.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this situation, it is more necessary than ever to reduce the gap between the European Union and its citizens, bringing the multinational yet shared cultural heritage of the European Union to its citizens and, above all, to future generations. This is the meaning and importance of a European Heritage Label: to bring Europe together in its diversity, promoting a shared culture and favouring integration between the places involved within its territory.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to realise this objective, the new label will focus on the symbolic educational value rather than on the aesthetic beauty of a site, favouring cooperation between sites and supporting joint projects amongst them. I should therefore like to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Mrs Paliadeli and the rest of the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular, with regard to the procedure for selecting the sites and strengthening the role of the European Parliament during the selection process.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am sure that the Member States’ decision to insert the label within the framework of the European Union will contribute to increasing its visibility and prestige, so as to realise the objectives of cohesion and solidarity among European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I, too, would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent report she managed to produce and for the negotiations she conducted with the Commission and Council. Even though she failed to have the European Union Cultural Heritage Label established, the European Heritage Label is still excellent, as is the project itself. I firmly believe that if it follows in the footsteps of the European Capital of Culture project, it will be hugely successful. It is an excellent initiative, especially as it gives rise to cross-border projects.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A number of states are collaborating in order to share the same values and traditions which they have enjoyed together for hundreds of years. I come from a city located at the European Union’s eastern border, perhaps the largest cultural city on the eastern border, just 10 km from the border. However, I have also been to Santiago de Compostela, which is virtually on the European Union’s western border – two cultural centres with very many things in common, but also with very many differences between them. One place is an Orthodox centre of pilgrimage, while the other is a Catholic centre of pilgrimage. We see the values we share most clearly when we go outside the European Union’s borders, when we travel on other continents. We then get a very clear picture of the values that we have been sharing for hundreds of years and of the fact that we have a common culture and certain features that differentiate us from other peoples. The European Union, or rather European Heritage Label, acquires its significance therefore when we go outside the European Union’s borders.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I congratulate you once again on this report and I firmly believe that it will be a successful project.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I welcome the fact that in the course of this session, this is the second proposal we are voting on that intends to bridge the gap between the European Union and its citizens. Converted from the intergovernmental programmes of several European countries into an official EU action, the introduction of the European Heritage Label will strengthen the sense of belonging to the EU, and will reinforce the recognition of differences and intercultural dialogue. It will make citizens, especially young people, aware of the importance of their role in European history and European symbolism. It can raise our awareness of our common cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The sites that are awarded the label will be more accessible, especially to young people, and the objects embodying our common history will be put to use more appropriately. What please me most, personally, are the organisational aspects of the action, namely, that the selection and supervision procedures will be conducted along common, unambiguous and transparent criteria, and professional exchange of experience will proliferate. As an elected Member representing a national minority, I note with satisfaction that in the case of Romania, for example, sites nominated by objective, international experts will also have the chance of being selected in addition to the four objects already holding the label. Such sites include the Teleki Library in Târgu-Mureş, which is known as one of the bastions of Hungarian culture, or the Black Church of Braşov, which is considered a quintessential example of Saxon Gothic architectural excellence.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the European Heritage Label is undoubtedly a good initiative, and a continuation of the intergovernmental project now operating since 2006. The aim of the initiative is to contribute towards the creation of a common European identity, increasing interest in the European Union and its values.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The concept of ‘cultural heritage’ is very broad, and that is a good thing. I am delighted that the proposal for amendment incorporating industrial heritage into this category was also adopted in the report. Industry is one of the important components of common European history – after all, Europe was the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, and the beginning of the EU is linked to the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community. It is also linked, however, with the common history of movements for civil and social rights.</p>
      <p sl="cs">One of the areas expected to benefit from the European Heritage Label is the area of tourism. I firmly believe that this is an opportunity to make use of the monuments of common European history to develop tourism in those regions which are not traditional tourist destinations too. This type of monument is, in my opinion, unjustly overlooked, and all that is required is to discover and make use of its potential. I therefore welcome and support the report very much, and in this context, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Paliadeli.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in the period before the Treaty of Lisbon was enacted, we were faced with a situation in which the citizens of the EU were becoming markedly less interested in its affairs and activities. Adopting the Treaty of Lisbon was intended not only to provide a solution to problems relating to the need for better functioning institutions, but also to involve Europe’s citizens more closely in the EU’s activities, for example, by means of the citizens’ initiative. The European Heritage Label is a further step towards building a European identity and strengthening the links between citizens and the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Over the past four years, the Member States have designated 64 sites with particular significance for Europe. By discovering our shared history and learning about the European Union’s role and its cultural diversity based on common democratic values and human rights, we can strengthen the sense of belonging to a large European family, within the framework of the EU, in the inhabitants of our Community.</p>

I have seen that in relation to the European City of Sport. Limerick, in my own constituency, got that award recently and it was much valued. The same is true of the European Cities of Culture and it will certainly apply to the European Heritage sites.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There are a few good things about this which should be commended. One is that you have to maintain the site, so that you will not get it forever without actually ensuring you deserve it.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, there are often discussions among citizens on the future of the European Union. The foundations of a strong Union and a successful future are built on trust and mutual accommodation, just like in a family. The European Heritage Label is a means for people to find out more about others, to find those things and recognise personalities and movements that symbolise the building of Europe. The identification of a shared cultural heritage is an opportunity to strengthen a single and united Europe. All nations and countries, we all have a different, varied historical experience, often painful, but it is these differences that go together to make up our family and form our European identity. In particular, I would like to emphasise the division of Europe that lasted for many years and the different or total lack of opportunities for the development of democracy. I am talking about Eastern Europe and occupation by the Soviet Union. However, there was always a struggle for the idea of a united Europe there too, and we must appreciate …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, nobody can accuse us of not being consistent. In the Treaty of Lisbon, we established citizenship of the EU for its inhabitants, and yesterday we had the opportunity to vote on the citizens’ initiative. Today, we are adopting a symbol, namely the European Heritage Label. This will unquestionably boost the EU’s identity and citizenship or, in other words, all the values that are of such importance to us. I believe that this label will act as an outstanding complement to both the UNESCO list and the European Cultural Routes, as well as the European Capitals of Culture. Anyone who travels knows the value and importance of such schemes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that promoting European culture to the very heart of Europe, to Europeans, is a fundamental aspect. A good deal of Europe is still undiscovered in this respect, but the promotion of European culture outside Europe also plays a key role. What is most important is that this label be promoted successfully by the Commissioner and the Member States.</p>

This project allows us to open a door as well to countries which enrich our continent’s culture without being part of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">One key aspect is the re-evaluation of sites which have already been designated under the intergovernmental agreement, as well as ensuring fairness with regard to states with a different number of initially registered sites. In addition, in the case where the sites cannot be re-evaluated directly, it is important for them to have the opportunity to reapply for the label in order to offer them more opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Awarding the European Heritage Label for an unlimited period, without a regular re-evaluation, would help make more efficient use of the reduced budget allocated to the project.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, creating a European identity and increasing the level of interest in the EU are major challenges. They are capable of generating cohesion and solidarity on a large scale. The European Heritage Label could meet its objectives in a more effective way if it was managed as an EU initiative. It must be based on the same criteria and have a very clearly defined monitoring system. One of the upshots of this will be to boost cultural tourism. Just as in the case of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the label will increase tourist numbers and provide a fresh boost to local economies.</p>

They stressed the importance of this initiative in promoting Europe, the common European history and heritage, the educational value of this initiative and its significance in creating and encouraging more cultural dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased and very grateful for this approval. I would like to make it clear that the experts who are going to be appointed for the decisions on this important initiative will certainly have the highest professional credentials to make sure that they choose not only the best and highest value sites, but also ideas. Let me remind you that this heritage is not only about sites, but also about intangible cultural heritage. For example, in Portugal, we have the decree which was the first decree in Europe abolishing the death sentence. That was included with the list of labels, so this heritage can be intangible as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to clarify that our purpose is indeed to have a simplified procedure – quality but simplification is important. That is why we have not accepted the Council’s proposal that after the experts’ group, the initiative would go to comitology, as that would create red tape and waste valuable time for the decision to be adopted.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to finish by saying that in these times of economic crisis which create divisions between the peoples of Europe politically, socially and economically, we need initiatives like this which will bring the people of Europe together.

Common but diverse cultural heritage is what will unite us.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to start by stating that I share the views expressed, both on the impact assessment of the European Heritage Label and its added cultural value. The label alone cannot bridge the gap between the public and the European Union. It can simply help, together with other initiatives, to address the problem. Of course, I cannot hide the fact that, in times of crisis, such as the recent crisis we have been experiencing, with the savage attack on the euro and the European Union, the public does not look solely to culture to resolve their basic day-to-day issues. However, a knowledge of history and respect for multiculturalism may act both as a cohesion instrument and as an incentive to growth for local communities, by calling on them to cooperate at local, regional, national and transnational level, as stated in the Commission proposal and as accepted by us. From this perspective, the idea of a cultural heritage label for the European Union – my thanks to Mr Ivan who remembered the initial proposal – which is designed to enhance the European public’s awareness of their common heritage and, at the same time, to support cultural tourism, is a positive step in this direction. Values such as democracy and freedom, which are rooted in Europe’s cultural past, are as important as transparency and solidarity nowadays, especially if we want to bridge the gap between the European institutions and the citizens of the Member States of the Union and the gap between the citizens of the Member States. Of course, we shall need to address bureaucracy issues, but I can assure you that the transparency and composition of the European team of experts will be subject to extremely clear conditions. There is no doubt that the institution will operate with absolute clarity.</p>

The European dimension and the significance of the sites put forward will help to foster European identity and a sense of European citizenship. Our continent’s history is an important element that could contribute to the integration of the peoples of Europe. Our younger generation must be properly aware of our common European heritage because it is very important for there to be no variations in the different versions or attempts at populist interpretation, as this is our common European history and it reflects our entire cultural and linguistic diversity. The selection procedure must make sure that only sites of suitable quality are chosen. I believe that Member States should submit their proposals in close collaboration with local and regional authorities. This will help popularise the sites at national level and bridge the gap between the European institutions and European citizens.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to lead this debate today because I remember that we both always cooperated with Switzerland in the European Council and are therefore both aware of how important it is for Switzerland to participate in these programmes. In 2006, before these programmes were renewed, we, the European Parliament, were naturally aware that we do not exist in isolation, but that we should try to bring everyone else onboard with us. Although Switzerland is not part of the European Economic Area, it was interested in participating in the field of training and education. Like everyone else, I was very pleased with this development. In 2004, I was part of a delegation that visited the Swiss Parliament’s Committee on Training. We discussed the relevant issues in detail, for example, mobility and cooperation between schools and universities. It was clear to me at the time that this motion would eventually be forthcoming and I welcome it now.</p>
      <p sl="de">In drawing up these programmes, we were not just thinking of our own interests, but also those of all neighbouring countries, such as the countries of the Western Balkans and Switzerland itself, situated in the middle. That is why we have made some good progress today. Concerning the previous debate, I can tell you now that Switzerland also intends to issue a request to join in the cultural programme. It is also interested in participating in the cultural heritage labelling scheme, something it can only do if it participates in this programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, what is it that we need to do today? We can either say ‘yes’ or ‘no’. None of us would dream of saying ‘no’ because we have always been in favour of Switzerland coming on board. I should add that by ‘coming on board’, I mean that it will also pay its share. According to Article 218, our only choice is to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and, of course, we are going to give a clear yes to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are the key points of this agreement with Switzerland? Naturally, the conditions, rules and procedures for projects and initiatives involving Swiss participants will be the same as for participants from the Member States and the projects they propose. Switzerland will have to set up a national agency, just as we all have done in our respective countries, that will coordinate the implementation of the programmes at national level and that will be required to make a financial contribution to each of the programmes each year. In 2011, this would amount to EUR 1.7 million for the ‘Youth in Action’ programme and EUR 14.2 million for the Lifelong Learning programme. With reference to the financial controls and audit provisions, Switzerland will be required to adhere to the provisions of the European Union, including those relating to the controls by the institutions of the EU and by the Swiss authorities. The agreement will remain in place until one of the parties pulls out. However, I do not believe that anyone would enter into a programme like this with the intention of ever withdrawing again. It is in the interests of the younger generation in Switzerland and, of course, of the young people from the countries surrounding Switzerland who would like to participate in school exchanges with Switzerland as part of the Comenius-Regio programme, or in individual school partnerships, as well as the Erasmus programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, representatives from the Swiss authorities will be able to attend our committee meetings on points which concern their country. Let me say one thing here: we are anxious that Switzerland should take the plunge with this step. It has expressed an interest in such an arrangement for a long time. It is our hope that European awareness in Switzerland will be strengthened when the younger generation has an opportunity to interact with other young Europeans. Perhaps this will mean that future referenda will have a different outcome from those in the past. We are placing our faith in the younger generation and in these two marvellous programmes. I am confident that the cultural programme will be added in three years’ time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, other than the Commission, I should also certainly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Mrs Pack, for the work and dedication that she has lavished on this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="it">What we are talking about today is important because it is an instrument like ‘Youth in Action’ that creates the spread of ideas, closeness and friendship amongst the countries of the European Union, but also, and above all, amongst those that are not part of it, such as Switzerland or other countries besides.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is the great richness of our multiannual programmes that, through actions such as ‘Youth in Action’, ‘Erasmus’, ‘Erasmus Mundus’, ‘Permanent Education’, ‘Media’, ‘Media Mundus’ and many others, they allow relationships to be built between the countries of the European Union and third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Through these programmes, you see, we have brought the European Union to life, allowing many citizens – primarily young people – to meet, swap experiences, come to know others and to become known themselves. We have given teachers and workers in general the chance to improve their professional skills and we have given directors, producers and associations of various countries the chance to do better work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Hence, these programmes are important and so we were a bit concerned when we did not see them on the Commission’s Work Programme for next year. Today, therefore, today we are approving an important step, which makes the EU grow, strengthens citizenship on our continent, and – given that we spoke about it a little while earlier regarding the European Heritage Label – it is a step that contributes to creating this European identity of ours.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I endorse the rapporteur’s draft report on agreeing to the participation of the Confederation of Switzerland in the ‘Youth in Action’ programme and in the action programme in the field of lifelong learning. The agreement has been appropriately negotiated and protects the EU’s interests, and the legal bases for European programmes in fields relating to education, training and youth provide for Switzerland’s participation. The principles governing this participation have been outlined in detail, which guarantees that the programmes will be implemented appropriately and fairly. Switzerland is keen to cooperate with the EU in the field of education, training and youth, and so our agreement should be self-evident.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are delighted that the EU’s education programmes are so attractive and effective that other countries are joining them. The latest European Commission research shows that the ‘Youth in Action’ programme increases young people’s linguistic abilities and their chances in the labour market. The opportunities for adult education are still not being fully exploited, however, even though there is enormous potential in this area.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, right from the outset, I wish to thank our committee’s excellent Chair, Doris Pack, who also drafted this report. I might say that when this proposal was in the hands of Doris Pack, it was in good hands. As our worthy Commissioner knows very well, Mrs Pack has much professional experience and expertise in these very areas of lifelong learning and youth programmes. When preparations were being made regarding this issue, it was a joy to observe how well this work progressed. It is excellent that young people in Switzerland are also to share in the success stories that we in the European Union have created.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is quite true that even those who take a critical view of the European Union, who are even opposed to it, nevertheless unanimously agree that the European Union does indeed have success stories, such as the programmes that relate to lifelong learning, youth and culture. This is one of the best aspects of the European Union, and one which we should do much to ensure remains visible.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is because of the European Union and these programmes that we have been able to encourage young Europeans to pursue a path of education and training and to increase their personal capital. It has also, however, increased the capital of nations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In this connection, it is very important that Switzerland is not in any way excluded from this system of cooperation, even though it is not a member of the EU or the EEA. Instead, young people in Switzerland should be given the opportunity to participate in the programmes and things should therefore be taken forward on a reciprocal basis. I believe that that will generate added value in all respects.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, finally, I wish to thank our rapporteur. I hope that this programme will be a success story for the Swiss too, as it has been for us, the citizens of the Member States of the European Union.</p>

It really is a good idea which should be entirely uncontroversial, since it exemplifies the values we are discussing. In fact, this may well be one of those reports to which the Chamber can lend its unanimous support, even if Switzerland’s situation is a unique one, as the Commissioner said. It is a very interesting country which is very special in political terms, and which engages in very interesting forms of cooperation with Europe while not being party to many European agreements, and for this very reason, it is worth building links with this country by means of uncontroversial and universally accepted programmes of this kind.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, even though Switzerland has not yet decided to become a Member State of the European Union, it has long shown a serious interest in broad cooperation with the EU in the area of education and professional training for young people. After the establishment of the Youth in Action and Lifelong Learning programmes in 2006, a legal foundation was put in place for cooperation between Switzerland and the EU in this area.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The European Commission, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Council following talks with Swiss counterparts, has drawn up an agreement making it possible for us to develop effective cooperation with our Swiss friends in the area of education and professional training of young people, as well as in the area of lifelong learning. The agreement is correct, balanced and expresses the interests of both signatories to expand mutual cooperation and support the exchange of knowledge and expertise in the interests of improving the quality of the education process.</p>

I would say that Switzerland is not just a beautiful and orderly country; it is of great interest to the European Union due to its direct democracy, the confederation of cantons. On the other hand, the European Union must also be of interest to Switzerland, because Switzerland is entirely surrounded by EU Member States. Finally, Switzerland is tuning its pulse of life to the European Union. I believe that once this programme has been adopted, it will be possible to do this even better. Switzerland will come even closer to the European Union, and the EU will understand Switzerland better; as our colleague Doris Pack mentioned, we will be able to anticipate better results in referenda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the moves for Switzerland to increase its cooperation with the EU in the fields of education, training and youth. The Youth in Action programme is a very important programme for young European citizens. It is a programme that needs to be highlighted more, and its aims and objectives need to be realised, in particular, with regard to the European Voluntary Service’s activities under the Youth in Action programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given that next year is the European Year of Volunteering, it is particularly significant that the European Voluntary Service – which supports young people’s participation in voluntary activity and aims to develop solidarity and promote active citizenship amongst young people – is strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ireland, volunteering in grassroots sports organisations offers sporting and leadership opportunities to thousands of young people. These organisations encourage active citizenship amongst young people, while promoting health, fitness and an active lifestyle. The programme and its voluntary measures should be enhanced and strong links should be forged with Switzerland in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many possibilities under the Youth in Action programme, and any measures to enhance its aims and to encourage and support young people in the EU should be sustained and strongly encouraged.</p>

Furthermore, the Swiss National Agency will cooperate on the implementation of the programmes at national level and will contribute financially to each programme on an annual basis. This bilateral agreement is very important both for Switzerland itself and the European Union, because the young people of Switzerland will be able to take advantage of various opportunities according to the ‘Youth in Action’ programme and vice versa. The European Union’s young citizens will be able to participate in all projects alongside Switzerland’s young people. I am therefore delighted that although it is not part of the European Economic Area and is not an EU Member State, Switzerland is nevertheless cooperating closely with the European Union in the fields of education, training and youth affairs.</p>

The benefits of being in the European Union without the obligations. Here today, I am a bit dubious as well. The Commissioner mentioned they will have to pay. Of course they will have to pay, but normally non-members pay more than members of clubs.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I will bow to the superior wisdom and experience of Doris Pack in saying that this may be the way forward. It may help create greater European awareness among the citizens in Switzerland and they may one day join the European Union.

In this season of goodwill, I am prepared to go along with the proposals.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, European youth is a generation that has been given the privilege to grow up on a peaceful continent almost free of boundaries, which is characterised by mobility and multilingualism, and which also offers a wide range of cultural and economic opportunities. In order to ensure that more and more young people engage in active citizenship, we need to establish stable aid schemes in the field of youth policy. It is true that Switzerland is not a member of the European Economic Area, but it closely cooperates with the European Union, and it does so not only in the fields of education, training and youth. Since 2008, Switzerland has participated in, and financed, several projects that aim to reduce economic and social differences within an extended Europe. Switzerland has expressed solidarity with, and commitment to, the enlargement of the European Union, and aims to establish firm economic and political relations with the new Member States.

      <p sl="it">As an Italian-Swiss citizen, I am happy that Switzerland is the first country from outside the European Union to participate in EU education programmes for young people, both in higher education and continuing skills training. Indeed, let us remember that even if Switzerland is not part of the European Union, it has made a major contribution to building the values and freedoms that are a shared heritage of the European continent.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a symptom of the success of programmes such as ‘Youth in Action’ that Switzerland requests that the mobility of our European programmes be extended to their young people and therefore, it is of significant importance that Switzerland is not only requesting a larger economic area but also a larger educational area. I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better, and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, understandably enough, Switzerland, which provides some of the financial backing for the ‘Youth in Action’ and Lifelong Learning programmes, now wishes to participate in these programmes. However, in the spirit of learning, it would also be good if the EU were to take a leaf out of Switzerland’s book when it comes to direct democracy. When the Swiss population decides against the erection of minarets, this decision is accepted. Likewise, the recent initiative on the deportation of foreign criminals. The Swiss authorities are aware that when the people say ‘no’, they mean ‘no’, so that they do not simply continue to hold ballots until they get the result they want, as has happened in the EU in the case of Ireland, for example.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact is that the original rejection of the constitutional treaty for Europe at that time may have made it easier for some Swiss to vote in favour of the Schengen and Dublin Agreements. They might find it easier to form an alliance with a loose federation of states than with a centralist European Union. This is something that cannot be concealed by the voices currently being heard in Switzerland calling for accession to the EU. Not everything in the European Union garden is rosy; centralising tendencies are on the rise and developments are moving inexorably in the direction of a transfer union.</p>

I think that Switzerland, an enclave surrounded on all sides by EU Member States, does, in fact, need to be open to the programmes. I think that young people are not always aware that, since they are not yet part of the European Union, they cannot benefit from this supranational European programme, which provides an excellent way to integrate young people and exchange best practices, and which really does ensure that cooperation and lifelong learning can be truly European.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also, and most importantly, like to offer thanks for the fact that today, we will be able to transfer a model of European programmes to a country which is not a European Union Member State. In the same spirit of acceptance and invitation, I would also like to encourage Mrs Pack and the Commissioner maybe to extend similar schemes to include other countries that are willing.

We should be encouraged by this small white spot in the middle of the map of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to our estimates, the ‘Youth in Action’ programme will reach about one million people. The important prevailing aim is that youth organisations should take part. This is a signal to the next generation that their active participation is very welcome. I would also like to express my appreciation to Mrs Pack for her efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to reach out from the Union to other countries, in this case Switzerland, as this is the only way that we can achieve success. Simply waiting for the Swiss to ask to join the European Union will probably not be enough in times like these.

This will open up horizons perhaps also for the Members themselves, but certainly for the younger generation in Switzerland. We are pleased with this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Mölzer is no longer here, but I note that he did not mention the fact that Switzerland did not hold a referendum on this cooperation. It is indeed remarkable that Switzerland decided against such a step in this area in particular. After all, it can be sure that the younger generation has been waiting a long time for the opportunity for such cooperation. Mr Mölzer obviously failed to notice that a referendum did not take place in this case. The people do not need to be consulted on every single issue. Good things, such as accession to the European Union, will be self-evident. I hope that the younger generation will benefit from the fruitful cooperation in these education and youth programmes and that they will become real Europeans who, at some stage, will say: ‘Now is the time for us also to join the European Union, sharing with the rest of Europe in all other policy areas. We are a single continent, and should also agree on these questions’.

This involvement in EU programmes is also important from the perspective that we have not had, until now, a direct cultural and education agreement. However, Switzerland’s participation in the Bologna Process and the creation of the European Higher Education Area guarantee that we can create together the conditions for achieving the 2020 strategy’s objectives, establishing in the process a strong link between Member States and third countries. Meetings between young people, exchanges of experience between teachers and researchers and increased opportunities for lifelong learning will help us create a common European identity. However, I want to stress that we also need to consider including the other countries bordering the EU in our programmes because education and culture should not stop at our borders.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Paolo De Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the welfare of laying hens (O-0178/2010 - B7-0657/2010).</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today represents an important opportunity to discuss the strategic issue of protecting animal welfare in agriculture. On 1 January 2012, the terms of Council Directive 1999/74/EC will enter into force, laying down minimum standards for the protection of hens, tantamount to the abolition of conventional battery cages as a system of rearing for the production of eggs. This method of animal housing will be banned in favour of systems of rearing that guarantee better animal welfare.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, the memory of the Council of the European Union on Agriculture, held on 19 July 1999, is fresh in my mind. It was an important day, on which, as the representative of my country (at the time I was the Italian Minister for Agriculture), I contributed to the approval of this important directive by voting for it.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now, one year after the irrevocable entry into force of the new legislation, data show that European producers are proceeding to adapt their production system, but not without running into difficulties. What we need is a concrete commitment from the Commission to safeguard animal welfare, to protect producers who have adapted their system of rearing to Council Directive 1999/74/EC, and, at the same time, to effectively guarantee the passage of the new legislation, avoiding distortions in terms of market competition.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why my fellow Members and I felt it appropriate to add this important topic to the agenda of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing. Hard work over recent months, involving all parliamentary groups, resulted in the oral question of 28 October 2010, which puts three important issues to the Commission:</p>
      <p sl="it">Firstly, to report on the implementation of the new legislation within the Member States;</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, the actions to be taken in the Member States to guarantee compliance with the terms of the directive, and compromising where necessary with those undertakings that show a genuine desire to adapt.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, measures and guarantees to be adopted to avoid crises in the egg market in the coming years and to prevent unfair competition from third countries that are not obliged to respect the European Union directive within the European internal market.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are the queries to which we are awaiting concrete and definitive responses from the Commission. Lastly, we ask the Commissioner to guarantee a more transparent market, along the lines of the concept of so-called reciprocity of rules, in order to facilitate the prospect of greater international convergence on the animal welfare standards applied by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Attending to this matter, which we have discussed a number of times in committee since the start of the legislature, is essential to prevent Europe’s efforts on animal welfare – our efforts, Commissioner – from being rendered useless by a market that is incapable of recognising the social values that are bound up in foodstuffs. We need to reduce the distorting effects of the possibility that producers outside the European rules system could translate the lesser restrictions they are subject to into greater competitive advantages.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, adopting the motion for a resolution on the welfare of laying hens, which we will vote on this morning, could represent a first and important step in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I was asked by Commissioner Dalli to pass on his apologies for not being able to be here in person, but I was pleased to take this question as former Commissioner in charge of animal welfare and health.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Commission, I would like to underline that the ban on conventional cages which was adopted in 1999 represents an important improvement for animal welfare in the European Union. Furthermore, it has stimulated intense debate worldwide. I also wish to highlight that Member States are primarily responsible for implementing EU legislation on the protection of laying hens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is making every effort to monitor enforcement in Member States, including through inspections carried out by the Commission’s experts, and through the data provided annually by the Member States on the basis of a specific Commission decision related to animal welfare inspections on farms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last month, in November 2010, official data for 2009 on production sites for laying hens were submitted to the Commission by 24 Member States. As of today, only 18 Member States have submitted complete data. This data shows that 66% of the production sites in those 18 Member States were keeping laying hens with free range systems, 29% with barn systems, 3.5% with conventional cage systems and 1% with enriched cages.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Commission is aware that important data gaps still exist and that three Member States did not reply at all while six Member States have only provided partial data. Therefore, the above picture is far from being complete. The Commission is continually asking Member States to complete the missing data on every possible occasion, including in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the meetings of the chief veterinary officers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, the Commission asked Member States by a formal letter to submit their national action plans to implement the ban in order to better analyse the situation across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this stage, the Commission is concentrating its efforts to ensure that Member States take the necessary measures to implement the ban on conventional cages by the legal deadline. Member States are responsible for ensuring that eggs not produced in compliance with the directive on the protection of laying hens are not legally marketable according to EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">A better picture of the situation will be available next year after the stakeholder meeting. The stakeholder meeting will take place in January 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, the import of shell eggs is very limited due to the short shelf life of the product as well as EU food safety requirements. According to EU legislation, packs containing eggs imported from third countries where there are not sufficient guarantees as to the equivalency of production standards are to bear the indication of farming method as non-EU standard. This label allows imported eggs not produced according to EU welfare requirements to be clearly distinguished.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will further examine the situation with all relevant stakeholders, as I said, in a meeting to be held on 19 January 2011 in Brussels, where options to ensure the smooth enforcement of the directive will be discussed.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are hurtling at breakneck speed towards a situation where millions of eggs will fail to comply with European rules. After all, as has been said earlier today, it is expected that 30% of all eggs produced in 2012 will breach the battery cage ban which we agreed in 1999.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, this is merely a matter of simple arithmetic. It costs the farmer 8 to 13% more to produce this kind of animal-friendly egg, from hens not confined in battery cages. On the other hand, whether we like it or not, the average consumer will still opt for cheap eggs and is prepared to pay only 3 to 4% more for this kind of animal-friendly egg. The competitive disadvantage that arises from this situation therefore appears to be very clear.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The key question is: what are you, the European Commission, going to do to ensure that farmers who are complying properly with the rules and who have invested in alternatives are not penalised in favour of their colleagues who are lagging behind. Commissioner, please do not just fob us off with the same old line that Member States are responsible for implementation and checks. You are the guardian of the treaties, which is why all our eyes are on you. I also find it very unfortunate that we are still discussing data and relying on getting a better picture next year, because it will be too late then!</p>
      <p sl="nl">What are we going to do? The pressure must be increased! In our resolution, we are, of course, demanding maintenance of the cage ban, more inspections, that national action plans should ultimately have to be drawn up and an export ban on any eggs which are not produced according to the rules, amongst other things.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commission, it is your move! If you do nothing, then not only will bona fide chicken farmers suffer, but so too, I fear, will your credibility and that of all European animal welfare regulations. Now, that is a situation that I believe we all want to avoid.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, like the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr De Castro, 12 years ago, I, too, had the opportunity, as Minister for Agriculture, to participate in the decision to adopt the legislation that we are discussing here today. It was a very long and difficult debate because we were confronted with two contradictory values: establishing conditions for animal welfare and ensuring the sector’s competitiveness. The solution reached was to favour animal welfare and allow a sufficiently long period for the sector to adapt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Although there is still one year until the new regulations come into force, the available data on farms that have not yet adapted are of concern to us, as the Commissioner indeed confirmed. We cannot allow companies that have invested and made a great effort to be in a position to comply with this legislation to be penalised or subject to unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am grateful to the Commissioner for the information that she has provided us with, but we would like to obtain more detailed information on what point each Member State has actually reached. We would also like to know what specific procedures the Commission is thinking of following to ensure that companies can, in general, comply with this legislation on 1 January 2012, other than those the Commissioner has mentioned, and if there is actually a framework of penalties with a modicum of uniformity between the various Member States. This is the intention of the resolution that we are discussing today, which will, I am sure, be widely supported in Parliament. However, my group will be voting against removing, in whole or in part, points F, 8, 9 and 14, which contain wordings and objectives that we doubt are compatible with EU law and that will reduce the resolution’s credibility if they remain.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information at the beginning of this debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regardless of whether you have the complete picture or not, the hard fact is that, as of 1 January next year, 80 million eggs in the European Union are likely to be produced under illegal cage systems. That is going to be a fact. We have a 12-month laying cycle. There is no way that figure is going to change dramatically by that time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to know what I am going to say to the likes of John Campbell of Glenrath Farms and all the producers in the United Kingdom who have spent, on average, GBP 2 million each to comply with the legislation and now incur an extra cost that is between 8 and 10% higher than under a conventional cage system. What do I tell our consumers back home, to whom we promised that, by 1 January 2012, there would be no more eggs on the market produced under the old conventional battery cage systems?</p>
      <p sl="de">I know what I want this Parliament and the Commission to say. I want to be able to go back and tell them that we are going to take tough action to make sure that the legislation is complied with. No derogations and no extensions. After all, producers have had ten years to comply. I want Member States who are compliant to be able to protect their consumers and their producers by being able to ban imports of illegally produced eggs from those producers and countries which are not compliant. I also believe that the Commission should draw up a list, once it has the information, and name and shame those who have failed to comply. It is no excuse to say that we were not aware it was coming. Ten years is a long time in any business cycle to be able to prepare and invest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, when you are winding up this debate, I hope you will give us a strong statement saying that you understand the concerns of producers and consumers and a promise of tough action that protects both of them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, your answers have failed to convince me. The details provided by the Commission in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development were also far from convincing. As Mr Lyon has already stated, this is a problem facing us down the line. From 2012 onwards, 30% of the eggs on the market will be illegal. However, we have no idea how to deal with them. Apparently, we are to trust states to meet their reporting obligations – permit me to ask why we do not initiate infringement proceedings or at least threaten such action, so as to make it quite clear that, at the end of the day, European law must apply in all Member States and to all farmers? We have built up a very high level of credibility in respect of animal welfare, and this is something we must also defend. Citizens rightly expect these standards to be applied. The public is very sensitive to animal welfare issues. After all, we do provide funding and public support to the farming community because we have more stringent regulations in relation to environmental protection and animal welfare. It is not unreasonable to expect something in return from all Member States. For this reason, I should like to ask: What is the Commission going to do now? We have already made a demand at committee level. We actually need to place a catalogue of measures on the table immediately. We cannot accept the possibility of further discussions aimed at extending deadlines. It cannot be that we now penalise those who have implemented policy by allowing others to work with transitional deadlines for even longer. This will cause farmers to lose faith in the institutions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">You raised a question in relation to labelling. What will happen with products that contain liquid egg instead of fresh eggs, for example? How can we label such products? This point must be regulated immediately at the very least.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has already been said several times that 10 years is a long time. Everyone in the European Union must have known that these deadlines would have to be observed. There can be no excuse for Member States, including new Member States, saying: ‘Sorry, but we ran out of time. Ten years really was not enough’.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is in pole position when it comes to animal welfare. We can use it to back up our arguments worldwide. We can use it in argumentation with consumers, which is why we must implement this consistently if Parliament and the Commission are not to lose credibility in relation to the implementation of European standards. For this reason, we are urgently calling on the Commission to take action, rather than wasting even more time risking a situation that will satisfy no one from 1 January 2012 onwards.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, can I also say I am not totally convinced by what the Commissioner told us today. There have been two occasions when officials from the Commission came to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and their performance and what they told us was not only unacceptable, it was abysmal and it was a disgrace.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I have listened to what the Commissioner said and I have listened with tremendous interest to some of the things she did say, but she has not given us anything other than the fact that they are going to meet the stakeholders in January.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what are you going to say to the stakeholders in January, Commissioner? What is going to be the outcome of that? We want to know, because you have got to realise that, today, the last hens are already in the conventional cages that have got to meet that deadline. They are already there. There is normally a 13 to 14-month laying cycle for hens that go into conventional cages.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, you made a comment during your remarks and maybe you will reply or enlarge on it: you said that eggs from outside the EU not meeting equivalent standards would have a different mark. What do you mean by that? Will you take on board the point that eggs within the EU produced unlawfully after 1 January 2012 will either have the same stamp, will not be allowed to be exported outside the country in which they are produced or will not be allowed to go onto the market?</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a terrible problem here because, as George Lyon said, there are 83 million eggs – we know that for a fact – which, on 1 January 2012 are going to be illegal. Now that is also a terrible plight for us in Europe, where people require eggs to eat. So what are we going to do here?</p>
      <p sl="en">I really think we need to know where we are going. Will you give us an assurance that you will come back to this House in March with a proper proposal as to what you intend to do – what measures you intend to bring in – to actually control this situation? As has been outlined by others, many producers have already spent millions of pounds in conforming to the standards. They cannot now be asked to take further pain by others who are not prepared to do the same.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission has created a huge crisis in the egg industry. Like it or not, 100 million birds will still be in cages on D-day – or should I say E-day? There is neither the cash nor the logistics to prevent this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Insisting on the ruthless enforcement of its rules in a year’s time from the comfort of an armchair may give the speaker a great feeling of satisfaction, but it could seriously jeopardise the long-term health of the British egg sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us look at the practical implications. How do you remove and dispose of 100 million hens in 24 hours? Or, how do you safely smash and dispose of 83 million eggs every day? On the assumption that you somehow succeed in either of these, where will consumers turn for their 83 million daily eggs? To Ukraine, to India, to Argentina, to Brazil, where all the eggs will have been laid in battery cages. Do any of these countries have a reputation for high welfare standards?</p>
      <p sl="en">Once this trade starts, it will expand very rapidly by virtue of its competitive advantage. It will be very difficult to stop. It will completely undermine the efforts of colony egg producers in the UK. In effect, we will export a large slice of our industry which has just made massive investments to stay compliant with EU rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that an intra-Community trading ban is a complete non-starter. Not only will it be impossible to police across open borders, but it could be challenged by the WTO. So the least bad solution – and I say ‘least bad’ – is to allow temporary derogations to non-compliant producers with conditions attached.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are some naked images I enjoy looking at, but I do not enjoy the visual image of lorry-loads of naked, unstamped eggs leaving foreign battery cage units en route to the UK in 2012. Unstamped eggs are a gift to a fraudulent trader. We have learnt this the hard way in the UK.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our UK solution is to mechanically stamp eggs with the code numbers that represent their method of production at the laying farm itself. This operation is proceeding on my own farm at this very moment, and the machinery is reliable. The Commission say it is far too difficult for them to organise the stamping of a special code on non-compliant eggs, despite its obvious necessity. Yes, this is, of course, the same Commission that is forcing UK sheep farmers to unnecessarily identify sheep individually with unreliable electronic equipment. What a glaring inconsistency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ‘least bad’ solution – and I use that expression again – is for the EU to insist that non-compliant Member States spend their regional funds on stamping machines and also to pay for an inspectorate whose staff are nationals of compliant Member States. This inspectorate will also visit packing stations and build up a database of the processors who use these battery cage eggs in their products.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most UK retailers are keen to avoid trading in battery caged eggs after the deadline, but they can only succeed in this if these eggs are properly identified.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is not just a matter about hens in unsuitable cages, but it is about the ability of the EU to oversee the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">States were given 10 years to comply by 1 January 2012 or the product would be illegal. The Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, British and others have complied, but certain large producers have simply refused. This involves massive capital costs and to comply means borrowing money. The regulation has put about 15 pence on a dozen eggs. Those bandits who do not comply might be given more time and would be clearly rewarded because they would have been given a price advantage.</p>
      <p sl="en">Eggs from illegal cages will undercut those who obeyed the EU. One producer borrowed GBP 10 million to comply with this directive. He did the right thing.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, in January 2012, 400 Spanish egg producers could disappear, which is around 30% of the total number in my country, with the loss of the production of 300 000 tonnes of eggs.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union could stop producing the 80 million eggs, which amount to 2 million tonnes, and if we do not act very intelligently, the only thing that we would achieve would be that they would be covered by imports from third countries, whose animal welfare standards are much lower than those in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This 1999 directive, which requires that the space in cages for laying hens be increased, demands that we act intelligently and positively, because otherwise, we will only weaken European production and give extra trade opportunities to third countries where the amount of space per bird is much smaller than what we currently have in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This directive requires a great deal of effort from European producers, as in Spain alone, it is understood that the cost is around EUR 600 million. It should also not be forgotten that it has an economic impact that extends to the egg products industry and the food industry in general.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore ask for your support for the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to paragraph 2, which asks for a solution to be found at least for responsible farms and responsible businesses that are in the process of transforming their farms and will have completed that transformation by January 2012. We need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process, thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the EU market, which will consequently increase prices for consumers.</p>

The time has not run out quite yet – there are still twelve months to go before the practice is to be completely banned.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012. It must be possible to threaten the Member States who have not succeeded in implementing the directive by then with legal action, such as financial penalties.</p>

How can it be that twelve years have not been enough for some Member States to implement this ban in good time and to prepare their poultry industry accordingly? This is just one of many examples of how poor implementation leads to frustration. Egg producers in Member States who have implemented the changes in good time are already experiencing competitive anomalies that run counter to the principles of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am calling on the Commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all Member States and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented. Eggs should no longer be produced in battery cages after January 2012 and the then illegal eggs should no longer be allowed to reach the shops, putting an end to their negative effect on competition. The farmers who have changed their practices to comply with EU requirements should not experience financial disadvantage while those who flout the changeover reap the economic benefits.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is impossible to explain to people in Europe why EU law does not apply equally in all Member States and why some Member States are always seen to be dragging their feet.

      <p sl="en">I would particularly question the figures, and perhaps you might clarify them? Did you say that 66% of production is now free-range? That is not the information I have. I dare say that the information you have is therefore selective, and you do need to have a very thorough stakeholders meeting because those are, let me say, very enriched figures. They do not at all give the true story of egg production in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say that if it was easy to comply with this legislation and if our consumers really – and I mean this – really, really wanted welfare-friendly framing systems, they would pay the price for them. They want them. They do not value them, and they do not want to pay the price for these. I have not received one query from a consumer in my time here in the European Parliament since 2004 begging me to have this legislation implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Remember that, folks. That is the fact of the situation. Having said that, it is important that this legislation passed by this House is fully implemented and that those who have invested huge amounts of money to be compliant are protected by the European Union. I think the Commission knows it will have a legal problem on its hands.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me address the market situation. There will be a very visible pile-up of eggs: 83 million of them on 1 January 2012 that are illegal! Morally and ethically, we cannot dump those eggs. It would be horrendous if we did, and also the market would suffer and prices to consumers would rise, and there would be protests and revolt.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission needs to tell us what is going to happen on that day, because it is inevitable these eggs will be on the market and there will be a black market in eggs of some description, so we do need clarity on this.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, as you will see, in this House we monitor compliance with legislation, including legislation that has not entered into force. If we extended that exercise to other sectors with deadlines still pending, we would have to have 15-day plenary sittings.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, we are discussing a sector that does not receive aid from the common agricultural policy and is suffering due to increased feed prices. It is not easy for the sector to cope with additional costs, but it must do so in order to comply with the high production standards that we set in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="es">Everything appears to point to the fact that by 1 January 2012, producers in many Member States will not have been able to comply 100% with the deadline set. It is calculated that there will be a shortfall of 30% of production in order to cover the needs of the EU market.</p>
      <p sl="es">The result is that fresh eggs will be produced here, and they will indeed be more expensive for consumers. We will buy eggs for processing elsewhere, and we will close the proportion of EU production that went to that market. By then, I hope that we will have had more success in requiring mutuality in our relationships with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will conclude: the legislation will be compulsory from 2012.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is quite clear what the resolution under debate is saying – there are to be no exceptions and no derogations. The European Commission is to prepare instruments for enforcement and for penalising production that is not adapted to the requirements. Unfortunately, nothing follows, either, from the statement in the preamble to the resolution that some producers will have had 12 years to adapt, while others will have had eight and yet others only five. I would add that the producers who have been given the shortest length of time to adapt supported the adaptation efforts of their counterparts in the old EU Member States by buying their non-adapted cages, unaware of the problems they were causing for themselves. Experts have found evidence to show that demand for table eggs in the European Union will exceed supply after the Laying Hens Directive has been implemented, which, in practice, will mean imports from third countries of eggs produced in cages which are certainly not adapted. I therefore call on the Commission to assess the feasibility of maintaining the ban on the use of conventional cages from 1 January 2012 while also finding solutions and clearly defined criteria for those producers who will not complete the modernisation process by 1 January 2012, as referred to in two amendments supported by my group.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to its authors, the key argument in favour of adopting this resolution, aside from animal welfare and competitiveness, is the fact that the transitional period for making adaptations was well-known and enshrined in the directive, and that this deadline cannot be changed. I hope that the Members who accept this line of reasoning and vote in favour of the resolution will all be just as determined and unanimous when it comes to voting in favour of there being no further transitional period after 2013 for the differentiation of direct payments in the European Union, since a deadline of 2013 was enshrined in the Treaty for this transitional period. It is enshrined as such, and I do not think we should change it.</p>

However, there is also a serious conflict between the old and the new Member States. I completely agree with Mr Kalinowski in that the old Member States had far more time for the transition, and in fact, they passed on their old, obsolete structures to the new Member States prior to the accession of the latter. Even so, it is evident that the rules must be followed, and it is also evident that once again, the European Union is putting its own producers at a competitive disadvantage by specifying stricter rules for them than those it applies to external suppliers for imports. Not only does it require these rules to be observed, but also quite often fails to control them effectively. Therefore, I believe that the European Commission is about to take another decision which will put EU producers at a disadvantage in relation to external markets.</p>

Provision has been made so that products not produced in accordance with the legislation cannot be legally marketed and traded within the Community from 1 January 2012.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, however, products produced to lower animal welfare standards will continue to be imported from third countries. In other words, when numerous farms in the Union are in danger of going out of business, due to enhanced animal welfare standards, products will be imported from third countries that do not even meet the specifications which apply in the Union today.

We believe that an integrated approach, which links the cost of the investment with the benefit to both the producer and the consumer from the use of enriched cages, would do more to convince producers to adopt the measure and, of course, such an approach would safeguard the distinct difference of European products, based on quality, safety and animal welfare standards, and protect them against unfair competition on unequal terms from third countries, which is exactly what we fear will happen.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of animal welfare is one that this House has tackled many times and I believe that Parliament, together with the Commission and the Council, has made a considered and balanced decision. I do not think we can backtrack on this.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore have the duty to look for the best ways to apply this measure and, in this case, we must structure it with a view to responsibility and enforce it in a responsible way with regard to all those operators who are adapting their production process. It is clear that we shall not be able to postpone this date and allow an additional period of time for the transition to a responsible system of animal welfare. It is incumbent upon us to think about all those people who have begun the transformation process and are carrying it out during a time of crisis and investment difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I should like to emphasise the issue of the transition phase to you, which takes into consideration all those farmers who have begun the adjustment process in order to take account of animal welfare, but who have not yet completed it. At such a difficult time of crisis therefore, I believe that particular attention should also be paid to these producers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I do not think either that it is fair for us to talk in general about a 10-year period which Member States would have had available. Romania and Bulgaria, for example, joined the European Union only three years ago, but rules are rules and they must be observed by everyone.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I want to urge fellow Members to vote for Amendment 2, tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). There is a large number of producers who have already started making investments to modernise their rearing systems or who are about to initiate such investments. However, these investments cannot be made overnight and it would be unfair for the producers in question to be penalised. I want to emphasise once again that it only concerns those producers who have started modifying their rearing systems, and the amendment refers to compliance with certain clearly defined conditions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, United Kingdom producers have been investing substantial sums of money – pushing up their production costs – in preparing for the implementation of this directive because they know that Britain will implement the law. Why should they have to face unfair competition from countries that fail to implement the law or possibly are granted exemption or delayed enforcement?</p>
      <p sl="en">The measure has been drafted with the barest minimum of enforcement, left to the precious care of greatly varying standards in 27 Member States. The language is hardly suggestive of uniformly severe enforcement. Words like ‘proportionate’ and ‘dissuasive’ have been used.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not in favour of the EU passing laws on behalf of Member States at all. However, if such laws are passed, it is not acceptable for some countries to be forced to comply and others granted effective exemption. Will the Commission ensure that countries that fail to comply will be prevented from exporting eggs to countries that do comply, or at least that eggs from non-complying units will not be exported? Our producers are demanding protection from unfair competition.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the subject being debated here today, allow me to start by reiterating that I believe, firstly, that directives should actually be complied with and that this is equally true for Directive 1999/74/EC, and, secondly, that concerns over animal welfare is a flagship issue that the European Union should uphold. That said, it is important to stress that adapting to the directive is quite burdensome for the sector’s companies: 30% per hen in Portugal. Moreover, there is no specific support from the Rural Development programme for this purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result of the lack of capital in this sector, limited bank credit and the crisis in general, it is imperative and urgent to acknowledge that the adaptation of many companies has been delayed. It is therefore important to allow extra time for those companies – and only those companies – that have already started to adapt as required.</p>

    <intervention id="4-095" speaker_id="96755" name="Sergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, none of us wishes to cast doubt on the need to implement a directive that dates back to 1999, as the credibility of this institution is at stake, and none of us wishes to cast doubt on the need to protect the wellbeing and health of animals.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, directives also need to be based on good sense, so today in this House, I should like to make a few good-sense observations. Firstly, between 1999 and today, there has been a deep economic crisis that has hobbled businesses, industry and consumption, so many businesses have not been able to make the adjustments. Should we not take that into account?</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, rigorous application of the directive from 1 January 2012 would remove many businesses from the market, paving the way for the import of eggs produced using methods that are much less protective of the animals than those required and practised in the European Union, or to the relocation of European production facilities to outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">If this is what we want at a time of crisis – to favour a drop in employment and an increase in imports of eggs produced outside Europe, under different criteria than those imposed on our producers – then I think that we shall commit an injustice.</p>
      <p sl="it">We worked a great deal on the idea of a substantial transition phase and I feel that I support it. Commissioner, I am asking you to guarantee it as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as many colleagues across this Chamber have said, protecting producers who have complied with this legislation and spent vast amounts of money is absolutely right and is the duty of the Commission at this stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I do feel that there is something the Commission needs to realise. I have spoken to many of my own farmers who find it difficult to find the money to invest in difficult financial and economic circumstances. I am interested in the reference to the marking or stamping of eggs. I have a recent letter from the Commission which actually indicates that an additional mark would have little or no benefit because the Commission did not believe that consumers would actually differentiate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I would ask the Commission to indicate to us whether it has changed its mind on this issue or whether it simply does not know? Again, I would ask the Commission to indicate if it intends to go down the route of an intra-EU trade ban. I have companies in my constituency which rely on the import of eggs from other European countries. Are they simply going to force these companies to rely on third-country imports? Most certainly, the eggs there will have been produced under much less stringent welfare systems.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there can be no debate about the fact that farmers must adapt to the 1999 directive. We understand those farmers who have already invested money in modernising cages. We are not talking about giving more time to some farmers than others, as one of the previous speakers said, but about giving the same amount of time to everyone to meet the requirements made of them and to ensure that the standards are met.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The terms ‘illegal production’ and ‘consumer care’ have a very nice ring to them, but I would like to know why we do not show the same determination in protecting consumers against the consumption of imported eggs produced in conditions which do not meet the requirements introduced in the EU. I always try to understand the situation of different groups of farmers in the individual countries, and I am in favour of solutions that help them, since I know that as a group, they are in an exceptionally difficult situation in terms of revenue. It is a shame that others in this House do not share the same view.</p>

In the Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA) scientific committee, where we carry out technology options assessments, we also have the ‘Better Life’ project, which looks at ways of improving future conditions in the area of nutrition and feedstuffs. For this reason, particularly in the context of the Eighth Framework Research Programme, I would ask the Commissioner to work to ensure that the research programmes in the areas of foodstuffs/feedstuffs are strengthened, so that there is an improvement in research into the safety of foodstuffs and the health of animals and humans in this area and so that we can prepare the appropriate documents here for the citizens of Europe in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for your indulgence. I wanted to mention two other points in my contribution. The issue of eggs in shell is quite visible and clear. There is, however, a massive market for processed eggs for the confectionery sector and we need to know what sort of labelling requirements there will be for that product.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this is where we have the greatest concerns because more and more eggs are going into the processing sector, and my fear is that we will export our cages from the European Union and then import liquid-egg and dried-egg products from those very systems in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see you nodding in agreement. This is a very real problem for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">My other concern relates to parallel production systems and a huge problem in the marketplace if we have enriched cages coming into production while the current systems remain in production. That could cause major problems for producers and, ultimately, for consumers. So the Commission has a huge balancing act to get this right.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is obvious that there is no consensus on this issue. I have heard Members here pleading for no exemptions and no derogations and, on the other hand, I have heard Members pleading for an extension. It depends on which country they come from and on the stage of development in each particular Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me underline the Commission position. I want to repeat that, as of January 2012, conventional cages must be replaced by enriched cages or alternative systems. Therefore, eggs from conventional cages will not be legally marketable after January 2012. This is our position.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is making every effort, and we are concentrating on our efforts, to support Member States in complying with this directive. What are we doing? First of all, we are encouraging Member States to develop and complete national plans, in collaboration with the industry and major stakeholders, and we are receiving national plans which also incorporate sanctions for those industries, or those farmers, who are not in compliance with the directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we are exchanging information with Member States on good monitoring practices for reporting on progress with enforcement. We are organising visits by Commission experts to see that the directive is being implemented, and we are organising appropriate meetings with stakeholders. As I said, on 19 January 2011, we have a big stakeholders’ meeting at which representatives of the Member States will discuss the current state of play, and we will see how best we can support Member States who are not in compliance, so that they can complete their compliance by the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is our position. After January 2012, if there are still eggs which are not legally produced, those eggs cannot be marketed, and if non-compliance is demonstrated, the Commission could, of course, undertake all the measures available under the current legal framework – initiating infringement procedures in order to ensure proper enforcement of EU legislation. Alternatives to infringement procedures are also being studied, with a view to preventing the possible illegal circulation of eggs produced in conventional cages after January 2012.</p>

      <p sl="it">Council Directive 1999/74/EC lays down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens under various systems of rearing with the added objective of protecting against unfair competition among producers in the different Member States. Although I support the principles of this directive, it must not be taken lightly that, as things stand, a great many European producers – having begun the process of converting their facilities – have run into real problems in completing the transformation and risk not being ready before 1 January 2012, the final deadline for complying with the directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we also bear in mind the real difficulties faced by many producers in obtaining financing to support conversion processes and the serious economic difficulties that they are still having to deal with today – with serious repercussions on the stability of their businesses and employment levels – I am convinced that something has to be done. Member States should intervene to promote measures that can help European producers in the poultry farming sector who, aiming to adapt to the new European legislation, have embarked on the process of converting their facilities but are very unlikely to complete it before the start of 2012.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is very important that this programme can be extended outwards, and now Switzerland is to participate. Moreover, this will not cost us taxpayers in the European Union anything, as Switzerland is itself paying for its involvement. It is important that these best practices and best programmes that exist in the European Union are extended in this way. The Lifelong Learning programme and the Youth in Action programme are good examples. In this connection, I also want to welcome Switzerland to the European youth and culture programmes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to put one question to the House. Why is Switzerland doing so well? You would have thought that a country particularly exposed to the financial sector would have suffered unusually during the recent banking crisis, but the Helvetic Confederation in 2009 had a GDP per head 214% of that of the EU. Its people are twice as rich as the citizens of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In part, of course, that reflects the deal that the Swiss have struck with Brussels. They are in the free market, they are covered by the free movement of goods and services and so on, but they are outside the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy, they control their own borders, they settle all their own human rights issues, they pay only a token contribution to the budget and they are free to sign accords with third countries in commercial areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">What a great model for Britain! If seven million Swiss relying on bilateral free-trade agreements can give their people the highest standard of living on the continent, how much more so could we, a nation of 60 million, a trading maritime nation whose colonising and enterprising energies have touched every continent?</p>
      <p sl="en">And we should not leave it at our relations with Brussels! Having got the power back, we should copy the Swiss in their system of localism and direct democracy and push powers down to the lowest practicable level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am going to put this as simply as I can. Irish taxpayers and EU taxpayers are being gouged in order to prop up the European banking system and the single currency. Yesterday, the House of Commons in my country voted through a bilateral loans package to Ireland which was supported, I think, by sincere and generous MPs thinking that they were helping a friendly country.</p>
      <p sl="en">But you do not help an indebted friend by pressing more loans on him at a ruinous rate of interest. Ireland has been ruined by the single currency. Between 1998 and 2007, it had real interest rates of -1%. Every Irish economist could see the crash coming but there was nothing they could do about it because there were no longer any Irish interest rates. There were no rates to be raised. Now, when the crash comes, it is worsened by the inability to devalue. A nation is being condemned possibly to a generation of deflation, debt and emigration so that we can keep this project of ours alive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of helping to bail out the euro in Ireland, we should be helping Ireland to bail out of the euro and to re-establish its own currency, possibly with a temporary link to sterling, allowing it to pay off its loans and to re-establish itself as an independent and prosperous state.</p>

I would like to draw your attention to the continuing problem of discrimination against minorities, including the Polish minority in Lithuania, an EU Member State which is a signatory to international agreements and treaties on the protection of human rights and minorities. The Lithuanian Parliament was to take a decision today on whether to limit opportunities to receive education in a minority language. It has postponed the decision to the near future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In general, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur have improved the Commission’s initial draft. However, there are also some negative aspects. Regarding the promotion of multilingualism, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur do not touch on the central issue and therefore fail to correct the serious flaw in the original proposal. Indeed, real and effective promotion of multilingualism is achieved, not ‘by using several languages of the Union’, but rather by using the various languages of the Union. However, what is more important than the report’s specific objectives are the misconceptions underlying this concept. The European Heritage Label (or European Union Heritage Label) is based on developing the fallacy of a single European identity and a single European culture based on values such as freedom, democracy, etc.</p>

In this case, however, we must preserve the tradition of giving this award to values actually located within the EU.

The European Union can be proud of its well-developed student exchange system and of its open labour markets, which mean that every young European has a great many opportunities for intellectual and professional development.

Let us hope that cooperation with the EU will mean that young Swiss people, particularly those from the immigrant population, will have a better chance of accessing education. Member States’ experiences of programmes facilitating educational exchanges for young people show clearly that they not only promote a good education, but also play a positive role in terms of European integration thanks to acquisition of the languages, cultures and traditions of individual countries. At the same time, the Lifelong Learning programme represents an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the role of women in Switzerland. The country was the last in Europe to grant women the right to vote in federal elections, in the 1970s, and for a long time, women have constituted a social group which finds it difficult not only to participate fully in civil society, but also to access education and professional self-fulfilment.</p>

As far as violence against women is concerned, the European Parliament expresses its deep concern about the entrenched gender-based discrimination and domestic violence in several countries, and points out that women living in rural areas are a particularly vulnerable group. I therefore approve of Parliament’s requirement that women’s rights be explicitly addressed in all human rights dialogues and, in particular, the combating and elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, all forms of harmful traditional or customary practices, for example, female genital mutilation and early or forced marriage, all forms of trafficking in human beings, domestic violence and femicide, exploitation at work and economic exploitation.

      <p sl="lt">I urge the North Korean authorities to make concrete and tangible steps towards improving human rights conditions. I urge Pyongyang to allow inspection of all types of detention facilities by independent international experts, and to allow UN Special Reporters to visit the country. I also call on the North Korean authorities to lift restrictions on the ability of international staff to monitor the distribution of aid, and to ensure that international aid reaches the needy.</p>

His chair was empty, because the Cuban Government would not have allowed him to return home. This is a shocking and symbolic example, serving as a brutal reminder that the human rights situation in the world is not improving. The practice of the death penalty close to home in Belarus, hangings and stonings in Iran, female genital mutilation in Somalia, mass rapes in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the murdering of journalists in Russia, 215 million children working, arbitrary detentions, unfair trials, censorship, and so many other barbarities that require the European Union to be steadfast and uncompromising.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report adopted today requires us to put human rights at the heart of the European Union’s external action, in its development, defence, trade, fishing, immigration and justice policies. The universality of these values must take precedence over geopolitics, once again cynically revealed on 10 December 2010 when 15 countries made a cowardly response to China’s express request that they boycott the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese citizen, Lu Xiaobo.</p>

      <p sl="it">I should like to congratulate Mrs Andrikienė on her excellent work. Parliament’s annual report on human rights – this year in relation to 2009 – is a point of reference for all those interested in the issue. This edition is even more important, because it is the first since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which grants the European Union greater powers in foreign policy. In fact, the greatest hope for human rights is the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon in terms of foreign policy: The European External Action Service must reflect the priorities and the spirit of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the priorities of a coherent foreign policy should be the promotion of democracy and human rights. Lastly, I note that Parliament’s annual report on human rights not only provides a long list of problems; it also suggests solutions. The report notes the abolition of the death penalty in several countries, the progress made on violence against women, the protection of children, the fight against torture, protection for human rights activists, the promotion of democracy and religious freedom, and so on.</p>

All human beings are born free and equal, and it is clearly our duty to do everything possible to ensure that this is the case across the world. Notwithstanding the fact that the European Union’s external policy has made some important strides in recent years, the road to adopting a shared and coherent policy for the promotion of human rights is still a long one.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, the Council and the Commission need to improve the European Union’s capacity for rapid response to violations in third countries. Beginning with the firm condemnation of the death penalty across the European Union, we need to strive to achieve and reaffirm human rights on a daily basis.

      <p sl="nl">The report on the annual report on human rights in the world in 2009 and EU policy on the matter provides a near total overview of human rights problems across the world. The report also takes up new types of human rights issues, such as human rights protection and the fight against terrorism. Thanks to the amendments of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, a chapter has been included on the role of human rights in the newly-established European External Action Service (EEAS). This is very important given the fact that, as a new instrument, the EEAS is able to provide us with an opportunity to review the EU’s human rights policy and to defend human rights worldwide in a more coherent and decisive way. I therefore support 100% the proposal to appoint a high representative, who, together with his/her service, will coordinate the Union’s human rights policy on a permanent basis. The core message is clear: human rights should occupy a central place in the foreign policy of the European Union. There is still a long way to go, but Parliament will keep its finger on the pulse.

I am convinced that any long-term solution must include concrete measures for the eradication of poverty, under-development and discrimination against women, enhancing respect for human rights and the rule of law, strengthening reconciliation mechanisms, ensuring an end to opium production, engaging in a robust state-building exercise, and fully integrating Afghanistan into the international community, as well as banishing al-Qaeda from the country.

Almost 10 years after the Western coalition drove the Taliban from power, peace and prosperity are still far from being a daily reality for Afghans. The strategy used for years in the country is flawed and must be changed. The Union must assert its views on the subject and take note of the failure of the United States’ military policy in the region. Our troops are bogged down, and no hope of exit seems possible under such conditions. For these reasons, I supported Parliament’s resolution calling for a new strategy for Afghanistan. The system that has been in place until now must be changed. We have to tackle corruption and waste so that international aid can at last fulfil its role. Peace will return through civil action. The coalition needs to be stricter when controlling these funds. On the other hand, we must stop interfering in Afghan affairs. The Afghan Government must be free to find its modus vivendi with all the groups that make up Afghan society.

The report does indeed contain several positive points and it acknowledges the highly unfortunate aspects of the current situation and the responsibility of the international community, especially NATO, the EU and the Member States, which are involved in various ways in the war in Afghanistan and the ‘management’ of its ‘reconstruction’. The report also highlights the fact that the distribution of money and international aid does not reach the Afghan people. It also illustrates how negative and absurd it is for foreign troops to remain in Afghanistan, given that, apart from the human victim aspect, it proves that the situation has worsened in terms of the poverty of the Afghan people, the level of respect for women’s rights, the spiralling rise in opium crops and even the emergence of mafia organisations and corruption through the privatised security system applied by the USA. Unfortunately, however, amendments by the conservative forces which contradict the original text have altered it. It welcomes ‘new counter-insurgency policy’, adopts President Obama’s timetable, calls for closer identification by the EU with NATO and the USA and recognises the efficacy of and need for troops to remain and secure the area.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Nine years after the start of the military intervention in Afghanistan, it is possibly the greatest challenge faced by Europe and its allies in terms of foreign intervention and global security. The truth is that in the last decade, despite the strong – and uninterrupted – international presence in Afghanistan, security in the country has deteriorated. Terrorists continue to be supported and trained and, on top of this, the main socio-economic indicators are unsatisfactory. At present, therefore, the main objective of the international community and of Europe should be to encourage the creation of a strong and stable government, so the peace process continues to be supported, insofar as it respects the three basic commitments listed in the report: (i) Afghanistan’s commitment to banishing al-Qaeda from the country; (ii) eradicating poppy cultivation and combating drug trafficking; and (iii) a willingness to establish a basic respect for fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Within this framework, and in accordance with the international commitments that have been made in the context of NATO, the military presence in Afghanistan should be progressively reduced, while maintaining international support for peacekeeping and security with a view to post-intervention stability.</p>

      <p sl="it">This report is perhaps the best compromise that can be reached today on the new European strategy in Afghanistan. This is partly thanks to the numerous and crucial amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which made it less ideological and more pragmatic, and capable of recognising the criticalities discovered over nine years of operations on Afghan territory, as well as identifying the positives and lines of development to make the international community’s presence more effective and favour the transition towards a complete hand-back of sovereignty to the Afghan authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">A solely military response cannot be enough, it is true. It is, however, an essential precursor, in order to weaken the Taliban groups and drive them to cut all links with al-Qaeda and therefore to sit down at the negotiating table. Preventing civilian massacres remains a priority, of course, but we must not deny ourselves the use of drones, which are performing well in the areas around the border with Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="it">The commitment to the European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan (EUPOL) needs to be reinforced in order to continue to train a police force that is capable of maintaining public order.

The anti-war movement has warned of these problems since the start of the war. However, I abstained as I could not support the report’s support for the occupation and the ‘surge’ that has been carried out by the Obama administration. I abstained on amendments calling for more support to the Afghan State. I support respecting the sovereignty of the Afghan people, but the Karzai regime is corrupt and does not reflect the interests of the majority of the Afghan people. I call for all aid to be democratically controlled by the small farmers, workers and poor of Afghanistan. I note the tribute in this report to ordinary soldiers who have been killed and to the Afghan people who are victims of this war.

      <p sl="fi">There is no military solution for Afghanistan, something the report also states. If the troops have not been able to bring peace to Afghanistan, neither has the money that we have poured in. The report even says that between 2002 and 2009, more than USD 40 billion in international aid was channelled into the country. Of this 40 billion, just six billion went to the Afghan Government, the remaining 34 billion being channelled into the country from elsewhere. As much as 70 to 80% of this aid never got to its intended recipients, the Afghan people.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Furthermore, the costs of the war in Afghanistan over the period 2001-2009 amounted to more than USD 300 billion. However, these enormous sums of money are not doing the Afghan people any good.

      <p sl="lv">I fully support the report where it calls for efforts to reconstruct Afghanistan and an improvement in the human rights situation. It cannot be denied that the security situation in Afghanistan today is much better than it was nine years ago. People live in a freer society, girls can get education, and medical services are more accessible than under the Taliban regime. However, serious problems, in the resolution of which there has been no progress, still remain. This can especially be said about the war against drugs, as is rightly emphasised in the report. According to expert opinion, 92% of the world’s opium is sourced in Afghanistan and is then distributed throughout the world, including the European Union. We must take into account the fact that the cultivation of opium poppies represents a significant source of income in rural areas, where other forms of earning a living are difficult to find. That is why the destruction of opium poppy plantations without offering alternative means of earning a living is not an effective solution.</p>
      <p sl="lv">The government of Afghanistan must make more purposeful use of international aid to develop small enterprises and agriculture in regions where opium is currently grown. The European Union’s investment in rebuilding Afghanistan is significant, but there is still much more to do. The most important thing is to guarantee security. I should like to stress that a premature withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan would not only be dangerous for the local population and a threat to the democratic world, but it would also thereby destroy all the good that has been achieved in Afghanistan. People have paid a high price for peace in Afghanistan, and we must not let them down.</p>

I also think that it is positive that the report calls for police training to cease being in the hands of private contractors as soon as possible, along with the recital stating that there is no obvious end in sight for the war in Afghanistan due to the militarism and warmongering that has taken place so far.

He is aware that resources and troops are being deployed completely incorrectly in Afghanistan and that additional resources and troops will do nothing to change this. He has correctly recognised that the presence and disdainful demeanour of the Coalition is the primary reason for its absolute rejection by the local population. He is also aware that it is not possible to foist democracy and Western values on the people of Afghanistan.

Europe is wasting its resources instead of deploying them where they are urgently needed, for example, on the EU’s Balkan borders. It is hard to see what European interests are actually to be defended in the Hindu Kush. It would seem that the primary concern is not to establish democracy in Afghanistan according to the Western model, as the Americans claim. Instead, economic interests play a central role, particularly because, according to the New York Times, it is estimated that around USD 1 billion worth of natural resources lie buried in Afghanistan.

I believe that it is also important that the financing of the permanent crisis mechanism must be based upon the ‘polluter pays principle’, meaning that Member States creating bigger risks by their deficits and debt burdens should finance a larger proportion of the total assets.

The debt and deficit are simply a pretext. All the national governments in the Member States of the euro area and the EU are being called upon to step up the adoption and application of even more savage, barbaric and anti-labour and anti-grassroots measures coordinated by the EU, the ECB and the IMF. The summit will create the ‘support mechanism’, which is basically a bankruptcy mechanism. The debate on resources and the participation of private capital is wool over the workers’ eyes. The aim is to ensure that the plutocracy does not go bust. Capital makes the markets more visible to the absolute regulator of Community mechanisms and amends the Treaty of Lisbon in that direction, so as to safeguard its profits by over-exploiting the workers and by plundering the wealth that they produce. Enhanced economic governance is being imposed in order to control capitalist restructurings and step up the attack on the life and rights of workers. In light of this all-out attack by capital and the plutocracy, there is an urgent need for a broader grassroots rally to radically reverse the power correlations for the benefit of the grassroots alliance and to achieve an exit from the EU, grassroots power and a grassroots economy.</p>

We need to find new and innovative instruments to finance the crisis mechanism. Through the issue of Eurobonds, the crisis mechanism would be financed on the markets, drawing on foreign capital and people looking to invest, without any negative effect on national budgets. A mechanism based solely on pro-rata contributions, under the form of mere provisions of reserves, would imply a major burden on Member States, which would have to find the cash or capital to deposit without this bringing any yield or return. In a situation like the one at present, where Member States are asked, on the one hand, to implement severe budget policies to reduce deficits and debts and, on the other, to pay contributions to participate in the stabilisation fund, there is a real risk of collapse.</p>

I voted for the resolution because a delay would be unthinkable, but we have supported countries such as Spain and Portugal in bringing in an instrument that guarantees a ‘soft’ transition for businesses which have begun to change their rearing systems but which will not have completed the process before the deadline. It is not my desire to harm animal welfare and ask for a delay, but to underline a few essential points that need to be reiterated with force. Firstly, for the principle of reciprocity, the European Commission is asked to implement a monitoring system to supervise the quality of eggs imported into the European Union and guarantee total respect of European standards and rules. Subsequently, the Member States are asked to include measures in their regional development plans to support the laying-hen sector in this difficult time.</p>

      <p sl="en">I strongly support this resolution which demands that all the provisions of Directive 1999/74/EC on the welfare of laying hens be fully implemented by all Member States by the deadline of 1 January 2012. It declares that any extension of the deadline, or ‘phase-in period’, for any Member State is unacceptable – considering that producers have already had 10 years in which to comply – and would have grave ramifications for the successful and timely implementation of any future animal welfare rules. It also requests that the Commission launch swift and effective infringement proceedings, with heavy and dissuasive fines, for lack of compliance with all elements of the directive.</p>

      <p sl="de">Eleven years on from a provision having been passed, it is hard to understand how it can be that so few steps have been taken for its implementation. This can mainly be laid at the door of the Commission, which, in the past, has often watered down its former provisions, so that they were no longer taken seriously. If it indeed proves to be the case that here, too, a lazy compromise will be reached, this will once again undermine the credibility of the EU. It is my fervent hope that by 1 January 2012, there will no longer be any illegal battery farms in the market or, at the very least, that these will be hit with such punitive taxes that they will no longer enjoy any competitive advantage. For this reason, I voted in favour of the report.</p>

These investments cannot be implemented overnight and it would be unfair for the producers in question to be penalised. This amendment will allow an important number of Romanian – and not only Romanian – producers to start modernising works in the coming period so that they will not have to cease their activities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Council Directive 1999/74/EC stipulates that from 1 January 2012, unenriched cages can no longer be used. European farmers will have to choose whether to convert their systems to use enriched cages – which are more spacious, to improve the animal’s wellbeing – or to rear laying hens on the ground, outside, or in organic systems. According to recent surveys, it is thought that 30% of European farms still use unenriched cages. Real difficulties in adapting to the new system before the deadlines set by the directive have been observed. This is the case in Italy, for example. Through the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting of 22 February 2010, the European Commission has stated that no exceptions are provided for in the application of the ban. An amendment to the resolution, however, meant that a possible alternative solution was reached for those producers who have started to replace their systems of rearing in favour of the new cages. I therefore voted for it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The welfare of animals in general and of laying hens in particular is a serious business. To prove it, not only did the European Union legislate on the subject by means of a 1999 directive prohibiting battery cages for laying hens from 1 January 2012, but the transposition of that text also caused a disagreement between the Walloons and the Flemish in 2004. In this debate, it is essential to be sensible and to find a solution which takes into account both animal welfare and the economic interests at stake. Those who say that Community rules should be complied with, that unfair competition between breeders should be prevented, and that a 12-year transitional period is ample time to write off the investments are right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the opponents, who are demanding a little flexibility in the rules, especially at this time of austerity, and saying that the switch to enriched cages or non-cage systems will cost the poultry sector, a non-beneficiary of direct aid from the common agricultural policy, a huge amount of money, are also right. That is why I supported the three amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which reflect the everyday reality for all European breeders.</p>

There can be no disputing the need for adaptation to comply with the requirements of the directive, which introduces a ban on conventional cages, but we should give all Member States the same amount of time to implement it. The difficulties faced by many European producers in adapting to the regulations that are to enter into force as of 1 January 2012 will bring about a shortage of table eggs on the market and a significant rise in the price of such eggs, a fall in the sector’s competitiveness compared to imported eggs from third countries, and, most likely, production being stopped or greatly scaled down. Before the final introduction of the ban, we should assess the state of implementation of the directive, as an assessment of this kind could lead to proposals for transitional solutions for the gradual withdrawal of unenriched cages without putting producers who have already complied with the regulations at a disadvantage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, Malaysia is a wonderful country with age-old traditions and cultural riches. As members of the ASEAN delegation, we have frequently seen for ourselves how quickly and remarkably this country has grown. The resulting increase in economic power has led to Malaysia achieving top ten ranking when it comes to world growth rates, a fact that has greatly impressed us. It is for this reason that I would like to state on behalf of my own group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, as well as all those here who signed the resolution, that we find it impossible to understand why Malaysia still practises this outmoded method of chastisement, which harkens back to the country’s colonial past and which seems almost mediaeval to us in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are not alone in voicing this criticism: lawyers in Malaysia itself are equally opposed to the practice. Caning violates all United Nations human rights agreements and we believe that things need to change quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">We welcomed the charter of the ASEAN states, which emphasises in several articles and the preamble that – and I quote – ‘the promotion and protection of human rights’ is among the essential requirements of the ASEAN Charter, which has also been ratified by Malaysia.</p>
      <p sl="de">Malaysia has long espoused democratic principles. However, this also involves the rule of law with universal standards. This is something we shall repeat again and again when we are in Malaysia and the ASEAN states, and the European Parliament will underline this with this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the practice of caning – the hitting of a person with a cane – is a form of corporal punishment that is often applied in Malaysia and this is a reason for concern, because tens of thousands of people are subject to this kind of punishment, particularly immigrants, and the list of offences that can lead to caning is growing. Malaysia is thus violating its commitment to Resolution 8/8 of the UN Human Rights Council, which states that corporal punishment can be tantamount to torture.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legal process leading to this form of punishment is often lacking and immigrants are not being informed about the charges against them, or are being denied the right of access to legal counsel.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the outspoken call by the Malaysian Bar Association – which represents 8 000 lawyers – for the abolition of caning.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this resolution condemns the practice of caning in Malaysia. The term caning should not be understood to mean an outmoded, harmless educational instrument, but is rather a horrific, demeaning and humiliating punishment, which is banned under the UN Convention against Torture. Anyone who doubts this should take a look at a video showing how this punishment is meted out in Malaysia. In terms of their brutality and horror, these images are nothing other than documentary evidence of torture. Malaysia uses this horrific and humiliating practice to punish at least 66 misdemeanours and approximately 1 000 people are beaten in the country’s gaols every year. In addition, in recent years, this brutal treatment has also been extended to migrants entering the country without papers and to drug addicts. It is estimated that a group of between 350 000 and 900 000 people are affected. We therefore urgently call on the Malaysian Government immediately to desist from this horrific, demeaning and humiliating practice and to repeal the relevant laws in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="de">Malaysia is a member of the UN Human Rights Council. As the previous speaker pointed out, this body also equates the application of corporal punishment with torture. For this reason, Malaysia would do well to remain in this body, but also to uphold the principles represented there.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Malaysia has moved towards a more Islamic form of governance in recent years. This is of some concern because Malaysia could be an important ally for the EU, being a strategically placed democratic Asian country with a developed economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, Western concepts of human rights are less developed in Malaysia. However, I am unsure as to why we have singled out Malaysia here. Malaysia is a Muslim majority country and such punishments are commonplace in many Sharia law-based countries, and are mandated by the Koran which serves as the ultimate legal authority for all Muslims.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, caning is a relatively mild punishment compared to some of the other extremely brutal methods of punishment used in some Muslim countries, including amputation, lapidation and beheading. Caning should also be seen in the Asian cultural context: for example, neighbouring secular Singapore also sentences criminals to caning, and the Indonesian province of Aceh, which receives a lot of EU aid, has recently introduced caning under its Sharia law policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In EU Member States, traditional implementation of corporal punishment is rightly banned, and let us hope that Malaysia one day will follow our enlightened example. But it is not at all clear in my mind that caning is illegal under international law, as stated in the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Tannock, caning in Malaysia was not introduced by Sharia law, but is a carryover from British colonial times. Just as British colonial power no longer exists and Great Britain has changed in the meantime, Malaysia must also change and try to abolish this antiquated and barbaric punishment, which violates international law and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want to be very clear on this. For decades, Malaysia has been a country characterised by tolerance between the various ethnic groups and religious communities. The country should stick to this path and it will do so as a particularly close partner of the European Union, which we hope will succeed in banning this barbaric form of punishment.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am not an international lawyer, but I can see no evidence whatsoever that international law forbids caning. It is very clear that it forbids war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and so on, but caning, in my view, is not forbidden by international law. The Convention on Torture, which Malaysia has not actually ratified, says that caning could amount to torture but is not always necessarily torture. So could Bernd perhaps explain to me why caning is illegal – as he stated again and as it is stated in the resolution – and against international law.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Malaysia is one of those states for which cooperation with the European Union, although recent and relatively modest, appears to be rather positive. This is particularly true in economic terms of course, but also socially, in relation to education, women’s rights and the most vulnerable populations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, when it comes to democracy and human rights, the situation is far from ideal. Worrying signs persist. The situation we are discussing today is an unfortunate illustration of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While Malaysia has signed a number of international conventions, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), it still refuses to sign others and, in particular, the International Convention against Torture. Malaysia is one of the countries that apply the death penalty; indeed, this is a mandatory sentence for drug trafficking convictions. Corporal punishment is common practice in Malaysia and can be administered to anyone: men, women – notably those who are accused of illicit sexual relationships – and even children, for schoolchildren guilty of serious disobedience. What is worse, for those who are sentenced to receive such punishment, it is carried out with the help of doctors, in violation of their medical ethics, with said doctors being responsible for resuscitating the offenders before they suffer the rest of their sentence. Worse still, in recent years, the Malaysian Parliament has extended the list of criminal offences that are punishable by caning. Today, there are over 60 of them, including illegal entry into the country. In addition, since 2002, when this offence was created, thousands of refugees have suffered this punishment, this torture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Malaysian Government must stop these practices. At a time when the European Union’s dialogue with Malaysia seems to be bearing fruit, should the European Union not do everything possible to persuade Malaysia to make progress in this area?</p>

At least 10 000 convicts and at least 6 000 refugees are caned each year in Malaysia. There are numerous canings in detention facilities, and Mr Tannock has said that, unfortunately, Malaysia is not the only country in which anachronistic punishments of this type are applied: there is also talk of Singapore.</p>
      <p sl="ro">What is, however, problematic in the case of Malaysia is the fact that a more significant number of crimes and offences attract a caning sentence: to be more precise, 66 in Malaysia, compared with 30 in Singapore. We are talking not only about violent or sexual crimes, but also drug taking, and especially infringements of immigration provisions. I concur, on the other hand, with the perspective that my colleague, Mr Posselt, has embraced, saying that we are talking about torture, which is absolutely prohibited under international law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are pleased by Malaysia’s economic development and the improved living conditions of the Malaysian people. At the same time, however, we are incredulous at Amnesty International’s report describing the widespread use of the punishment of caning in Malaysia. This really is a harsh punishment, use of which is often over the top, as it is sometimes meted out for minor and very dubious offences. In my opinion, it is particularly cruel to hand down this sentence to illegal immigrants or people found on Malaysian territory without valid documents, including political refugees from Burma.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The ruthless nature of this punishment, however, conceals the unspoken truth regarding the traditional conditions and nature of the punishment of caning as practised in Malaysia. Many of the misdemeanours which carry the punishment of caning are related to violations of Islamic religious law and customs deriving from this law. An example of this is the case of Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, who was sentenced to caning in 2009 for drinking beer in a bar. The situation requires our response.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, traditional Islamic Sharia law, which is applied even in many moderate Islamic countries, permits corporal punishment for infringements of the law.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There was the notorious case from Malaysia of a punishment of six strokes of the cane imposed on the model Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno for being caught drinking beer. After the announcement of the punishment, however, which was to have been performed with a rattan cane in a women’s prison, the punishment of six blows of the cane, handed down to a 32 year old mother of two children, was commuted to three months’ community service on the basis of a ruling by the Malaysian sultan, Ahmed Shah, who supervises compliance with Islamic rules in Malaysia.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Things went rather worse, however, for 46 year old Indonesian, Nasarudin Kamaruddin, who got 6 blows of the cane and one year in prison for the same offence. Judge Abdul Rahman Mohamed Yunos, who also sentenced Kartika Shukarno, said of the judgment ‘The aim of the verdict is not to punish but to teach’.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A similar argument was used in defence of his ruling by Wee Ka Siong, Deputy Education Minister, when he justified the corporal punishment of children in schools, adding that the punishment could be carried out only by directors of schools or assigned persons, that parents would be informed about a punishment, and that a witness would be present when the punishment was carried out.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, what we are talking about is nothing exotic. It is everyday life in the so-called moderate Islamic world.

The Malaysian Government has recently added yet more crimes to the list of those punishable by caning, and the punishment is meted out for as many as 66 different misdemeanours. Prisoners sentenced to caning are detained in prison without any idea of when their punishment will be carried out. Amnesty International estimates that around 10 000 sentences of caning are handed down every year, and that 60% of those sentenced are illegal immigrants who do not even understand the punishment due to the language barrier. The country’s authorities do not see any need to change the law, however, as they regard caning as an effective way to fight crime.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union has been cooperating closely with Malaysia for eight years. EUR 17 million were earmarked in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective to develop the Malaysian economy. It is therefore justified to call on our partner to ratify the UN Convention against Torture, and to condemn in no uncertain terms the practice of caning as incompatible with the position of the UN Human Rights Council.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, more than 10 000 citizens are whipped or caned annually in Malaysia, where the legislation stipulates this punishment officially for 66 infringements. The list of these crimes has been extended in the last few years, which indicates a worrying tendency. The victims are both local and foreign, with numerous and grave abuses being committed against the latter, from the absence of the necessary information or an interpreter to the violation of professional ethics by doctors and the absence of legal assistance.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I, too, urge European institutions to intensify their efforts in relation to the abolition of this punishment which, under international law, is the equivalent of torture, and to exert pressure to bring about the observance of the right to an objective and impartial trial in Malaysia and the end of the mean treatment of migrants and asylum seekers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission condemns the use of corporal punishment. It conflicts with international human rights principles and norms, as set out by the United Nations. These principles are also reflected in the European Union guidelines for EU policy towards third countries on torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent report by Amnesty International on the practice of caning in Malaysia is worrying. However, the Commission would like to suggest widening the resolution to cover all countries where judicial caning unfortunately still occurs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union, together with the United Nations, has quite regularly raised the question of caning with Malaysia. Some Member States also did so in the context of the ratification of the UN Convention against Torture and during the UN Human Rights Council’s universal periodic review, which took place in February 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">Only last week, at the United Nations seminar on the occasion of Human Rights Day, Malaysia was urged to ratify more UN conventions, in particular, the UN Convention against Torture. In early 2010, the same question was raised by the EU Head of Mission directly with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is an issue to which we pay a lot of attention. The European Union and Malaysia will soon begin negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement, which will contain provisions on human rights. Once this agreement enters into force, it will provide a sound formalised basis for a reinforced and regular dialogue with Malaysia on human rights. In the meantime, we will continue raising this issue with the Malaysian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, exactly one year ago, we adopted a resolution in this House concerning gays and lesbians and the Bahati Bill in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Why return, one year later, with an almost identical resolution?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Because the problem is far from solved. Firstly, the evangelist movement ‘The Family’, which was behind this Bahati Bill, has not given up, and we can still see this bill reappearing in Uganda.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second reason is that, last October and November, Uganda’s Rolling Stone newspaper carried out a name and shame campaign and published a list of Ugandan homosexuals, who were immediately tracked down and attacked and are still in hiding as outcasts today. The Ugandan Constitutional Court has stopped the publication of this newspaper but it is clear that the atmosphere has deteriorated. This is a manhunt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, only 13 African countries recognise homosexuals’ rights. The remaining countries have very different laws, but some of them – Sudan, northern Nigeria, Mauritania – still punish homosexuals with death.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet, and I shall end with this, very recently, the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries made a statement – a somewhat one-sided one in my view – to the effect that they were aware that this issue regarding homosexuals bothered us slightly, but that these aspects were part of their culture. No, they are human rights, they are universal values, and we really do want these universal values to be strongly defended by the Commission and by the entire European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, societies in Africa are, in general, socially conservative. In many African countries, sadly, homosexuality is indeed outlawed. Many people in Africa feel threatened by efforts to promote homosexuality, particularly when those efforts are led by NGOs and organisations based in the west. There is a widely held perception in some parts of Africa that liberal democracies are trying to push their own, more tolerant, values on societies with very different and ancient traditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, be that as it may, it does not excuse or justify the rampant homophobia that exists widely in some parts of Africa. Sadly, this homophobia is often stirred up by governments and their media mouthpieces. Uganda is yet again in the news for the extremism and hysteria of some of its legislators. They are supporting a bill that would impose the death penalty, or life imprisonment, on homosexuals, depending on the nature of their so-called crime. I, like the ECR Group, reject this draconian bill, which would be an atrocious violation of individual rights, and call on President Museveni to veto it. Uganda is a country in which the majority of people survive on a dollar a day: surely the country’s legislators can find better ways to serve the interests of Ugandan society than to make gays subject to criminal prosecution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the so-called Anti-Homosexuality Bill before the Ugandan Parliament provides for the punishment of homosexual acts by imprisonment for terms ranging from seven years to life, or even the death penalty. The European Parliament strongly condemns this bill and, in so doing, we are not imposing European values on other states, as some have suggested, in an attempt to avoid responsibility for human rights violations and responsibility for protecting citizens from being attacked on the basis of their sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The real threat and the climate of fear were underlined in the October and November issues of Rolling Stone , a local newspaper, which listed the names and personal details of people alleged to be homosexual, inciting readers to harm or hang them. Several people were consequently attacked.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, homosexuality is legal in only 13 African countries and it is a criminal offence in 38 others. In Mauritania, Sudan and northern Nigeria, it is punishable by death.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Ugandan authorities are obliged, in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement, to observe international and human rights, and the Commission, the Council of the European Union and the External Action Service should also make full use of the toolkit for promoting and protecting the enjoyment of human rights by all LGBT people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Anti-Homosexuality Bill by David Bahati in the Ugandan Parliament that provides for the punishment of homosexual acts by imprisonment of between seven years and life, as well as the death penalty, is simply unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us remember that in Africa, legal homosexuality only exists in 13 countries, and is a criminal offence in 38 countries, whilst in Mauritania, Sudan and northern Nigeria, homosexuality is punished by death.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why we need to reiterate once again the fact that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual’s rights of privacy. It is guaranteed by international human rights law, according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted, while freedom of expression should be guaranteed. This is why we need to denounce again any attempt to incite hatred and advocate violence towards any minority group, including on grounds of sex or sexual orientation. We need to remind the Ugandan authorities of their obligations under international law and under the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why I also ask the Commission and the Council, and the European External Action Service as well, to make full use of the toolkit to promote and protect the enjoyment of full human rights by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in their dealings with Uganda.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the attempts being made to discriminate against Ugandan citizens on the grounds of their sexual orientation are a serious matter. On this issue, Uganda has the support of many African countries which do not want the international community or the European Union to exert pressure on them to decriminalise homosexuality.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The misunderstanding is based on the fact that we believe that a ban on discrimination in this area is a universal human right, as Mrs De Keyser said before. The majority of African countries do not see it the same way, and this is why dialogue is so difficult. We say that we cannot remain silent on such matters, and they say that we are interfering in things that have nothing to do with us.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The draft amendments to Ugandan legislation really do represent a radical change. They introduce the possible use of the death penalty for repeated infringements of the prohibitions already in place, or for aggravated homosexuality, although it is not, in fact, clear what this is supposed to mean. We do not agree with these proposals, and we hope that they will not be passed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Uganda is one of the African states where homosexuality is still severely repressed. Indeed, it has one of the most notorious and harshest reputations in this area, since Uganda, under the leadership of American fundamentalist evangelists, of which the Ugandan Head of State is a close associate, has launched a veritable crusade against homosexuals. We have lost count of the numbers of people who have suffered persecution and torture simply because of their sexuality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Muslims and Christians have united – a first in the country – to condemn this abomination. Christopher Senyonjo, a 70-year-old Anglican bishop, was banned from officiating by his superiors for having been one of the few to have taken a stand in favour of homosexuals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The bill already mentioned may indeed reappear at any time. It goes as far as to sentence to death homosexuals suspected of being HIV positive or of having relations with minors. It calls for them to be reported.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The local newspaper Rolling Stone , which has nothing to do with the magazine of the same name, actually published lists with the names and addresses of gay leaders under the revolting headline: ‘Hang them!’ The publication of this rag has been temporarily banned, but the damage has been done, as has already been said.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Africa, homosexuality is very often seen as an evil from the West which is causing Africa to lose its ancestral values. NGOs say that 500 000 of the 32 million inhabitants of Uganda are gay. Many of them apply for asylum in European countries. Could we at least do our best to ensure that special consideration is given to these applications, and indeed to all men and women who are victims of oppression and torture?</p>

The death penalty could be used, while association and expression of LGBT issues would be effectively banned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new bill will increase the climate of fear and hostility in a country where persecution of LGBT people is already under way.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course, much has changed in this last year. On 23 November, this House itself reiterated the principle of the universality of human rights and non-discrimination as a basis on which to enhance our partnership with the JPA. This House also called for the reinforcement of the principle of non-negotiable human rights clauses and sanctions for failure to respect such clauses, inter alia, with regard to discrimination, etc. based on sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that these countries choose to work with us. They choose to have partnerships with us. We have the ACP JPA, we have the Cotonou Agreements. Therefore, we are asking them to engage with us on shared, universal principles. These are non-negotiable. If they do not want to operate on that basis, I call on the Commission and the Council to take the necessary sanctions to reinforce the fact that we have principles which we will stand up for. Equally, in the future of the EU-Africa Strategic Partnership, we urge that all actions conducted under the terms of the various partnerships be pursued without discrimination on any grounds, including sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not colonialism to stand up for the rights of others. Human rights are universal and indivisible, and to stand back and do nothing when somebody else’s basic human rights are attacked is to be complicit in that action. You cannot promote homosexuality in Africa. Anyone in Africa who woke up and said: ‘Today I am going to be homosexual’ would be insane. Their life would be under threat and their family would have to turn them in to the police. Imagine you are that person and take the action necessary to defend those rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, ban discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The European Union not only has obligations in relation to human rights within its territory, but also an international duty to insist on compliance with these rights and to criticise abuses when dealing with third countries, particularly when we provide financial support through the European Development Fund to third countries like Uganda, which have entered into partnership agreements with us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Accordingly, we actually have the right to comment when these third countries fail to meet the human rights requirements set down in such partnership agreements. Hence, Uganda must respect international human rights standards because it was party to the Cotonou Agreement, which sets down our organised development aid to the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">Just one year ago, we called on Uganda not to follow through on its plans for a law to criminalise homosexuals. One year on, the situation has deteriorated. There is still the threat of long prison sentences or even the death penalty. With others, I myself demonstrated in front of the Ugandan Embassy in May of this year. This had no effect.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is an interesting and important debate. I would like to draw your attention to two problems. Firstly, the fact of the matter is that Uganda is not an island of discrimination in a sea of respect for human rights. Three quarters of African countries have extremely harsh regulations on this issue, which are tantamount to discrimination. This is unquestionably not so much Uganda’s problem as a wider problem involving the whole continent and African culture. The second question is as follows: it goes without saying that Uganda does not lead the field in respect for human rights in Africa. We know of many examples of violations of human rights, which means that this matter is part of a wider problem, and we must, of course, speak openly about this problem.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, our resolution is aimed at extremely serious cases of human rights violations and, unfortunately, the punishment of homosexuality as a criminal offence is the norm in Africa. This is reflected in the legislation of 38 states, with only 13 African states considering it legal.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, the bill attempting to enforce certain sanctions in Uganda, from prison sentences to capital punishment, represents a serious attack against human rights, including the right to privacy. The publication in a local newspaper of a black list of 100 individuals accused of homosexuality and the incitement of readers to hang them is an example of a concrete threat to a community blamed for its sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As indicated in our resolution, our measure is not aimed, as we are often accused, at the imposition of specifically European values, but at the defence of human rights, which is one of the major objectives of the European Union. I believe that in this sense, the European External Action Service and the other European institutions need to impose more severe sanctions in order to ensure compliance with the international agreements to which Uganda is a signatory.</p>

It remains blocked in the Committee on Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, and all the international pressure exerted did not manage, in the end, to bring about this effect, namely, the withdrawal of the project.</p>
      <p sl="ro">What is truly horrific, and some of my fellow Members have already expanded on this, is the anti-gay campaign that is taking place in this country.

We welcome, too, the efforts made by the Egyptian Government to investigate the allegations and secure the refugees’ release, but we should also be focusing on why these unfortunate individuals flee in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The answer is because the regime of Eritrean President Afewerki is one of the most repressive on the planet. Anyone with a chance of fleeing his dictatorship does so, and some are able to build a better life for themselves elsewhere. Those unable to leave Eritrea are either subject to open-ended conscription in the army, or have to scratch out a living on the fringes of an economy bankrupted by years of futile war with neighbouring Ethiopia, widespread corruption and mismanagement of the economy. Eritrea has never held a national election.</p>

We are talking about criminal networks that have no consideration at all for human dignity, as the lives of these people become a bargaining chip.

Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the vulnerable situation of women, who are repeatedly subjected to rape.

This means that we should recognise the efforts undertaken by the Egyptian authorities for their release and, in particular, support this country in the fight against human trafficking.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation of the Eritrean refugees currently in the Sinai desert is very serious, as has already been described by several fellow Members. Naturally, we must deal severely with the human traffickers who are currently holding these refugees hostage and demanding extremely high ransoms for them. However, at the same time, we must also protect the victims, because we cannot just want to deal harshly with the traffickers and then completely forget the victims. We also need to acknowledge the reasons that led them to be in the Sinai desert: their migratory route used to be through Libya, but the agreements between Italy and Libya, and between the EU and Libya, portrayed so many times here by the Commission as good news, mean that people coming from what has – quite rightly – been called a ‘giant concentration camp’ and ‘Africa’s North Korea’ have nowhere to run.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Action is needed, therefore: not just action in Egypt, which is clearly doing far less than it should be, but also in the European Union itself. To start with, I call on the European Commission to quickly send a delegation to Egypt in order to find out what the situation is on the ground. Action is also needed in all our institutions, because Eritreans are a clear case for resettlement, a policy that we have alongside the European Refugee Fund. These refugees cannot return to Eritrea and cannot remain in a transit country: the only solution is resettlement. Ladies and gentlemen, do you know why the resettlement package is not moving forward? It is not moving forward because in May, Parliament had already done its part of the codecision procedure on the resettlement case, but because of the famous dispute over delegated acts, the Council refused to do its bit. If the resettlement package had been adopted, we would now have the emergency procedure that Parliament inserted into the report that I myself wrote and which was adopted here with 500 votes: the European Commission would be able to start an emergency procedure to resettle these refugees. As the Council did not do its part in what we should be calling ‘a co-indecision procedure’, those people are in the Sinai desert, who knows for how long? This co-indecision procedure has consequences for the real lives of real people and it is time that the Council did its share of the chores.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is thanks to a telephone call between an Eritrean priest in Italy and an Eritrean hostage that the European public learned that unprincipled human traffickers are now threatening to shoot the stranded Eritrean hostages if a ransom is not paid. The hostage takers have shown no scruples and have already beaten or shot some people.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brutal crime prompted a closer look at what is happening at the border between Egypt and Israel, an area in which an increasing number of refugees are stranded as they try to enter Europe or Israel, but lack the necessary papers. There is a military exclusion zone on the Egyptian side. Anyone entering this area will be answerable to a military tribunal. According to Human Rights Watch, at least 85 unarmed refugees have been shot there since 2007, trying to cross the border. The Israeli Government talks of more than 1 000 migrants trying to enter their country without papers each month and has started to increase security and monitoring along the border. In addition, a large detention camp has been set up in the Negev Desert.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are calling on the relevant governments to cooperate with the United Nations Refugee Agency and to guarantee the protection and rights of refugees at their borders. However, we also clearly recognise that we in Europe have a responsibility for the fate of those migrants who are turned away from our outer borders and who find themselves unable to return to their homes, suffering human rights violations as a consequence, as in the case of these Eritrean refugees.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the situation of the Eritrean refugees in Sinai is tragic. They are looking for a better life, but they often meet with death, torture and oppression. They are exploited and cheated. The Egyptian authorities are attempting to fight the problem of human trafficking, but their response is not always effective. We must help the refugees, the hostages and all those who need our help. We should support the Israeli and Egyptian authorities in their fight against human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is also worth giving some thought to the reasons behind these dangerous occurrences. I believe that we should aim to improve the situation in Eritrea itself and in other countries in the Horn of Africa, since improving the situation in African countries may reduce migratory pressure. We will not solve the problem by combating the social ills which are themselves caused by migration. We can only limit the less desirable effects, and the extent to which the determination of refugees is preyed upon. I would ask you to support the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We are convinced that our motion for a resolution is an improvement on the joint resolution in this instance.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Egypt is not just turning a blind eye to the horrific treatment and exploitation of African refugees attempting to escape over Sinai to Israel from their countries, specifically Somalia and Eritrea. Egypt is also deporting them, even though they obviously qualify as refugees and asylum seekers, as they come either from one country that is in a terrible struggle with terrorism and without law or order, or from another – Eritrea – that is one of the most oppressive and tyrannical in the world. In fact, the Egyptian authorities are practising a policy of shoot to kill and 85 migrants have already died in Sinai since 2007, according to a Human Rights Watch report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We call on the Egyptian authorities to comply with their obligations as regards human rights and migrants and refugees in particular, and for them to work with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. We also call on the European authorities to do the same and to fully support what Mr Tavares was saying on this subject regarding the possibility of resettlement.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest. The resolutions, as they are currently worded, are a watered down version of what we started out with at the beginning of the week.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let us once again be clear: ‘The situation is serious’. We are also highlighting the fact that Eritrean refugees in the Sinai are being held hostage. Yet, we are not prepared to discuss the links between Italy and Libya and the closing of Europe to migrants, as a result of which political refugees have had to flee to other places. They are now having to take routes which are even more dangerous than before.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Anyone who leaves Eritrea automatically becomes a political refugee, because it is impossible to go back and, if you did, you would be putting your family in danger. What pains me is that we, in this House, are not prepared to say: if Europe so badly wants to protect itself from migrants, it will have to open up its embassies in Eritrea, in order to make it easier for people to apply for asylum. We were not permitted to include that proposal in this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When I hear the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) refer to all the things that need to happen in Egypt, then I think: what is it that we have to do and how can we refuse to accept that people are at risk here, simply because we are reluctant to take on the responsibility? We are shutting people out and, in so doing, we are putting lives at risk.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Sinai border has become a route via which thousands of Eritreans fleeing their own country attempt to get a better life.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In their illegal pilgrimage for freedom, however, they are dependent on the assistance of smugglers who are willing, at a price, to help the refugees across the Sinai border, even without the necessary papers. In this lawless trade, refugees in the hands of the smuggling gangs have almost no rights at all, and are dependent on the vicissitudes of fate and on the whims of those into whose hands they have, for a fee, entrusted their own fate.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The death of seven Eritrean refugees killed on the Egyptian-Israeli border reveals to us something of the grim plight of refugees illegally journeying in search of freedom. Ladies and gentlemen, it is therefore quite right for us to engage in a solution to this problem and, together with the governments of the affected countries, to help to find a civilised solution to the problem of the Eritrean refugees.</p>

      <p sl="en">We are aware that these refugees were compelled to pay a specific amount of money for their wish to live in better conditions. Reportedly, the refugees are kept in containers in the desert and are often beaten. The attitude of the Eritrean Government itself is alarming: instead of protecting its citizens, it considers them unwanted dissidents.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, right from the outset, I wish to emphasise that I support without reservation the resolution put forward by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Despite the clarity of the text, an agreement has not been reached with the other groups for the adoption of a common resolution, which is regrettable. The situation in the Horn of Africa is an alarming one. This region has become one of the important action centres of organised crime groups, given the high number of African emigrants in transit in this area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The 250 hostages have suffered an inhuman and degrading treatment, and their situation is getting worse. Moreover, the prerequisites of an imminent release do not exist, as the families of the hostages cannot pay the requested ransom. Therefore, the European Parliament should send out a clear message for their release. Urgent action must be taken against criminal organisations, they should be brought to justice, and torture camps should be permanently closed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, naturally, I deeply condemn the way the Eritrean refugees are treated, and likewise of course, I support the fact that the European Union should take steps to resolve the situation of these refugees as soon as possible. However, the direction formulated in this report is, to put it simply, a dead end. I consider two points to be utterly bewildering. That we set up a fund in order to aid these refugees is completely acceptable to me insofar as there are currently millions of citizens in the EU living in existential uncertainty and extreme poverty. Over three million people in Hungary are living below the poverty line, the majority of pensioners cannot afford to pay for their medicine and, as a matter of fact, this trend has been on the rise across Europe. Therefore, we should first be looking to help people in Europe while, at the same time, also expressing our empathy with the refugees, of course. The other issue is that Member States should admit the refugees voluntarily. When will you realise that the European Union is saturated with immigrants? The EU should act as a mediator between Eritrea and the Eritrean refugees to ensure their safe return home.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the vast majority of Eritrean citizens that can now be found in the Sinai Desert have fled out of the way of an oppressive regime and, as such, should be regarded as refugees according to UN standards. Therefore, I believe that we need to insist that Egypt meets its international obligations to provide them with assistance. However, the matter of greatest concern, I believe, is the inhumane treatment these migrants are subjected to when held as hostages in the desert in expectation of a ransom. In particular, the claims of rape by dozens of women are revolting and should mobilise the international community.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the same way, human trafficking in Africa has reached alarming proportions. Dozens of migrants were killed by Egyptian security services in recent years while attempting to cross illegally into Israel. I believe that human trafficking in this area should be combated with other methods, and I think that access on the part of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is necessary in order to ensure vital assistance for these people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Eritrean refugees are in a tragic situation. When considering this tragedy, however, we should also remember the reason for this state of affairs. The fact of the matter is that fundamental human rights are widely violated in Eritrea. Mass persecution occurs on a huge scale, with political opponents, Christians and also thousands of ordinary people as victims. This is the real reason behind the tragic problem we are discussing today, and this is why we must do everything to change the EU’s policy towards the Eritrean authorities, all the more so when we remember that the current leader of the country was warmly welcomed in Brussels by the European Commission in 2007, even though he is responsible for such terrible suffering by so many people, which forces them to flee and brings about ever more tragedies of this kind. This is why it is time for a pragmatic and decisive policy towards this tyrant.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament. The reports received speak of several hundred refugees, from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia, apparently being held hostage in Sinai by traffickers requesting hard payment for their release.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the first notification, we have been following the case, establishing the facts, assessing the situation and taking appropriate action. The European Union delegation in Cairo has close contacts with local civil-society organisations and liaises with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ regional representation in Cairo.</p>
      <p sl="en">They are very much following the case. In coordination with the embassies of the EU Member States, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been approached. The EU has expressed our concerns, as well as our strong belief, that the Egyptian authorities should take appropriate measures to liberate these people and grant them appropriate protection. There are reports of ongoing investigations to find the group of refugees, and we hope that things will be clearer in the next few days.</p>
      <p sl="en">This case is not the only cause for concern. Migrants and refugees in Egypt still suffer from many protection gaps. The most serious incidents are reported in the Sinai. Many migrants intending to cross to Israel via the Sinai border are subject to abuse and mistreatment. We have raised this issue several times with our Egyptian counterparts in the framework of the regular subcommittee meetings discussing either migration issues or political affairs, including human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The latest occasion when the point was raised was at the meeting of the EU-Egypt Association Committee on 14 December in Cairo. The EU has regularly invited Egyptian authorities to improve the quality of the assistance and protection offered to asylum seekers and refugees, and has offered financial and technical assistance in this endeavour. The EU has also invited the Egyptian authorities to ensure that the principle of non-refoulement is observed for all migrants in need of international protection, including Eritreans.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has asked that the UNHCR be given full authorisation to implement its mandate throughout the entire territory of Egypt, including in the Sinai region. There have been some positive developments that should be stressed. In the spring of this year, Egypt adopted new legislation criminalising human trafficking and also protecting its victims.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another welcome development was the adoption of a Transplant Act, which criminalises organ trafficking. We hope that the Egyptian administration will now take effective measures to ensure efficient implementation of this legal framework, and we have offered our cooperation in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will continue to support the work of the UNHCR and civil-society organisations to ensure better living conditions, as well as proper legal protection, for migrants and refugees living in the country. We will continue to follow with care the case of the hostage refugees in Sinai and we will pursue our contacts with the Egyptian authorities in this regard.</p>
