      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the statements by the Council and the Commission: Review of the Spanish Presidency. I would like to give a warm welcome to Mr Zapatero, who will speak on behalf of the Council. Mr Zapatero, you have the floor.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am attending this debate to report to you and to take stock of what the Spanish rotating Presidency has accomplished in these six months. When I attended at the beginning of this term, I explained to you that I had two main objectives during this political period.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first of these was the implementation and entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, a treaty seeking a more complete union for Europe. The second main objective, directly related to that ambition of ever-closer unity among Europeans, was to achieve, with a view to the recovery of the economic situation, a much deeper union with regard to economic policy, to address the imbalances in our economies and to create more appropriate conditions for the European Union to improve its competitiveness and maintain its well-being.</p>
      <p sl="es">These have been the two main objectives. I can assure you that, in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon, the Spanish rotating Presidency has discharged its functions dutifully to ensure the new institutional balance and to strengthen the new institutions that we Europeans have created for ourselves through the Treaty of Lisbon: namely, the Presidency of the European Council, the purpose of which is to strengthen European representation and ensure the continuity of political programmes within the framework of the European Union, and the High Representative, intended to strengthen common action in matters of foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">This new institutional balance also includes a fundamental watershed in the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon. This watershed is the new role of this Parliament: a step forward in its powers to represent Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Throughout these six months, Mr President, we have endeavoured to be faithful to the letter and spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon with Parliament, with the new President of the Council, and in dialogue that has always been fruitful, always positive and always easy to put into practice with the European Commission. I mention the European Commission last to remind Parliament that in its founding spirit and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon lies the defence of the Community institutions and the Community method, as the final guarantee of the essence and advance of the European Union. This strengthening of and co-responsibility with the Community institutions has always been, and always will be, present in Spain and within the Spanish Government.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the Spanish rotating Presidency has learnt anything from the Treaty of Lisbon, it is that we need as much Community method as possible, and we need to strengthen the role of the major Community institutions, in terms of action and co-responsibility for the main European issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, I told you that, without a doubt, the economy – the economic crisis and the desire to put in place a common economic policy and greater economic union – had been a fundamental objective of the European Presidency. I would like to emphasise that we have produced results of great significance during this period.</p>
      <p sl="es">There has been a substantial advance in economic governance. The clearest evidence of this is that new instruments have been put in place to deal with difficult situations: new cooperation instruments hitherto unknown within the Union, such as support for the problematic situation of the sovereign debt in Greece, or the financial stability instrument approved by the Council and by Ecofin, and implemented by the 27 countries of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">During this period, as you know, we have also adopted a common strategy for growth and employment to 2020. This is a strategy in which we have collaborated by giving support to the Commission. It is a more ambitious strategy for our competitiveness, for innovation, for job creation and for social inclusion, and a strategy with new governance. While Lisbon had a problem with governance, the EU 2020 strategy is designed to strengthen new operational principles for ensuring that both the objectives of the Union as a whole and the individual objectives of each country are met.</p>
      <p sl="es">Alongside this, we have consolidated a new framework for the Stability and Growth Pact during this period, the details of which have still to be worked out. A new framework for ensuring more rigorous compliance with the Stability Pact, with new criteria and new mechanisms for preventative action and guarantees by European institutions</p>
      <p sl="es">Also during this period, we have decisively facilitated the progress of a package of new regulations in the area of finance. We know that the crisis had a financial origin, not within our borders, but in the United States. We know that it had major repercussions on our financial institutions, and today we can say that, in practical terms, the financial supervision aspects have been greatly improved thanks to the decisive intervention of Parliament. In a few months, we will have a new regulatory framework for financial supervision, which will cover all financial products and ensure solutions in crisis situations. It will contain many more prevention mechanisms in the face of what may be systemic risks.</p>
      <p sl="es">In line with this, I also applaud the decision of the European Council to improve confidence in European financial institutions through the publication of ‘stress tests’ for our banks. There is no doubt that this transparency formula will enable some of the confidence that has been called into question during this period to be restored.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there have been substantial advances with regard to economic union. I would just like to state that these advances should, in my opinion, be permanent because of two fundamental factors, which, in particular as a consequence of the economic crisis, have been the subject of profound public political debate and reflection among Europeans during this period.</p>
      <p sl="es">One relates to the strengthening of the Stability and Growth Pact, in both its preventive and its corrective aspects, in order to apply both incentives and sanctions, as the Spanish rotating Presidency advocated from the outset. The other relates to the macro-economic supervision that is developing indicators for evaluating competitiveness and imbalances within the framework of coordinated action.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to emphasise the institutional balance, as I did at the beginning of this speech. As the first rotating Presidency since the Treaty of Lisbon, I have to say that we signed a good treaty. It is a better treaty. It is a treaty that seeks the closest possible union. However, it is a treaty that requires great political will from all 27 Member States. It requires the 27 governments to have the political will to hand over powers to the President of the European Council, to give ever more capacity for initiative to the Commission and, of course, to recognise the now decisive, pivotal role that the European Parliament has.</p>
      <p sl="es">And if the Treaty of Lisbon is, above all, the way towards the closest possible union, even the closest union of Europeans will not be real or visible if it is not recognised from outside. The road towards the closest possible union will therefore necessarily involve a foreign policy with ever more unity, ever more common ground, and a strengthening of the single voice that many of us pro-Europeans would like Europe to have in the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to this, allow me to make a very brief reference to the steps that we have taken towards this objective of strengthening foreign policy. Firstly, in April, the rotating Presidency fulfilled the mandate of the European Council by adopting a political decision on the European External Action Service. On 21 June of this year, Parliament, the Council and the Commission reached a political agreement on the launch of the new European External Action Service, on which Parliament needs to state its position in plenary during this very part-session. I hope the result will be positive, as, without a doubt, this is a new and important pillar of the common foreign and security policy that we would like to have.</p>
      <p sl="es">Alongside this, our Presidency has given its active backing to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who has taken part with the Commission and the Council in the preparations for a number of summits during this period – with Russia, Japan, Pakistan, Canada, Morocco, Latin America and the Caribbean. These have borne important fruit in the form of commercial agreements that strengthen the economic position of the European Union, open up prospects in many Latin American countries and, without a doubt, extend the already strong links between the European continent and Latin America in cultural, economic, political and social areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the same way, we have strengthened neighbourhood relations. We have held a summit with Russia and, although we have not held one with the United States as was on our initial agenda, I must point out that we have reached a number of very significant agreements with the United States during this period. These include agreements on the fight against terrorism and legally and politically far-reaching agreements such as the SWIFT Agreement, in which this Parliament also played a decisive part – in a matter that was certainly not easy – and on which it needs to announce its position in plenary during this part-session. There was also an economically important agreement signed on 24 June relating to air services between the United States and the European Union, known as the ‘open skies agreement’, which will see the creation of a common transatlantic aviation area, accounting for 60% of global passenger traffic.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the Mediterranean area, one of the areas that is very sensitive for the European Union, as you know, the Presidency, in agreement with the institutions, decided to postpone the Union summit on the Mediterranean provisionally until November, in the light of the conflict situation that existed in the area. We also believe that attempting to hold this Union summit on the Mediterranean in June might have entailed a risk of failure for the Union, and that there is likely to be a much more suitable and constructive time for the role that the Union needs to play in the Mediterranean, which is to contribute to dialogue in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would emphasise that, under our Presidency, cooperation policy was discussed in the European Council for the first time during a specific debate within this august institution. In events that were of great interest to citizens and had a major impact because of their destructive power, such as the earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, the Presidency had a significant presence within the cooperation and solidarity effort, in coordination with the Commission, the Member States and the High Representative.</p>
      <p sl="es">There have been important advances in the process of negotiation with Croatia, with the closure of three chapters and the opening of five. With regard to Turkey, chapter twelve was also opened. The process of negotiation of the Association and Stabilisation Agreement with Serbia was unfrozen, as a result of which all Balkan countries are currently involved in the process of European integration, and the European prospects of the Balkans have seen an important advance.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the same way, negotiations have been opened with Iceland, as approved by the last European Council, after overcoming the reservations of some Member States. That is very good news for that country and demonstrates that Europe is continuing to grow, and that the European Union continues to be a magnet for all neighbouring countries, and therefore a great model of stability and progress for the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to end, Mr President, by making a very brief reference to some of the initiatives linked directly to the expansion of the European Union in the context of citizenship. We have taken steps towards launching the citizens’ initiative, as is well known; its implementation, through negotiations that need to be held with this House, will be a major commitment with regard to citizens’ participation in the process of European integration. We unanimously approved the mandate for the Union’s membership of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which was a major priority of the European Presidency, and we have taken steps in the fight against gender violence and in favour of equality, through the creation of the European Observatory, and by pushing ahead with the directive on a European protection order for victims of violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also approved the action plan for the 2010 Stockholm Programme, along with the Internal Security strategy. In other areas, we carried out an initial assessment of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, we adopted new regulations on organ donation and transplants, and we adopted the directive on cross-border healthcare. In short, these are important issues that directly concern the interests of Europeans in their extension of rights and their promotion of greater participation in the process of the formation of European political will.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to end with a very brief reflection, Mr President. We have endeavoured during these six months to address institutional changes which, of necessity, required a response involving political vision, generosity and commitment. We set out during these six months to address the consequences of a serious economic crisis, to create confidence and unity among Europeans. We have been committed to, and worked towards, strengthening the impact and presence of Europe in the world, convinced as we are that this project has greater strength and greater vitality than when it started, with such enthusiasm and such great scope for Europeans. We are convinced that, through the Treaty of Lisbon, we can make Europe lead the world again in political stability, in being an example of democratic functioning, in economic strength, in competitiveness and in maintenance of the social model.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its cooperation, and Mr Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, for the sincere example he sets of responsibility and leadership. I would like to congratulate the Commission on standing firm, on maintaining the Community spirit, and on being militant in its defence, despite the fact that we governments sometimes find that difficult. That, however, is what it means to integrate Europe, to have the interests of Europe at heart, and to know that that is the true path.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, honourable Members …</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency and the last six months have been a very special time for the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, it has been a period of profound transition, with the recent entry into force of a new treaty, which has given new powers to this Parliament, established a new relationship between the European Council and the rotating Presidency, and brought a new Commission into being, thanks to the support of this Parliament. In addition to all this, it has also been a period of great tension for the European economy, especially for the euro area. This crisis has posed us new challenges and required new responses from us.</p>
      <p sl="es">So far, we have passed the test. We have shown that we are able to take unprecedented measures to ensure the financial stability of the euro area. Thus, we have maintained the basic principles of solidarity and responsibility, approved the rescue package for Greece, established a stabilisation mechanism – EUR 750 billion – and begun to strengthen the economic governance of the European Union to avoid and prevent future crises.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to pay tribute today to Spain and its Presidency-in-Office of the Council, which has been very positive and successful, and which has taken place in a difficult and very particular context. The firm personal commitment of President Rodríguez Zapatero to Europe and to the Community spirit and method has been essential for meeting these challenges. The efforts made by all Spanish authorities have also been crucial. Thank you very much for that. I am particularly satisfied with the fact that we have worked together to achieve important results during these six months, providing the European Union with an agenda for new growth that is intelligent, sustainable and inclusive, and adopting key decisions for stabilising and strengthening the economy within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">With the adoption of the Europe 2020 strategy, we have established, for the first time, a global approach that combines an intelligent budgetary configuration with structural reforms, strengthened political and economic coordination, and the reform of our financial markets. Europe 2020 is our agenda for the European social market economy in the 21st century. It will contribute to mobilising all available tools, at all levels, for promoting the creation of jobs and taking advantage of new sources of growth.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Spanish Presidency has been instrumental in moving this agenda forward and, in particular, in reaching agreement on the five main objectives put forward by the Commission. These objectives are important. They give Europe 2020 a political message that everyone can understand and which nobody can object to: jobs, education, innovation, the environment and social integration. I would like to emphasise especially Spain’s support in reaching an agreement on the objective of the fight against poverty. Many people expressed doubts about the relevance of setting such an objective within the European framework. However, I believe that we have demonstrated with this agreement that the social dimension is an essential part of our common project.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our objectives are having a catalysing effect. They are communicated well and are well targeted. In addition, they provide us with a structure for driving and verifying progress. Following its adoption by the European Council in June, the Member States and the institutions now have the tools to apply Europe 2020 in practice, especially through the seven flagship initiatives and national reform programmes. The next challenge for all of us is to translate these into actual results.</p>
      <p sl="es">Together with the European Parliament the Spanish Presidency has also brought significant progress in the area of financial regulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I said ‘progress’, bearing in mind the positions of the Council and Parliament only six months ago. However, I did not say ‘breakthrough’. Yes, we are on the verge of an agreement on the financial supervision package but we must not lose this momentum. I call on all Member States and all Members of this House to assume their full responsibility. The target date of seeing the new system up and running by the end of the year is not just for practical convenience. It is a critical political signal. All three institutions must now make decisive moves to seal the package before the summer break. I think it would be very difficult to explain to our partners in the G20 that we, who were the first to start this process, are not able to be the first to conclude it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Presidency rightly placed great emphasis on the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty’s new instruments and I would like to highlight in particular progress on two important files.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first is the European citizens’ initiative. This will be a very concrete and tangible expression of the Lisbon Treaty’s goal to strengthen direct democracy in the European Union. The Commission strongly supports the objective of putting it in place as quickly as possible. We have been quick to make our proposal after an extensive consultation involving all relevant stakeholders. I welcome the fact that the Council, under the guidance of the Spanish Presidency, has now formulated its position and is able to enter into discussions with Parliament, which has, of course, a particular interest and legitimacy in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, during the Spanish Presidency, the Council agreed negotiating directives for the Union’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This is a powerful expression of our values and of the commitment to uphold human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to commend the Spanish contribution in promoting the external dimension of EU policies. The Presidency has helped prepare an unprecedented number of summits with Europe’s strategic partners in the world. I would like to mention in particular the remarkable results of the Latin America and Caribbean summits, where the conclusion of negotiations with the Andean Community, the signature of the Peru and Colombia agreements and the relaunch of Mercosur negotiations took place. I would also like to mention – particularly because it took place for the first time – the summit with Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also important to mention here the crucial contribution of the Spanish Presidency to the conclusion of the negotiations on the EU-US agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme. Thanks to its efforts and those of Commissioner Malmström, we now have a text that takes into consideration the European Parliament’s specific concerns. I know this House is going to debate Mr Alvaro’s report today, and I hope that new compromise and debate will bring us to a positive vote by the Parliament next Thursday.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain has also made an invaluable contribution in setting up the European External Action Service. Thanks to its efforts, the commitment of Baroness Ashton and the help of the European Parliament, we now have a political agreement which I am convinced will bring a successful External Action Service on track. The service, as it is designed, will articulate well with the work of the Parliament, Council and Commission on external relations. I therefore strongly believe that the agreement deserves the support of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">Discussion has also brought us a long way on the necessary amendments to the Staff Regulations and to the Financial Regulation, where the Council and Parliament are now ready to enter into the full codecision process. It goes without saying that Parliament will fully play its role in deciding the amending budget for 2010 and adjudicating on the amending letter for the 2011 budget, which the Commission will submit after the summer break. In the meantime, the High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission, will have the political support she needs to put the service in place.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Spanish Presidency can look back with satisfaction at a number of important achievements in times of economic, social and institutional change. During the last six months, when Europe has been confronted with unprecedented challenges, Spain has shown once again its seriousness and its European commitment in holding the Council rotating Presidency. It has made every effort to show that Europe works and delivers, tackling the issues of concern to our citizens head-on. But there is no room for complacency, and we have to continue to build solid foundations for the future. The European Commission is working on this objective with full speed, together with Parliament, the European Council and Belgium, which now holds the rotating Council Presidency and which receives from Spain a solid record of achievement. To Spain: thank you, muchas gracias .</p>

    <intervention id="2-013" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Presidents, Prime Minister, the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union has attempted to find a place for itself in a new institutional context, between the new President of the Council and High Representative and the European Parliament’s increased power as a European colegislator in its own right.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At the same time, this Presidency has come at a time of major economic difficulties for Europe, such as the crisis with the euro in Greece and a growing social unrest, as we have seen in Spain, where nearly five million people are unemployed. In this context, several advances have been made: the creation of European mechanisms for financial stabilisation, progress in the regulation of the financial markets – here, I would ask you, Prime Minister, to continue on the same path so that we get these regulations – as well as the organisation of the European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is difficult, however, to give the credit for these positive measures to such and such a rotating Presidency, the Presidency of the European Council or Parliament, and anyway, there have been various reverses or delays in these measures, as you have emphasised. I am particularly thinking of the cancellation of the summit between the United States and Europe, which was a lost opportunity to relaunch an essential transatlantic partnership. My group would like the European Council, during the summit in September on strategic partnerships, to catch up on the time that has been lost, and we propose the creation of a transatlantic market, which would surely provide a serious way of generating growth and employment on our two continents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the stakes are high, and we are therefore obliged to send signs of confidence not just to the markets, but also to Europeans: confidence in our joint capacity for innovation and for engaging in enterprise, and also confidence in Europe’s capacity to return to competitiveness, and therefore to return to growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to achieve these results, each of the Member States must play its part and take inspiration from the things that its neighbours do better. In order for the concert to be harmonious, however, we need a conductor, and this conductor must be European. My group expects European leaders to send a message of unity and confidence and to organise themselves accordingly. My group also expects the Community method to prevail over the intergovernmental method, the limitations of which have been demonstrated by the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, as you have said, we intend, even following the Spanish Presidency, to maintain the same very strong stance on this Community method. So many challenges await the Belgian Presidency, and I would recommend to them, and to all of us, that we should show humility, but also efficiency.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014" speaker_id="1911" name="Martin Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall begin with a personal, albeit very important, observation. Mr Zapatero, political logic dictates that I should be glad when Angela Merkel is sad, and that I should normally share in your gladness. Tomorrow evening, however, the reverse will be the case, for Mrs Merkel and I will celebrate together, and I shall have no sympathy for you.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Mr Cohn-Bendit will also entertain us with his faulty footballing knowledge in a short while, but now I turn to the Spanish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Zapatero, the Spanish Presidency has had some outstanding successes, about which I wish to speak at this point. The successful conclusion in the last few days, after negotiations over the European External Action Service which were, in fact, extremely difficult – this is something I wish expressly to state – has been achieved in close collaboration with Baroness Ashton, with a great deal of work from fellow Members of this House. In the closing phases, however, it was the Presidency that made the decisive contribution. This is a success of the Spanish Presidency. I should particularly like to mention your Foreign Minister, Mr Moratinos, who made a significant contribution in bringing it to a successful conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Spanish Presidency made a significant contribution to achieving the SWIFT Agreement. I should like particularly to thank Mr Rubalcaba, without whom the SWIFT Agreement would not have come about in its present form. I have the following to say to the President of the Commission. If the mechanistic thinking of the Commission and, in particular, that of Commissioner Malmström, had prevailed, we should not have had the SWIFT Agreement. The credit for this expressly belongs to Parliament and the Spanish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that we can come to a conclusion with regard to the steps that are still necessary in terms of banking supervision and financial market regulation. We have made considerable progress in this respect in these last few days. We are not at the end, but I hope that we can come to sensible compromises and sensible conclusions. Besides, we must have a leading role for Europe. We also need it because we have seen that if Europeans act as one – and this is also a success for the Spanish Presidency – then we have a great opportunity to define European standards that we can also apply internationally.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us look again at the reality of the last fortnight. The speculative attack on the euro has been deflected for the time being. What is happening? The speculators can see that European measures are protecting the currency, so they are now turning their attention to the United States and are speculating against the dollar. That would, incidentally, be a good argument for all those who were present at the G20 summit to say to the President of the United States and others that they should not think that the capitalists have only us in their sights. They turn to where they believe they can make their profit quickest. Currently, that is the dollar, but who knows, perhaps next time it will be the pound sterling or some other currency. What we need are worldwide rules. If we implement them now partially, at a European level, then we are doing the right thing, because we can then, as a powerful European Union, also implement them internationally. This is also a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Zapatero, I am grateful that, as President-in-Office of the Council, you have clearly said here that you support the Commission. I do not always have the impression that this is the case for everyone in the Council. Mr Daul is right to have referred to the defence of the Community method. What we need is a union of European institutions against this dreadful tendency towards renationalisation, which exists especially in the European Council. We must call a spade a spade, so thank you very much for singing the praises of Mr Van Rompuy. I also find him quite charming but, as a Member of this House, I must say that our interlocutor is the rotating Presidency. I have already given three examples of ways in which, with the rotating Presidency – which, incidentally, is led by politicians and not by some bureaucrats sitting within the administrative machinery in Brussels – and as politicians – and as a Minister you are also a Member of Parliament – we, as a rule, have a significantly better understanding of what happens in a parliament than some official sitting in a general secretariat, even if it is led by Mr Van Rompuy. That is why I believe that the rotating Presidency has proved its worth. Especially for us as Parliament, it is a direct interlocutor, with whom we can directly solve problems in specific legislative processes. One result of the Treaty of Lisbon, which I also consider to be a step forward, is the fact that the European institutions, if they work together, if they regard one another as mutually complementary, can have far greater success than if, as very often happens in the Council, they try to lock horns.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, the Spanish Presidency was a successful Presidency. Thank you for your efforts and thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="2-015" speaker_id="28242" name="Alexander Graf Lambsdorff" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, if football does not count, I, too, shall now make a footballing analogy. The Spanish Presidency seems to me a little like Fernando Torres’s World Cup. It began with high expectations, but hitherto, it has been a rather disappointing tournament. I hope in all honesty that as far as Fernando Torres is concerned, it will be the same tomorrow, and that we shall not have to relive the experience of 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">On economic policy, the Spanish Presidency set itself a truly ambitious programme: EU 2020, stricter equity capital requirements for banks, regulation of hedge funds and reform of European financial supervision. This was absolutely the correct approach in the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">I must say, however, on behalf of my group, that we are disappointed with the result. Not so much with the Presidency of the Council as such, but with the Member States. We all know how diplomatic Mr Barroso is. When he says that there has been progress but no breakthrough, then for him, this is plain talking.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true that an agreement could be reached on the capital requirements, yet not on the regulation of hedge funds. Here, negotiations hit the buffers because no common position can be arrived at in the Council, although here too, there must be bargaining. There are also problems in the Council when it comes to financial supervision. Do the Member States really believe that in a common market for financial services, supervision should best be organised at a national level? The crisis has shown that this approach has failed. The Council should not stand in the way of efficient European financial supervision. The taxpayer is unable and unwilling to rescue the banking system one more time.</p>
      <p sl="de">Much the same goes for the EU 2020 strategy. In the Council, they behave as if the Lisbon Strategy had not failed due to mistaken ideas. That is precisely the case, however. The open method of coordination broke down. Here, too, we need more European cooperation. A jobs and growth strategy aiming for success must be based on the Community method. The new strategy does not do this to a sufficient degree. This House has called for a different approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we in Europe do not wish to settle for loss of prosperity in the long term, then we must become more competitive. For this purpose, we need an efficient growth strategy with potential for success. For this purpose, we need regulation and a reorientation of the financial markets, which focuses more strongly again on financing of the real economy. For this purpose, we need effective crisis prevention and crisis management in the form of a European financial supervision authority worthy of the name, and a European currency fund.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, to this end, we also need Member States’ governments finally to put their budgets in order, and better coordination of our economic policy in Europe. This cannot be a race to the bottom, it must be a race to the top; we want more competitiveness in more Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">In foreign policy, more would surely have been achieved if Spain had recognised Kosovo. This weakened the position of the Council on this question from the very beginning. The US-EU summit and the meeting of the Union for the Mediterranean were cancelled.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one final comment I should like to make. My group has an extremely constructive approach to negotiations with Turkey, but to have opened a new chapter on the last day of the Presidency, almost as if it were a reward for Turkey’s abstention in the UN Security Council on sanctions against Iran, has attracted criticism even from supporters of Turkey. I believe that engagement with Turkey must be carried out differently, in a more differentiated and committed way, and in a better thought-out way, rather than rushing through decisions at the last minute.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I shall make no remarks about football. I know you are all too clever for that. I shall only say it is a pity that Ghana has been eliminated. We can all agree on that, can we not? Good.</p>
      <p sl="de">The attitude in this House to the statements made today – namely, that we are all satisfied – surprises me. We have indulged in empty rhetoric. Progress has been made, progress and further progress, and somehow I have the impression that apart from here, in this Chamber, no one has noticed. You might say that this is something to do with our inability at this time to communicate well enough, but that is not the problem. Plainly and simply, the problem is that we must face reality for once. The reality is this: we are making resolutions about 2020, but we are incapable of making a single penny available for the seven or eight flagship projects. That will not work. I can already see the Council saying that we must reduce the European budget because of the crisis. That means you can already mothball 2020.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are always saying we want growth, growth, growth. Yes, but what sort of growth? Those who want growth cannot only get growth by saving. We need a European fund. Yes, but it must be a fund for solidarity and investment. Where today is Europe speaking about investment? Where? I have not heard it mentioned once in any of the speeches. Granted, you have perfected the Stability Pact, which means yet more sanctions that will not work unless you boost the economy. You can announce as many sanctions as you want, they will be of no avail. To achieve positive economic growth or, in other words, sustainable growth and green growth, you must also invest in certain sectors. I have heard nothing about that today – not a word.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to reiterate something with regard to SWIFT. Mr Schulz, this House has decided on a single paragraph on SWIFT. When the Americans make a request, there must be a judicial authority to monitor whether or not the request is legitimate. Now comes the agreement that you approve of, and the answer is Europol. I did not know that Europol was a judicial institution – one learns something new every day. An American police officer asks a European police officer whether something is alright, and you believe that a European police officer will say to an American police officer that it is not? That is nonsense, since the police have to work with each other. One force cannot monitor the other. No legal system makes provision for one police force to monitor another police force. SWIFT as it stands does not therefore meet the demands of the European Parliament, as we have voted on here. You, too, should say something about that, and not just praise it to the skies, since that is simply not the truth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, on the basis of your experience of the rotating Presidency, I believe that there is an institutional problem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that after six months … well, we will have to see after the next few Presidencies. I do not believe that the rotating Presidency and the permanent Presidency can function as Lisbon has defined the institutions. There is a real problem of dysfunctionality. We should have the clarity of mind to discuss this problem in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this Presidency took office at a critical time with much at stake. As the first rotating Presidency which would also chair the European Council and the General Affairs Council, it could have given shape to a new kind of Presidency, developing constructive relationships with the President and the High Representative. In the ongoing work of the Council and the preparations for the European Council, it could have had a vital role to play in driving forward a modern and progressive European reform agenda, and in facing the crises in the economy and public debt and in the eurozone, the European Union was owed a positive force for action.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead, sadly, too often, this Presidency has appeared more interested in sound bites than substance. It proposed a transatlantic summit which it could not deliver, while simultaneously pursuing a policy on Cuba which has destabilised the Atlantic relationship and contributes nothing to liberating the imprisoned people of that important island. It had sought a summit of the Mediterranean Union, but this was cancelled.</p>
      <p sl="en">In foreign policy, it seems their only consistent objective has been to try to undermine the High Representative by criticising her, for example, for not attending meetings and yet, to be frank, given the Presidency record in arranging summits, I can quite understand her reluctance in putting their meetings into her diary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the economy, the Spanish Presidency has been virtually invisible. Making the banks’ stress tests public is clearly a significant step, but let us not pretend that it amounts to a complete strategy for recovery. It is hard not to avoid the impression that the main objective of the Presidency during the eurozone crisis has been to hide away, but with a budget deficit of over 11%, perhaps they felt good reason to avoid international scrutiny. With a large deficit and a timid reform plan for their own economy at home, they were in no position to offer Europe leadership or to set an example, and so the historic opportunity from being the first Presidency following the Lisbon Treaty has been lost.</p>
      <p sl="en">Spain is a key member of the European Union, with its proud heritage and vibrant modern democracy. It has so much to offer, and in this House we have many distinguished Spanish representatives. Yet this uninspired, lacklustre Presidency has let down the Council, has let down the European Union and, I very much regret to say, has let down Spain as well.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, Mr Barroso, look, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, if there is no change to the underlying economic orientation of the Union, whoever holds the rotating Presidency is destined to dismantle the European social model. That is the plain truth. That is the reason for the general strikes in Greece, Italy, France, Portugal, and the next one, on 29 September, in Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">These general strikes are responses by workers and pensioners to this economic orientation agreed by you and by a substantial majority of this Chamber. There is great consensus. Just look at the differences that there are in the national debates, yet, when you come here, everyone is in agreement. That is because here, you are all in agreement on the basic orientation of an economic policy that penalises workers and pensioners, who are not the ones responsible for the crisis. They are not responsible, and yet they are going to pay for the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">For that reason, Mr President, I believe that the fundamental question is whether we have sufficient strength to change this economic orientation, which threatens the social model and social and territorial cohesion. At the end of the 1980s, the Washington Consensus moved to Brussels. There should be no intervention in the economy, all strategic services held in public hands should be privatised and steps should be taken towards deregulating the market. This policy of not intervening in the economy has led us into an unprecedented crisis within the European Union, and has placed the European social model in jeopardy. Therefore, it is impossible for a President-in-Office to save the situation without changing this model, which has made the Brussels consensus a photocopy of the failed Washington Consensus. It is a photocopy, Mr President.</p>
      <p sl="es">You began with the resounding failure that is the Lisbon Strategy. That was not part of your remit, and yet, despite that resounding failure – which aimed for 3% growth, to achieve 20 million jobs and to earmark 3% of GDP for research and development – another strategy is being introduced on the same basis of not intervening in the economy and not having public instruments, a European Treasury, a European fiscal policy, active employment policies or industrial employment policies. We do not have a single instrument, and we continue in our commitment to this failed policy. Logically, therefore, the response of the European workers’ movement cannot be otherwise. This the movement that has tried so hard to maintain the social model, and so its response is general strikes. General strikes.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, Mr President, we do not agree with the result of this Presidency, and I say to you, as I said at the beginning, that if there is no change in economic policy, whoever holds the rotating Presidency is destined to be the instrument that dismantles the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, with regard to foreign policy, we do not agree with the application of the European doctrine as a neighbourhood policy to countries that do not comply with clause 2 of the association agreements.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to address Mr Zapatero. You have exercised the EU rotating Presidency in the same way you govern your country, Spain – that is, with your back to your citizens. Today, I am coming back here to remind you of the infamous Spanish land-grab, a matter which I first brought to your attention in January. You have done nothing to resolve the madness affecting hundreds of thousands of people across Spain who face confiscation and demolition of their houses.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few days ago, the head of the planning inspectorate in Andalusia acknowledged that in that region alone, 300 000 houses are affected. This is not the handful of British citizens that some want us to believe. The suggested solution is that the owners can have their houses legalised for a fee. They have already paid, Mr Zapatero. My constituents regularly ask who is running Spain. Mr Westerdale writes that he fears he is facing a situation similar to that experienced by British subjects at the hands of President Mugabe in Zimbabwe and wonders why he is receiving this treatment in a friendly European country. This is why he feels that the European Union is not capable of protecting British citizens.</p>
      <p sl="es">Do you realise, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, that this ongoing situation is a violation of human rights, as well as being a major component of the crisis that Spain is going through? Do you expect the European Union to come to the rescue of a country where this violation continues to occur, without the central government deciding to intervene?</p>
      <p sl="es">For my part, you can be sure I will continue to fight in defence of all the people – the British, the Spanish and all Europeans – who are suffering this injustice.</p>

    <intervention id="2-023" speaker_id="97170" name="Francisco Sosa Wagner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, you made an error in your approach. You thought that you were actually going to preside over Europe and have an influence on the gear-wheels that make the complex European machinery work. You came to believe this because that is what you let people around you announce, that the world was going to experience a stellar moment under your Presidency. None of this has come to pass.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us move on to some details. With regard to these six months of Spanish Presidency, I would like to make a distinction between its political management on the one hand, and the work that has been carried out by the workers in the engine rooms, on the other. It is the first of these that has failed, and that is due to a lack of adequate impetus from the Presidency of the Government, which has fashioned a European Presidency in accordance with the swing of the pendulum. However, I would like to highlight the efforts made by the workers and their estimable desire to serve Europe and Spain. It is a fact, Mr President, that Spain has magnificent professional staff, and it is to be regretted that they are marginalised to such an extent in day-to-day reality.</p>
      <p sl="es">That said, it must be acknowledged that several praiseworthy initiatives have been adopted during these six months. Of these, I am pleased to mention the organ donation and transplantation plan, and the work carried out on the rights of patients with regard to cross-border healthcare.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreements on the new Europe 2020 strategy and, in particular, those relating to the European External Action Service, which are both still too fragile, are more up in the air.</p>
      <p sl="es">What occurred with the European protection order for victims of violence against women was regrettable, and the basic Community patent yielded the same sombre result for the livelihoods of thousands of companies, blocked, in part, by the linguistic problems engendered by Spanish legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">However it is the large-scale political gestures that have provided a closing balance of spectacular failure: from the Mediterranean summit to the one between the European Union and the United States, with your own government being responsible for creating excessive expectations with regard to the latter meeting. However, we would have to agree that not being able to move forward with your policy with regard to Cuba has been highly positive for the Cubans.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the advances made on the road towards better European economic governance cannot be attributed in any way to your Presidency, which was resoundingly absent on all of the most important questions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Goodbye, then, to the Spanish Presidency. I would like to draw one positive conclusion from this experience: my imagination as a convinced pro-European is excited when I think that this could mean the end of rotating presidencies as they have been conceived of to date. This would be good news, as until Europe strengthens its common institutions by solidly uniting their fragments, it will continue to run the risk of finding itself suffocating in the vacuum of irrelevance.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, these first six months following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon required and merited a change in political attitude.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the economic and financial crisis has been a consequence of the move away from the ‘real’ economy and the disordered development of the ‘unreal’ economy, the same can be said in a political context.</p>
      <p sl="es">On 20 January, in this Parliament, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero announced the four – not two – priorities of his Presidency: first, the common market for energy; second, investment in the information society; third, a sustainable economy or industry, with a plan for developing an electric vehicle; fourth, the completion of the Bologna higher education area. I ask myself, to what extent does this statement of objectives approach the reality that we have lived through?</p>
      <p sl="es">During his first speech, when he put forward his objectives, he did not mention the words ‘deficit’ or ‘debt’ once. The entire Presidency changed radically at the Ecofin meeting on 9 and 10 May of this year, and the euro crisis came to light.</p>
      <p sl="es">He continued to be late and unsuccessful. Necessary measures had to be improvised in the European Union due to the lack of foresight and depth in the diagnosis of the crisis. There was an additional difficulty: because of the results of his economic policy, the person holding the rotating Presidency was not in a position to participate in the leadership required for a solution, as he had become part of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="es">While rotating presidencies are, without a doubt, different following the treaty, in such an acute situation of economic crisis, either they assert themselves, or else they are even more limited and weighed down by the lack of confidence in, and the lack of credibility of, their economic policies within their respective countries, as in this case.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the greatest crisis that we politicians are living through is that of confidence. A crisis of confidence of such magnitude can only be resolved if we dare to tell the truth.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can find a description of the third fiction of this Presidency within this morning’s speech, in which it seemed that the President was only interested in extolling this Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="es">The question that we must ask ourselves is whether we will be capable of not going back to improvising or, instead, whether we will be able to diagnose and foresee the specific crisis scenario that will have a social dimension.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, over 25 years, Spain has held the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union four times, and, as on the last three occasions, it did so this time with intensely pro-European dedication and responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, it did so with results. It has never held the Presidency in such a difficult context as now, surely the most difficult that the European Union has known in its entire history. In this context of crisis, the results described in President Rodríguez Zapatero’s statement are doubly remarkable, as the crisis is not just economic. It has also been political. It has affected the bond of confidence linking the public in the Member States with the European project and Europe’s institutions. In successive elections, many citizens have stayed away from the ballot boxes, asking themselves who is in charge in this crisis: the financial markets, which are not answerable to anybody, or the governments, which are democratically answerable to their citizens?</p>
      <p sl="es">For all this, the economic and political governance of the European Union has moved forwards during these six months, which started with the delay in getting Lisbon up and running, and this is encouraging. Now, in keeping with the trio dynamic established in the Treaty of Lisbon, the pro-European impetus of this Presidency is being transferred to the subsequent presidencies: Belgium and Hungary. As everyone must be aware, none of the challenges of globalisation – demographic, energy-related, social and the fight against poverty – can be overcome by a single country on its own. We must row together, otherwise the European Union may slide towards irrelevance.</p>
      <p sl="es">The lesson from this is clear. It has shown us our vulnerability: that of the single currency in the face of a lack of fiscal, budgetary and economic coordination; that of response times in the face of the enormity and speed of the challenges. Hence, we have the motto of the European Union: united in diversity. In no case should we be disunited in the face of adversity. From now on, every Presidency must think globally, not locally. Moreover, every Presidency, over and above legitimate national interests, must act ‘in a European manner’, responding from Europe and for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="es">In addition to prestige, leading these projects requires authority and recognition. In this context, you have been constrained and limited by the appalling data from Spain and the constant rumours about its solvency and the deficit in its public accounts. In addition, improvisation and the haste to sell an image have adversely affected the progress of good ideas, such as the European protection order. One may also ask whether the rotating presidencies are helping to strengthen real European leadership.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the Basque Country, we would include the entire ‘Y Vasca’ line on the list of rail routes. There has been no progress in the recognition of Basque as a minority language in Europe, nor on the Basque economic agreement, nor on integrating the Ertzaintza, the Basque police, into the Schengen System. Spain and France have led the anchovy plan, which has been so important for the sector, when it was agreed with them and by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Treaty of Lisbon has not progressed, as you announced, with regard to its regional aspects and the annexes on subsidiarity and proportionality. Again, there has not been much respect for this Parliament at the end. You did not invite us to the start of the Spanish Presidency, and you summed up in the Congress before here.

      <p sl="es">We did not expect results – after all, it is not your fault in particular, but that of the system – but we did expect leadership. You demonstrated that, for example – and here I congratulate you – by promoting the European protection order. However, it would also have been good to see this leadership in other areas: for example, in promoting financial supervision on a European scale, committing to fiscal reform on a European scale, or really committing to a tax on financial transactions. On environmental issues, you continue to avoid acknowledging the importance of energy efficiency, you continue to subsidise coal and you are still not facing up to the destruction of coastlines.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it seems to me that it is very difficult to evaluate a Presidency which set itself very ambitious objectives. Perhaps one of the problems of this Presidency was those ambitious objectives, and alongside this there was the fact that the Presidency came at the time when the Union’s institutional system was changed by the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. Among the positive aspects of the Presidency, I would include the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy was, after all, prepared and adopted, although there does also exist the fear that it will, in the future, share the fate of the Lisbon Strategy – but the Spanish Presidency will not have any influence over this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, it is apparent that in external policy, Spain was not up to the task. The European Union-United States summit was not entirely successful, and also in matters which interest me – the Eastern Partnership – no progress was made at all. Even by taking advantage of the good offices of the new commissioner, Mr Füle, it did not prove possible, in my opinion, to move a single step forward in the matter of lifting or relaxing the visa regime for Ukraine, which could have been a kind of starting point, the start of something specific in the area of the Eastern Partnership. Of course, Mrs Ashton should have been doing something in this area, but this, too, was lacking. We cannot accept a situation in which the European Union’s objectives depend on which country currently holds the Presidency. If it is a Presidency from a Member State in the south, it works on objectives related to the south, and if it is from the east, it works on different objectives.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Spanish Presidency has left no enduring traces, Mr Zapatero. We were left with the impression that it was half-hearted, in large part lacking initiative and altogether unsuccessful, despite the best efforts of individuals. We do indeed recognise that there were enormous domestic problems to be tackled, whereby the government may have shared the blame for these. However, instead of restoring stability to Europe and leading it during the financial crisis, Spain added fuel to the fire. In football speak, one would have to say that it was an own goal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I shall mention just a few points. You said that we have remained true to the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Lisbon. I would query this. The rescue package contravenes the treaties and the budgetary rights of Parliament under Article 352. Not even the President of this House was involved. We have no agreement on supervision or regulation of the financial markets; rather, we are now working on it with the Belgian Presidency. We have no concrete progress on the Stability and Growth Pact. These are the facts.

      <p sl="es">Your Presidency has coincided with the Spanish economic collapse, which you were warned about. I myself reminded you in January of the dire predictions of the European Commission, which have come to pass through your inaction: an increase in unemployment, an uncontrolled public deficit and a fall in bank credit to companies. As a result, today, the international financial markets remain closed to a great many Spanish companies.</p>

Indeed, it is the Spain of Del Bosque, Casillas and Villa which has been fantastic this year and not the Spanish Presidency of the Union, which has, for too long, appeared completely remote and disinterested in the fate of a continent in crisis.</p>

Unfortunately, the trust which we initially placed in the Spanish Presidency has not been repaid at all.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Zapatero, I am doing nothing more than voicing the thoughts of many Members, including some who are politically close to you. We think that, just as in the Barcelona Process, you have resorted to empty nominalism, where announcing results is the same as having achieved them.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reason behind this position originates from a radical political stance which has not cast off your heavy ideological footprint, even during a period of serious crisis. In these six months, we needed pragmatism and the desire to draw fully upon the founding values of the European Union. In many speeches, you have preferred to refer to utopias which no longer bear any relation to reality and resign yourself to an anaemic six months, despite the substantial help received from Parliament on, for example, the issue of the European External Action Service.</p>

We are grateful that this Presidency has succeeded in removing the discharge procedure for the Council from the sphere of obscurity. Previously, the Council has refused to lay adequate accounts before the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sessions had, at best, an informal character. One had to collect documents bit by bit, or they were unavailable. Answers to questions were unsatisfactory.

      <p sl="de">This has now changed. The Secretary-General of the Council has agreed to introduce a discharge procedure worthy of the name in a transparent procedure in compliance with democratic standards.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, I would have liked to have made a different speech today, believe me. You set out six months full of ambition, and set the bar so high with your claims that, when these are compared with what was actually achieved, disappointment was inevitable. What is certain is that you have not been able to overcome a complex situation for which you lacked leadership and credibility.</p>
      <p sl="es">You yourself pointed out once that the European Union is a club with rules and I agree. However, it was up to you to demand obedience to these rules. The reality is that it was the government of Spain that urgently needed to fulfil its obligations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Within this context, positive achievements, whilst not lacking, have been undistinguished. Unlike me, you have had time to talk about them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Democracy is a public opinion-based system. This is how it seems: President Obama’s disdain, as well as the cancellation of the Mediterranean Summit and the one announced between the European Union and the United States, constitute very significant failures.</p>
      <p sl="es">The rush to reach improvised agreements at any cost has not helped the image of Spanish management: as a way of achieving a respectable objective, it could be described as amateurish.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain is a great nation, and will continue to be one, despite the poor management of this period. Our diplomats and officials have kept a stiff upper lip and, thanks to this, Spain’s prestige will survive.</p>
      <p sl="es">The truth is that the situation in Spain will count for more within the value judgment that will be made of this Presidency than what was done or not done here. Someone who has taken his country into a phase of uncertainty and unrest would have difficulty in providing leadership for an enterprise this difficult.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Spanish Presidency delivered what was expected concerning the most important institutional issues. We did not agree on everything but we began to fill the Lisbon framework with life and concrete details. Next to these seemingly technical issues, the presidential programme of our Spanish friends did not lack policy ambitions. They established themselves as models for working towards gender equality and the promotion of women’s rights. Huge thanks go to this Presidency, especially to Mr López Garrido and his team, for making this often neglected issue a core one during the last six months. We have not yet managed to finalise the European Protection Order but I am hopeful that we will do so under the Belgian Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Zapatero, evaluation of the Spanish Presidency is of particular importance to us because it is the first Presidency under the new Treaty of Lisbon, and this is important for us, for example the Poles, because we are preparing for the Polish Presidency. I would like to ask if the state of affairs which has actually been achieved strengthens future presidencies or not.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have to say that, during the Presidency, what we had expected turned out to be the case – the Treaty of Lisbon, which was intended to support a strong Europe, in fact, leads to a weakening of the Community method. Unfortunately, during the Spanish Presidency, this was very clear, the best example being the weakening of Parliament’s role in building the 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Spanish Presidency was involved in interesting work, including the very interesting meeting in Toledo on the role of cities, and this deserves to be recognised. However, for us MEPs from other Member States, it is very important to watch what is happening in Spain, too, because the Presidency is not only about leadership, but is also about leadership of the whole European Union. In relation to this, it is very important to us what the economic situation is like in Spain, including during the Presidency, as well as the arguments which are put forward. It is also important to us what model of social and civil affairs is being promoted by Spain, as well as how it defends the provisions of the treaty – which says that family matters are the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Member States. This is something which causes us very great concern.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Spanish Presidency has coincided with a deep financial and credibility crisis in the Union. This crisis has hit the country holding the Presidency very hard. The deficit of trust in the EU economy and common currency is rooted in the huge debt burden, which is still looming large in the way of life: living today at the cost of tomorrow. Last week’s Economist asked: ‘Is there life after debt?’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Prime Minister referred to enhancing competitiveness as one of the main goals of the Presidency, but no real recipe has been offered as regards how to address the crisis of values, the moral crisis, and even how it would be practically possible to return to a balanced budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">On several occasions, we have missed the Council at Question Time in Strasbourg. Numerous MEPs are still waiting for the opportunity to put a question to the Council on how the new ESDP could be applied to arms sales to third countries and whether we could finally agree to have consultations in the Council before deciding to sell modern military technology to partners outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I am concerned that cyber threats have not been high on the Spanish agenda. Cyber weapons are being developed secretly and we have no idea of how and when they could be used. The EU needs to take the lead in the debate on how to reduce the threat of cyber war, how to restrict cyber attacks before it is too late, and establishing whether there is any chance of agreeing on any rules on good behaviour in cyberspace.</p>

We saw an abject capitulation to the sharks in the financial markets, whereby predatory banks and hedge fund pirates were allowed to exercise more control over economic policy than supposedly solid governments. President Barroso and the EU Commission acted as the enforcer for these sharks in the markets, demanding cuts across the board in public spending and in services, and you too, Señor Zapatero, acted as an enforcer for the speculators in the markets. Instead of fighting them, as a real socialist party would do, you imposed savage cuts on the living standards of the Spanish people at their behest. We now have a social nightmare of mass unemployment and a tax on living standards across Europe. I salute the workers of Spain for fighting these cuts with strong strike action. Clearly, the capitalist system only contains more and more disasters as it goes into deeper crisis. We have to sweep it away and replace it with a socialist and democratic society that can really transform the lives of our people in Europe.</p>

This was the first time a Presidency had operated after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which redefined and reassigned its competences. Against a background of political, economic and financial failures, adapting the role of the Presidency to work with the newly appointed President of the Council did not develop into a major problem.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It did not prove possible to go ahead with the planned European Union-United States summit, because President Obama refused to attend, or something which was important to Spain – the project for a Union of Mediterranean states. When the Union was faced with an enormous economic crisis, Germany and France took over at the helm, setting the tone of the financial aid programme for Greece. The spectre of financial collapse also hung over Spain itself. So it is hardly surprising that it was the involvement of other countries which came to the forefront in this Presidency. Greater consideration was given to the future of the euro area than to the priorities of the Spanish Presidency. These problems will now have to be taken on, too, by the Belgian Presidency.</p>

Instead of seizing the bull by the horns in the traditional Spanish manner and pushing through the necessary new regulation of the financial markets and the rating agencies quickly and courageously, the Spanish Presidency took refuge in attempts at appeasement, and postponed weighty projects to be dealt with by the next Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Spanish Presidency was announced at the start of the year as a landmark in history. In fact, six months were pointlessly wasted, and the wrong turning of centralism enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon blindly followed further. Since Spain is well known to have massive financial problems itself, it was, among other things, overwhelmed by management of the financial crisis. Under Spanish leadership, the political meaninglessness of the EU has again been brought to the notice of the world. Important meetings have fallen through, and it was only possible to agree on stop-gap measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, the Presidency was unique. Never before have the EU treaties been so massively broken as by the rescue packages costing millions, which will soon come tumbling down on our heads, as they have merely postponed dealing with the EU’s real problems.</p>

However, this is not the main reason why the Spanish Presidency cannot be evaluated positively.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Its main fault was chaos, which was prophetically foretold by the face of Mr Bean placed by a hacker on the Spanish website. The chaos showed itself in the fact that, on the one hand, Madrid brought about tremendous disorder in the Union’s external actions, encroaching on the competences of the High Representative, while on the other, it did not put any active measures in place in response to the worsening budgetary crisis. Mr Zapatero was unable to sense the mood in the Union when the need was for a strong leader, not on the international scene, but within the Union. The Union’s main problem was not policy towards Cuba, an arms embargo on China or the peace process in the Middle East, but a weakening of Europe as a result of the budgetary problems of Greece, Italy, Portugal and of Spain itself.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for the interest that you have shown in the Spanish Presidency of the European Union. This interest seemed to me to be more in line with a desire to be in or speak in the Spanish Parliament rather than the European Parliament during some speeches, which I will not be able to refer to individually given the time limitations. In truth, it may be that some people are nostalgic for that place, and I understand that perfectly well. They have my respect and my esteem, but the current situation is what is important at the moment, and we are in the European Parliament judging other matters, and not in the Spanish Parliament.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">There was another speaker who also seemed to me to have this tendency to feel like he shared the responsibilities of colleagues in the Spanish Parliament, or to be intent on getting involved with what they are doing; of lending his political and ideological colleagues a hand. However, in my opinion, we have other things to do here. We are here to judge and assess the main themes of the Presidency and its six-month tenure. It is true that you have been able to ask individual questions, but I will not be able to refer to all of them. During my initial speech, I wanted to adopt two perspectives that I believe should be the common theme of a considered, calm and objective analysis of these six months.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, it was the first rotating Presidency that had to deal with the application of a new treaty that, more than anything, is a treaty that changes institutional rules and our form of government into a Union of 27, with well known institutional complexity. To my mind, as a European and pro-European government, the first obligation that I took into consideration during these six months was that there should not be a single complaint, a single failure, a single institutional hitch and that, from day one, the new institutions would enjoy all of the political and functional legitimacy required to carry out their role. This would also make it easier for the relationship between the institutions – such as the Commission – which are, shall we say, already consolidated, and the new institutional framework, to work sufficiently well.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can say with satisfaction that the Spanish Presidency has received nothing but support and recognition for its constructive attitude from the Commission, from the Council and from the European Parliament, and I am glad that not a single criticism of the attitude towards the major institutions has been expressed today. This was our first great challenge within the European Union as we have built it. I have to say with all humility – the same humility with which I would say to Mr Schulz, who is not here at the moment because he has had to go to a meeting on the approach to be taken to dialogue relating to financial supervision, for which he apologises, that we are, of course, hoping that tomorrow night, the result will be a victory for creativity, and that we Spaniards can have a day of celebration that I will share in full with all political representatives, as Mr Schulz will do with Chancellor Merkel if the case arises; at the end of the day, it will all remain in Europe, which is always satisfying – that Spain has played its part in ensuring that the Treaty of Lisbon works satisfactorily and has done so from day one, so that all of the institutions are comfortable in their roles and we can move forward towards a greater degree of union.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second main objective, Mr Mayor Oreja, was to move forward from day one of the Presidency in terms of economic union and common economic policy. The digital market, insofar as it has moved forward, and the electric vehicle plan, insofar as it has also moved forward, are no more than instruments for encouraging economic union, the same as the internal market. Let us, therefore, make a distinction between the main objectives and those that are instruments for ensuring that this economic union promotes greater competitiveness and combines the synergies of all Europeans within the areas of energy, industry, innovation, research, competitiveness, and also, hopefully, jobs and others.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now let us see what the result is. It may be that the objective, which is entirely legitimate, is not shared. However, if the objective was, as expressed by the Spanish Presidency, greater union in terms of economic policy, this has been achieved beyond expectations. Firstly, because we have financial supervision, I am hoping for an agreement that achieves the desired objectives, and regulation of all financial products; and secondly, we have a momentum for reform of the Stability Pact, for greater budgetary stringency and rigour, with new instruments for compliance with the Stability Pact. Incidentally, while we are talking so much about rules, I have to say that, since the inception of the euro, Spain has complied much more closely with the Stability Pact than many other countries among those that one of the Members of this House has mentioned.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">Let us, therefore, look at the facts. Yes, yes, let us look at the facts. Spain is the country that has complied most closely with the Stability Pact, and there are others that have broken it up to seven times: they have made use of certain expedients up to seven times. However, in the end, that is how things are. What is certain is that during these six months, we have made progress towards new rules within the Stability Pact, with more incentives, more penalties and more requirements. Let us move on to another consideration, and an analysis of the macro-economic situation of countries, including competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">Spain has put itself forward to the Commission for assessment, together with Finland, I believe, of its competitive potential and we will be moving forward with the Europe 2020 strategy, which was also approved during this period, with the intention of rectifying the fault that the Lisbon Strategy had: governance. This is because the national objectives will be much more exacting, because there will be monitoring, because there will be recommendations and because there will be, and should be, greater shared responsibility for each state and, of course, for the Commission in the fulfilment of the Europe 2020 strategy. All of this is the situation to date with regard to greater economic union, to which I would add – a consequence of events during the sovereign debt crisis – the financial stabilisation instruments adopted, or the commitments on support for Greece: commitments that Spain has, of course, supported and observed from the start, as we have done with regard to the support for Greece. From the start. We will fulfil each and every one of our commitments.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of this is fact, and some of you ladies and gentlemen here have put forward some rhetoric, some more, some less brilliant. However, if our intention was to achieve the satisfactory implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have done this. If we decided to move, together with the Commission, towards economic union that is much more solid, stronger and with more common economic policies, we have also done this. With regard to foreign policy, it is true that there was no summit with the United States, but there were two major agreements. It is also true that there were major agreements and summits with Latin America. It is also true that, with regard to the Union of the Mediterranean, prudence counselled that the summit should not take place, which does not mean that plans relating to the Union of the Mediterranean have been put on hold, and there will be a summit when it can contribute to peace in the Middle East. Therefore, with or without summits – with the United States, in this case – there were important agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course, although the Presidency wanted to lay down a marker from day one, it did not want to get into an argument over who has the leading role within the European institutions. What was important was that the Europe 2020 strategy was adopted, and it has been adopted; what was important was that a financial support mechanism for countries was adopted, and it has been adopted; what was important was that the financial supervision package was put in place, and so it has been; what was important was that SWIFT was adopted, and I hope that Parliament will adopt it; what was important was that the ‘euro-order’ was set in motion, and it has been set in motion; what was important was the cross-border agreement with regard to health, and this is in place. What is important is the tally of agreements. The Spanish Presidency, through its drive, or through the hard work of its officials, Spanish officials, contributed to all of these and this must be acknowledged in all cases, although there will be some who do not want to acknowledge the political aspects of this, that politicians should encourage and give credit to these officials.</p>
      <p sl="es">A point was made by one of the Members of this House about the situation of European – basically British – citizens in our country as regards property, particularly on the coast. I have to say that I, as President of the government of Spain, cannot agree with the comparison that a representative of a certain political grouping from Great Britain made, or tried to make, here, actually mentioning Zimbabwe. I cannot agree with this in any way: it is unacceptable so I do not accept it. I reject it utterly. My country is under the rule of law.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="es">My country is under the rule of law, it obeys laws and it ensures that they are obeyed, and it is the courts that have to apply these laws. We would be the first to sympathise with people, in this case British citizens, who may have been the victims of a swindle by some property sector shark and we are working on this with the European Parliament and with the parliamentary groups. We will work and do whatever is in our power. Furthermore, the European Parliament has demanded, on more than one occasion, that Spain protect its coastline and its environment and we have a law for coastal areas designed to protect them from the property crisis: we must apply it. We must also, from this great institution that is the European Parliament, advocate protection of the coastline and the combating of abuses that can affect natural areas, environmental areas and the coastline that we are so determined to defend.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank the group presidents and, in particular, Mr Daul and Mr Schulz, for their measured tone during this sitting. The Spanish Presidency has faced up to its commitments with European and pro-European willingness, it has faced up to its commitments with an attitude of loyalty and cooperation with regard to the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, and it has faced up to its period of working with economic and foreign activity objectives, which it has fulfilled satisfactorily, by and large. Clearly not in all cases and with regard to all of the points that we had proposed, but if we look again – and I am speaking most directly to listeners from my own country – at what the Spanish Parliament passed, we can see that it was achieved in a satisfactory manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, I would like, as rotating President of the Council, to express my profound gratitude to the European Parliament and, in particular, to the President of the European Parliament, for all of the cooperation we have received during this six-month period. We have felt supported by you, Mr President. We have felt understood by you, encouraged by you. We have felt close to this institution, although, at times, there have been harsh voices. Nonetheless, we have felt close to the European Parliament and we are cheered that it is on the side of those of us who truly have a pro-European vocation, who serve Europe loyally, and who are convinced that there is no better destiny than to journey together, united, and, sometimes, leave the lesser disputes for another time.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I will be very brief. The questions were essentially directed at the Prime Minister of Spain, but I would just like to take this opportunity to reflect on a point of concern expressed by various honourable Members. I am thinking of my fellow Members, Mr Daul, Mr Schulz, and Mr Lambsdorff. It is an institutional issue and, once again, I would like to thank the Prime Minister of Spain, Mr Zapatero, for his commitment to Europe and to the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I think it is right to highlight that a lot depended on this first rotating Presidency. How would the rotating Presidency interpret the Treaty of Lisbon? The truth is that, as the Prime Minister of Spain said, it was interpreted in a communitarian sense.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would like our system, which is a very complex system and continues to be complex with the Treaty of Lisbon, to function more efficiently. I think that there will come a time when we must rigorously shake up the development of our institutions, because the truth is that, even with the Treaty of Lisbon, it is sometimes difficult for the average citizen to clearly interpret the workings of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I should like to stress, as was said earlier, that Spain has brought this European impulse to the structure of our joint project – an impetus which I also know is shared by the great majority in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon has always stood for more Europe, not less Europe. The Treaty of Lisbon continues the sense of Community by strengthening the powers of this Parliament, by creating a permanent Presidency of the European Council, by creating the figure of the High Representative, who is also the Vice-President of the European Commission, and by increasing the powers of the Commission in external issues or, for example, in the Stability and Growth Pact’s mechanisms of taxation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon stands for more Europe, not less Europe. However, this does not mean Europe in the sense of centralised powers, but in the sense of increased value, of what we can jointly attain: Member States/European institutions. And the Spanish Presidency’s interpretation favoured more Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However as the Spanish Prime Minister said very well, the treaty does not resolve every problem. It is essential for the 27 governments to carry out the political will of the treaty because, by their own inclination, the European institutions are, in reality, instinctively communitarian. We also have to ask our Member States, our 27 Member States, to apply the Treaty of Lisbon in this Community spirit.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Spain has set an example. I am sure that Belgium, once it assumes the rotating Presidency of the Council, will continue to take the same approach, or even step up this approach, knowing, as we do, Belgium’s great European tradition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, it is essential that Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the European Council are truly committed to the European implementation of a treaty which will allow us to respond more efficiently to our fellow citizens’ expectations and anxieties. Therefore, I would like to, once again, thank the Spanish Government, its Prime Minister, all of its associates and the whole Spanish team, who have worked with such commitment during these past months; at times, it was extremely difficult.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The truth is that these were the most difficult months in the history of European integration, during which it was put to the test. The real stress test is not on the banks, but on the European Union and our willingness to be united in the euro area and in Europe. It was in this extremely difficult context, when a new treaty came into force, that Spain assumed the rotating Presidency with the Commission, which took office in February. This Commission is less than five months old. We have also done everything possible to recover from the delays caused by this transition, and the truth is we must acknowledge, earnestly and honestly, the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, without prejudice, obviously, to the plurality of political viewpoints which exist within this Parliament, I should like to emphasise that all of us who believe in Europe must be united, whether from the centre, the left or the right, as must the different institutions. We must be united in order to strengthen our European project.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I note the work done by the Spanish Presidency, taking into account the particularly difficult circumstances which marked the first half of this year. Firstly, the Spanish Presidency’s mandate coincided with a period of transition to a new institutional structure as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon’s entry into force. There are now new actors such as the President of the Council and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. In this new institutional context, I would also like to highlight the enhancement of Parliament’s competences and powers. Secondly, this Presidency has been faced with a period of severe financial and social crisis in Europe. It has faced the attack on the euro and the Greek crisis, and it has struggled with an alarming increase in unemployment and the deficit in its own country. It has contributed to the creation of a financial stabilisation mechanism to the value of EUR 75 billion and to improving the regulation of financial markets. At the same time, the Spanish Presidency never lost sight of the implementation of Europe’s priorities for policy, particularly in relation to the environment. Given this, I would like to highlight the Spanish Presidency’s cooperation in preparing and discussing my report on bio-wastes, which it unconditionally supported and which was adopted by an overwhelming majority this week in this Chamber.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Regrettably, the Spanish Presidency did not seek answers to the serious problems that the European Union is experiencing. Furthermore, during this time, unacceptable measures were taken which demonstrate a lack of solidarity. Moreover, what they did in relation to the sovereign debt is very serious.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In fact, the Presidency awaited Germany’s decisions and allowed the problem to drag on, with serious consequences for Greece and Portugal, and for Spain itself. This also proves who holds power in the European Union after all. The list of the greatest powers is becoming increasingly limited to Germany and, at best, France.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The slow solutions were subsequently of poor quality. Instead of encouraging solidarity among the richest countries, and increasing Community budgets for actions of solidarity to ensure real social and economic cohesion, the Spanish Presidency turned to the International Monetary Fund and lent money to Greece at a higher rate of interest than the European Central Bank levies upon private banks. To make matters worse, they imposed unacceptable conditions, which made the cost of the crisis, which the EU helped to create, fall upon the workers and the poorest members of society, merely to favour the profits of economic and financial groups. The approval of the Europe 2020 strategy will mean taking the same approach.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The recently completed Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, was, for at least several reasons, one of the most important of the last decade.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, Spain had to face the difficult task of ‘testing’ the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon. These changes were implemented efficiently, despite the fact that almost until the beginning of the Presidency, the government in Madrid did not know which treaty would be the basis for shaping the Union agenda.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, Spain had to face up to the greatest financial crisis in the history of the common currency, the euro. I would like to remind everyone who has a sceptical view of the recently completed Presidency that the Spanish Government was one of the first to properly estimate the scale of the crisis and demand introduction of effective countermeasures, including sanctions for exceeding the permissible budget deficit.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, the Spanish Presidency should be valued for its enormous contribution to work on the SWIFT negotiations and the form of the European External Action Service. Thanks to Madrid’s work, which, at first sight, was not very effective, agreement in both areas is now within arm’s reach. The results of the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union can most certainly be considered successful. Let us hope the Belgian Presidency which has just begun will maintain the current pace of work and take the road marked out by the government in Madrid.</p>

      <p sl="en">Recently, one of the Commission’s spokespersons publicly regretted the way the Romanian Parliament had amended the law on the functioning of the National Agency for Integrity. However, the Romanian Parliament was implementing a decision taken by the Constitutional Court, declaring unconstitutional some of the articles of the initial law. The fact that the Romanian Government – motivated by internal politics – has not reacted and that the Commission probably considers it tolerable to combat corruption in Romania using means that go beyond the law of the land does not make those remarks acceptable, because, in fact, they question the Constitution, the actions of the national parliament and the sovereignty of a Member State and are, therefore, a matter of principle and not of political opportunity! Besides, if the Romanians are ‘corrupt’, who was it who ‘corrupted’ them?</p>

      <p sl="pl">I congratulate the Spanish Presidency on the past six months of leadership of the Union. It was a difficult and a significant Presidency. Difficult, because it was the first after entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, with the appointment of the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The programme for the Presidency was prepared on the basis of the old treaty, because during the preparation stage, the fate of the Treaty of Lisbon was uncertain. The crisis in Greece slowed down realisation of the Presidency’s objectives. Another difficulty was the late approval, in February 2010, of the new composition of the European Commission and the resultant delay in adopting its legislative programme.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Presidency was significant: a) institutionally, because with adoption of the new treaty, it established certain principles of operation for the institutions and b) for the long term, because with adoption of the 2020 strategy, it established the directions of the Union’s work for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The achievements of Mr Zapatero’s socialist government which should be acknowledged as the most important are: a) adoption of the action plan for implementation of the provisions of the Stockholm Programme (cooperation on internal affairs and the justice system), b) the commitment of the Presidency to eliminating violence against women, c) adoption by the Council, on 3-4 June 2010, of the negotiating mandate on accession of the EU to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, d) the start of the work of the Standing Committee on Operational Cooperation on Internal Security and e) adoption of the draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the procedures and conditions required for a citizens’ initiative.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Union’s Spanish Presidency set as its objective the complete, rapid implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. This has created a new institutional equilibrium, granting increased powers to the European Parliament and national parliaments, and adding a European dimension to the respect for fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="ro">During the EU’s Spanish Presidency, important progress was made in areas such as implementing the Citizens’ Initiative, specialist opinions which need to be provided by national parliaments based on the additional protocols of the Treaty of Lisbon, new regulations governing the delegation of executive powers to the Commission, as well as the European External Action Service. We welcome the conclusion of the OpenSky Agreement between the US and EU, aimed at 60% of international passenger transport, along with the agreements for common regulations in the fields of civil aviation and air transport safety between the EU and Canada. I would also like to applaud the progress made on the cooperation agreement between the EU and Mercosur.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, during the Spanish Presidency, the European Union was also faced with an alarming rise in unemployment, against the background of the economic and financial crisis which started in 2008. For this reason, I believe that reducing unemployment and providing sustainable economic growth ought to remain the number one priority for the EU’s Belgian Presidency too.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Alexander Álvaro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data from the EU to the USA for the purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (11222/2010 - C7-0158/2010 - 2010/0178(NLE)) (A7-0224/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-062" speaker_id="28246" name="Alexander Alvaro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I am very grateful that the Commissioner can be here. I am sure that the Spanish Presidency’s need for discussion is about to come to an end. Where we had bulk data transfer in SWIFT, we now have a bulk gathering in Parliament. Well, let it be so.</p>
      <p sl="de">In February, we sent a very clear signal as Parliament that the Treaty of Lisbon not only gives us more opportunities, but also, and above all, more responsibility as the European Parliament. We govern with, and together with, the Commission and the Council at European level. The Commission has been requested to present us with an improved agreement and to enter into negotiations once again, and the mandate for these negotiations has been confirmed by the European Parliament. Given all the differences that might exist between the groups and, above all, the different points of emphasis, I believe it would not be honourable to deny that the Commission has made some genuine progress. That is something that we must give it a great deal of credit for, especially in the context of the arrangement within which it has been working and of the opportunities that were open to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, however, it emerged during the subsequent negotiations that the word ‘impossible’ was used a great deal. It was impossible to alter certain things, or to reopen the agreement. It was impossible to demand concessions from the United States, let alone for the European Parliament to have any influence over the Council. If I personally have learnt anything from this discussion, it is that the word ‘impossible’ does not exist in politics if the political will is there. For we have seen that the European Parliament was in a position, in collaboration with the Commission, to ensure that improvements were inserted into the text of the agreement. After the agreement was initialled, the Commissioner was able to agree with the United States that an important request – namely that European officials could be in situ in Washington to monitor extraction of data and in cases of abuse to prevent it should the occasion arise – should be included in the agreement, namely in Article 12(1).</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, an important issue for all groups was the transfer of bulk data to the United States. That is something that we have achieved in collaboration with the Council and, it must be admitted, using a certain amount of pressure – that in the medium term, we are in a position to resolve this problem. It will not be done overnight, but we have a clear concession from the Commission, enshrined in a Council document – in passing, I can say that we have never before been able to amend a Council document with our wording, so this is a unique occurrence – that after one year, the Commission must lay before us a technical and legal framework for the extraction of this data from European soil.</p>
      <p sl="de">After three years, we must also receive a progress report on how far this system has developed in the interim. There is a reference to Article 11 of the agreement in this inserted text, to wit that a progress report must follow within three years, and Article 11 of the agreement states that if the European Union works on a procedure itself, both parties – the US and the European Union – must amend the text of the agreement accordingly. This means that we have the possibility of revisiting this afresh, without surprising anyone or damaging mutual interests. We have managed to ensure that, in the event that this system does not exist after five years, there must be serious discussion and then negotiation, that the agreement must then be terminated according to Article 21(2), and that a new agreement must be drawn up on the basis of what then exists.</p>
      <p sl="de">I must, above all, reassure those who are concerned that their personal bank data, rental payments and miscellaneous remittances will be transferred to the United States. It is explicitly provided that no national data transfer is included in the transfer of data to the United States. Internal European bank data transfers will also largely not be conducted via SWIFT. These are instead SEPA data, which are explicitly excluded from the agreement. What remains, therefore, are data from the European Union to third countries, which are transferred to and evaluated in the United States, until we are in the position to do this ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, as I still have a little time left following this round of speakers, I should like to say that this process has taught us that the Commission, the Council and Parliament must pull together more closely, and, when it comes to coordination, cooperate even better. I believe that, with reference to the changes that the Treaty of Lisbon has set out, we have shown what form they can take, and that, together with the Commission and the Council, we have been aware of our responsibility to present a sensible solution.</p>
      <p sl="de">As has been said, not everyone in this House is pleased, but I would like expressly to thank my fellow Members, including those who will sit in opposition, for their willingness to propose key points. To fellow Members from the larger groups, who will be prepared to vote with us for this agreement on Thursday, my thanks also go to you for the cooperation and good shared work that we have enjoyed. As I have already said, my particular respect goes to those among my fellow Members who will be voting against, as they have played a most constructive role in this process. One can never attain 100%, however, when one has four negotiating partners.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start, of course, by congratulating the rapporteur on his hard work, and also Commissioner Malmström on her splendid and constructive work. In the context of the art of the handover, I should, of course, like to thank the Spanish Presidency verbally; Mr Zapatero was here a minute ago. I have the honour of being among the first members of the Belgian Presidency to be present in this House. We shall endeavour to exercise the rotating Presidency with verve and a great deal of Belgian persuasiveness. We are about to put the finishing touches to an issue on which the Swedish and Spanish Presidencies did the preparatory work.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Parliament has clearly played its part in this. It decided on 11 February 2010 to reject the interim agreement. The new agreement was approved on 28 June 2010. It is indeed proof of Europe’s decisiveness that we achieved a result in this way, in consultation between all the institutions. I shall not list all the many improvements – this has already been done – but instead just touch on three that are fundamental. One important aspect is the introduction of effective legal remedies so that everyone can see whether rectifications, erasure or blocking of data have been implemented. Article 18 is a good article. Article 12 represents a second improvement. I freely admit that supervision by independent monitoring authorities goes without saying, and that this change, which was requested by Parliament, is a constructive one. Therefore, taking into consideration also the clarifications and recommendations that have been added, the way in which day-to-day supervision of the extraction of SWIFT data is to be carried out constitutes a positive improvement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, I am very pleased that this is a European solution and that Europol is to play a part. This is a methodology we need to master. We need to further strengthen our own institutions. We need to have faith in them. Europol has experience with data-protection rules, and we must assume that this was a good choice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Also, it has to be said that the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP) has already produced some important results, and we must continue to defend the security of our citizens. The fight against terrorism is necessary, and we must ensure that it is carried out. One thousand five hundred dossiers have already been handed over in that way. Therefore, I believe that we should continue with this approach, as we, the Council, have entered into a commitment to take steps within Europe towards progress and towards developing our own system, a European system, rather than merely relying on our partners or falling back on the American system. The steps to be taken after one, three and possibly five years have been set out by the rapporteur, and have been incorporated into the draft Council decision.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In conclusion, therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we must offer maximum guarantees of the security of our citizens. We must shoulder our responsibility in that regard, and we must do so by striking a successful balance with data protection, whilst bearing in mind our commitment to building up our protective mechanisms. I thank you in advance for the support I hope you will give to this important step, this important intervention by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am really glad to be back in the plenary today on the occasion of this debate. I am especially happy that we have achieved, as the rapporteur and the President said, good cooperation between the three institutions for a text that I hope you will approve later this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has only been possible because of the close cooperation we have had: all the institutions, the rapporteur, the political group, the committee, and outside representatives of the group. I would like to thank all of you wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very satisfied that the agreement we signed on 28 June gives us a new base and a new start for EU-US cooperation. I am delighted that the structures and the procedures have worked well – not without difficulty, but they have worked well – and it has allowed us in record time to negotiate an agreement which ensures good high-level protection of personal data, whilst maintaining a counter-terrorist programme that helps to save lives in Europe and in the US and beyond.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement for which I ask your consent this week is considerably different from the interim agreement that you rejected in February. Let me just mention a few points.</p>
      <p sl="en">It empowers a European public authority, namely Europol, to verify that each and every request is tailored as narrowly as possible in order to minimise the amount of data requested.</p>
      <p sl="en">It takes account of Parliament’s call for a twin-track approach, holding out the prospect of an EU mechanism in the medium term allowing for extraction of data on European soil and for a more targeted transfer of data.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur laid out the provisions that we will take. Immediately after the vote, I will begin a study to consider the possible introduction of a European system. This system will be the basis for a full impact assessment taking into account the legal, technical, economic and other aspects of a future European TFTP mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">The agreement also includes significant data protection when it comes to transparency, rights of access, rectification, erasure and redress. It allows the Commission to appoint a person who will monitor the day-to-day extraction of data from the TFTP database and who will be empowered to query and even block searches. This person will be on the premises where the US analysts are working and will have full access to the TFTP searches to ensure permanent monitoring. This is a major achievement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, the agreement empowers the EU to undertake regular and detailed reviews of the TFTP. The first such review will take place six months after the entry into force of the agreement. The review team will include data protection experts and an expert with a judicial background and they will be able to do random checks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of these changes are the direct results of discussions that I have had with the European Parliament rapporteurs – both of them, and I would like to thank them both – and other key members of the political groups. This is indeed an achievement of Europe: the Council, Parliament and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another important point here, which the President referred to, is that the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme will help to make our lives safer. Member States have confirmed the enormous value of this information derived from the TFTP which the US authorities share with us.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also know that since the start of this year, leads on known suspects have gone cold because EU-stored TFTP data have not been transferred to the US for the last six months. This has been a serious situation and I am relieved that we are now closing this security gap.</p>
      <p sl="en">The London bombings took place exactly five years ago. This sad anniversary makes us remember the victims and their families and we wish that this tragedy had never happened and that it will never happen again. We must do our best to prevent future attacks and this agreement is one important tool in the fight to prevent horrible attacks like this one.</p>
      <p sl="en">For all these reasons, I would ask you to give your consent to the agreement on Thursday. I am confident that most of you will share the opinion of the rapporteur and acknowledge the many important improvements that have been made in this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the context of our group’s rejection of the interim TFTP Agreement, we welcome the decision by the Spanish Presidency and the US to reopen negotiations to take on board key data protection safeguards for all EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, our group can support the Alvaro report, not because it represents the perfect agreement, but because it contains the key protections we would all expect to see in an international data sharing deal of this importance – as Mr Strasser said, in this milestone event. It signals the Parliament’s ability, post-Lisbon, to represent the interests of all EU citizens in its dealings with the Council, Commission and third countries. It is a new start, as Mrs Malmström said.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the central point, the transfer of bulk data of EU citizens, we have successfully brokered the so-called twin-track approach, combining strict safeguards, such as the EU appointment of EU staff in the US Treasury, with a concrete timetable leading the way to a European solution for the extraction of data on EU soil.</p>
      <p sl="en">This agreement is about the serious balance between fighting terrorism and protecting the freedoms of our citizens. Tomorrow in my constituency of London, we celebrate the anniversary of the 7/7 bombing. We all know what this agreement is about, but balance is critical. In any negotiation, there must be give and take, but my group believes that EU citizens can feel that their Parliament, working with an effective Presidency, secured many of the safeguards they expect and an agreement which would infinitely outstrip the negative potential of 27 bilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements may not contain elements such as judicial redress on a non-discriminatory basis, rectification and erasure and a prohibition on data mining and profiling. Better an EU deal with real safeguards than bilateral agreements with unknown consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">For all of these reasons, our group will support this renegotiated deal and proudly stand by the safeguards we have helped to secure with the rapporteur and all of the other groups on behalf of EU citizens and their freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="de">The text of this agreement is not perfect. However, in the months between today and February, when we rejected the first version, Parliament has shown itself to be a reliable and responsible player. We have been constructive from the start. It has never been our goal to obstruct the whole process for no reason, because combating terrorism is as important for us as it is for our American partners, but, at the same time, we wish to stick to our own values and principles.</p>
      <p sl="de">So let us vote on this new agreement and let us focus on the future and make sure that both the Commission and the Council live up to their respective promises as enshrined in the agreement or attached to the agreement, because our ultimate goal remains a durable and legally sound European solution. We promised our citizens extraction of data by the EU on European soil – a promise that we have to keep.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the opposite of good is good intentions. The ways and means by which the previous Conservative, Social Democrat and Liberal speakers have justified their prearranged support for the new SWIFT Agreement suggest to me that they are following the principle of attack being the best form of defence, rather than that they are actually convinced by their own words.</p>
      <p sl="de">For the fact is that the new SWIFT Agreement has done practically nothing to change the substance of the criticism that this House clearly expressed by an overwhelming majority in its rejection in February and its resolution of March. An enormous amount of personal bank data pertaining to citizens who will overwhelmingly be above all suspicion will continue to be transferred to the US authorities, to be stored there for five whole years, without any review by an independent judicial authority.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only the European police authority, Europol, which is itself interested in the results of investigations, will authorise the requests of the US authorities. All this is not only politically wrong and damaging to the defence of European fundamental rights, but it is also entirely contrary to European constitutional law. Both the European Court of Human Rights and the national constitutional courts, as well as the Data Protection Officers, have ruled that the fundamental mechanisms provided for in the agreement are in breach of the law. As the European Parliament, we have not even succeeded in asking our own legal services for an evaluation before the vote takes place.</p>
      <p sl="de">For these reasons, we as Parliament should not vote for such an agreement. As Greens, we would, for this reason, be in favour of a second rejection and a genuine negotiation of common principles with the United States, before expanding the exchange of information to such an extent.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Alexander Alvaro and his predecessor, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, as well as the US authorities and, in particular, the American Ambassador, Mr Kennard, for their hard work, perseverance and determination to produce another agreement and maintain a positive relationship between the EU and the US. We should congratulate the US in their sustained belief that progress was possible here, and for once again continuing down the route to an EU-US international agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that this time we are all here with a lot more goodwill and cohesion following six months of mostly successful but testing negotiations. Parliament has had to push hard to be heard and for its voice to be respected. What we are finally being presented with is an agreement which is not only new, but improved; one which we can live with, and one which we should be happy about, especially with vital lessons having been learned within our Parliament and within the EU institutions. The deal is good compared with last time, including, as it does now, a judicial review, EU oversight, review procedures and blocking mechanisms. It represents for us the future possibility of our own EU TFTP system. It is certainly more equal, more open and more democratic.</p>
      <p sl="en">For those Members who have remaining concerns, it is not perfect, but may I remind this House that we do not live in a perfect world. Indeed, we live in a world full of dangers, as Claude Moraes highlighted a moment ago in relation to London. That is exactly why this agreement is needed. It is why we do not just have a duty to protect the data and the rights of our citizens, but also to protect their ongoing security and their safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last night in committee, this agreement was overwhelmingly adopted. It was a victory for common sense and I hope the same result can be echoed within this House when we vote together. Now is the time to put aside our individual ideals and be practical for the sake of the people we represent. Now is the time for the reputation of the EU as a serious international body to be renewed. Now is the time for us to behave reasonably and responsibly. Now is the time for this House to vote in favour of the text, which my group will certainly do.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what are we talking about? We are talking about almost 90 million financial messages per month, a figure that equates to more than one billion financial messages per year. These financial messages originate from Europe, either between European countries or between Europe and the rest of the world. For months and years, this is what we have referred to in this Parliament as bulk data, the block transfer of data.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Parliament considered refusing the transfer of bulk data, for the first time, in February, when it rejected the agreement. It did this for a second time in May, with a resolution in which it clearly stated that the transfer of bulk data is illegal. Now the transfer of bulk data is here. This is the substance of the agreement; the substance of the agreement does not change, and everybody in this House knows that very well. Therefore, there are good reasons for continuing to vote against it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This agreement has many weak points. When they tell us that it gives the right to judicial review, to transparency … my dear ladies and gentlemen, we know all too well that this is an executive agreement with the White House. The American law is not changing; it is not passing through Congress. European citizens residing in the United States of America are discriminated against because of such an agreement. The many beautiful words in the agreement do not have any kind of basis in practice, and well we know it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yet, they then present us with the crucial issue concerning the role of Europol. It must, however, be stated clearly that Europol is not charged with the protection of data. We have a European Data Protection Supervisor which the European Commission and the European Council never wanted to include in this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Europol is an agency which must be controlled because it benefits from this agreement. It receives police clues, but it is not a filtering agency which serves to protect the data of European citizens. We know that this is wrong; we know that it is both illegal and unconstitutional. Yet only yesterday, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs did Parliament a disservice by refusing to ask the opinion of Parliament’s Legal Service on Europol’s role here, which we know is very wrong.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Left Group will ask the Legal Service for that opinion – and I would like to thank our fellow Member, Mr Alvaro, who has worked hard and has been transparent in his work, cooperating with rapporteurs from each group – because, my dear friends, we can choose whether we want to know or not. We are charged with the task, as legislators, of foreseeing the legal implications of this agreement, and the Left Group will vote resolutely against this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this agreement is proposed under the Lisbon Treaty and therefore lacks all democratic legitimacy. The peoples of Europe were systematically denied referenda on the Lisbon Treaty because the Europhile political elite knew that they would reject it.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a problem that will come back to haunt us continually in the years to come. You have created an illegal state and now you are making illegal laws! Look at the way that this was done. Those few MEPs who were given access to this secret report, or secret agreement, were only allowed to see it after signing a declaration of honour not to reveal its contents. Most importantly, the people of Europe, to whom the information actually belongs, are totally unaware of its contents. More specifically, the proposed legislation is illegal under existing UK data protection law governing the international transfer of private citizens’ personal details. Under the Act, such information cannot be shared without the consent of the individuals concerned. The US authorities have already shown that they simply help themselves to such data as and when they feel fit. The USA cannot be trusted to observe other nations’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The confidential and private financial data in question belongs to the individual – and not to the European Union or the European Parliament. They have no right to share it with the USA or anybody else. Britain’s representative on the Council appears to have overridden existing national law in order to reach this agreement. By what right? However, we all know that the totally undemocratic and illegitimate EU legislation takes precedence over national democratic law!</p>
      <p sl="en">Terrorism has to be opposed, but it must not be used as a cloak to remove citizens’ rights and protections. This is just the latest example of how the EU is creating an undemocratic, illegitimate political state. The UK Independence Party will vote against.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a preliminary remark. To accept or to reject, either decision is worthy of respect. What is not acceptable, however, are certain exaggerations, half-truths and falsehoods, frequently devoid of any knowledge of the facts, which have also been voiced in the published debate. More objectivity and less emotion would surely have been fitting.</p>
      <p sl="de">To come to the point, fighting terrorism is just as much about the defence of democratic values and freedoms. One of these also requires the use of data, while the other requires a high degree of data protection. It is precisely here that, under pressure from the European Parliament, we were able to achieve a great deal: verification that a request is actually founded on a legitimate suspicion of terrorism, and daily checks by EU officials in the US Treasury Department that only data pertaining to suspected terrorists are being examined, including the possibility of stopping the extraction of data. We in Parliament are convinced that this important function must be regulated in agreement with all institutions. Compliance with standards, with the involvement of the Data Protection Officers, must be reviewed annually, and, for a storage period of five years, an annual audit to ensure that data which is not required is deleted in good time.</p>
      <p sl="de">To reiterate, intra-European transfers are not affected. Nonetheless, not everything was achieved.</p>

It puts the final verdict in the hands of the courts, rather than the policy makers, where it belongs. Concluding international agreements that are not legally watertight is a risky strategy. This agreement is therefore no reason for jubilation, but it is the least bad option.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although I share many of the doubts and concerns of the ‘no’ voters, rejection will not result in a better agreement and we all know that. Why? Because the Member State governments – not the US Government, our own governments – insist that the bank data of European citizens be processed by third countries. It is only thanks to the European Parliament that our personal data will, in future, be filtered by European authorities under our own control. Putting an end to the bulk data transfer in the longer term is major progress that we should recognise.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The reality is that this agreement is not obviously any different, at least on the main points which motivated the opposition of the European Parliament in February. There are still cases of haphazard data transfer, and there is still the retention of data for five years. There is still effectively no right of recourse for European citizens on American territory, and there is the very important question raised by Mr Tavares concerning Europol. Europol is not a judicial institution, and it is not me who says that – it is the texts, the treaties. The European and national data protection supervisors are all in agreement on these essential points.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, what was negotiated for the SWIFT Agreement and is now to be sold as data protection is, in fact, an embarrassing act of self-deception on the part of Europeans. As long as citizens guilty of no crime can, by means solely of transfers external to Europe thanks to data packets, come into the sights of the US secret services, it is apparent that a mockery will be made of data protection.</p>
      <p sl="de">For they say, quite tersely, that narrowing it down to single individuals is currently not technically possible. If limiting transfer data to specific requests is not yet achievable, then these data should simply not be provided, and that should be an end to it. Once the agreement is implemented, you can be sure that no one will care in the slightest about setting limits.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU’s own monitoring system which is to be set up will turn out, within a few years, to be a placebo, a sedative for critics. Storing up limitless data packets over so long a period of time – and five years from the point of view of information law is a small eternity – in the absence of any judicial intervention runs contrary to our understanding of a modern state founded on the rule of law. An increase in data protection is thus nowhere in sight in this agreement.</p>

It is vital for us to accept this in July as it will be the key to security. It is also important, for data protection reasons, that data are not transferred without any control. Further guarantees have been incorporated in the text, partly in relation to the justification for data disclosure and partly in relation to the justification for data prioritisation. From now on, the legal remedies offered will be transparent. There are, of course, unresolved issues, as previously mentioned by fellow Members: the rationale behind EUROPOL and the length of the storage period. In addition to the content, it is also important that we now have a clear schedule for developing a European TFTP – we will receive a proposal for this within a year – and that the relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament will be different from now on.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this has been an impassioned debate. I value the submissions of the various political groups and speakers, but I can only conclude that the debate being held throughout Europe, in all parliaments, concerns a balance between security and the fight against terrorism, on the one hand, and data protection and the protection of privacy, on the other. We must keep a close eye on this balance. This is an evolutionary process. We produced agreements, those agreements were rejected in this House, and now we have produced a new agreement that is significantly better and will continue to evolve. I am confident that this agreement represents a major step forward, and that the framework agreement on data protection between the European Union and the United States of America, which requires further negotiation and which may have a bearing, will also be adopted. We shall be looking at how supervision is organised, partly under the oversight of the Commission, so that we can carry out professional European supervision in the United States.

It is easy to criticise a system involving the United States, but then we must be consistent and do what has now been agreed here; that is, to develop Europe’s own system. I believe that this is the next step, and so I have every confidence that giving consent represents a positive contribution to increasing security in Europe and that, at the same time, more of our own instruments will be developed to enable us to employ a European way of working to an even greater degree. I hope, therefore, that this agreement will now receive Parliament’s consent.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you for this debate. You may or may not like this agreement. All agreements that we make, whether internally between the institutions or with a third country, are the result of tough negotiations, hard efforts and compromise. Compromise is the very essence of the Community method. It is not always 100%, but usually it is a decent compromise and we can live with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may not like it, but I think it is unfair to say that this agreement is equivalent to the one you voted down in February. That is simply not true. Considerable improvements have been made concerning data protection, fundamental rights and integrity. The requests will be as narrowly tailored as possible: there are several review and scrutiny mechanisms, and the idea of an EU TFTP mechanism has also been mooted. It was not even on the agenda a few months ago, and this has been done thanks to you, your very constructive and responsible approach to this, and through hard negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has also been made possible thanks to the constructive, open and very determined approach by our US counterparts. They have listened, they have understood our concerns, and together we have come to an agreement that takes these into consideration, but is also a tool to fight terrorism and, hopefully, save lives in the future. I am ready to discuss the further details and the development of this, the future TFTP mechanism, and the implementation of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, I should like to thank everybody involved – the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the Council and the political groups – for this very constructive report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I believe that we must make a note of two things in connection with this discussion. The first is that the European Parliament has provided proof of the fact that, following the Treaty of Lisbon, it is ready to work in collaboration. Mr Garrido has stated that he had underestimated the European Parliament. I believe that he has, not only in its willingness to work together but also in its willingness to show responsibility. I believe that we have hereby opened a new era in the sphere of EU lawmaking.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now I turn to my fellow Members who have just spoken in opposition. With all due respect for your opposition, I expect the same respect for the truth. The fact is that we have achieved a medium-term solution to how we can prevent bulk data transfer. Previously in this agreement, there was no provision that secured a legally binding cessation of bulk data transfers in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="de">To claim now that we should have done it overnight is as realistic as phasing out nuclear power overnight, which is also politically and practically not possible. Thus, we must allow a little more honesty to prevail, which I await with all due mutual respect.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Instead of the ‘swift’ SWIFT Agreement they were aiming for, the involvement of Parliament forced Commission and the US Administration to negotiate a ‘good’ SWIFT Agreement. And that is a major victory for Europe and for the future of transatlantic relations. Yes, the final agreement took a little longer to reach, but it achieved a much better balance between fighting terrorism and protecting fundamental rights than was the case a few months ago. It demonstrated that Parliament is a serious interlocutor that can exercise its new powers responsibly and effectively. And it brought a new – and much needed – spirit of openness and cooperation in the American Administration’s relations with the EU. This is not a perfect agreement. I would hope, for example, that the Commission could devise a way to station in Europol a representative of the European Data Protection Supervisor to oversee those initial bulk data grants, just as we have succeeded in stationing an EU overseer in Treasury. But when all is said and done, I firmly believe that this much-improved agreement – as opposed to the highly problematic interim agreement of last February – deserves this Parliament’s consent.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would like to congratulate the Commission for the result that it has achieved at the end of these difficult negotiations. This agreement meets the demands expressed by Parliament a few months ago. The US authorities have agreed to introduce a large number of guarantees on data protection which were lacking in the previous agreement. The effectiveness of these data transfers in the fight against terrorism has been highlighted many times these last few months. It is now time, however, for the Union to have its own mechanism available for combating the financing of terrorism. In this regard, I welcome the desire displayed by the Commission to go forward in this area, and I would ask them to propose specific actions as soon as possible. Finally, this ‘Swift affair’ has been an opportunity for Parliament to exercise the new powers conferred on it by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Member States, as well as our partners from third countries, now know that they must work hand in hand with this House in the adoption of these agreements. The contents of this agreement are testament to these new institutional relations. Our concerns have been heard, and reasonable answers have been found.</p>

      <p sl="de">Under the guise of combating terrorism, the account data of honest European citizens are being transferred in bulk to the United States. The re-hashed SWIFT Agreement does very little to change this situation. We cannot promise our citizens adequate data protection, because: Sensitive data is stored wholesale, instead of only in individual cases where there are grounds for suspicion. The data will be arbitrarily stored for a full five years. Compliance with data protection is intended to be guaranteed by Europol, even though this agency has an interest in the data itself. The executive is therefore monitoring itself – is this seriously supposed to be an independent control body? EU citizens whose rights have been violated have de facto no chance of taking successful legal action. Citizens would first have to cope with the cost of instituting legal proceedings in the United States! What was first celebrated as a success for the European Parliament in February has now become a washout. Even the rapporteur admits that he is not totally satisfied. It does not provide any real, effective data protection and should therefore be rejected.</p>

      <p sl="de">The SWIFT Agreement now being proposed is a clear improvement, as SEPA has been removed and it now contains a definition of terrorism. However, the political debates on the subject of SWIFT clearly indicate how difficult and important it is to find and preserve a balance between citizens’ rights and a commitment to security in the world. Many questions remain open and in need of answers. For example: 1) Why must the data be stored for a full five years? 2) I think that if we had had a longer negotiation period, we would certainly have been able to revise the weak areas and involve our own legal service; we would then have been able to draw up an agreement that was acceptable to everyone – both the EU and the United States. In my opinion, even after its revision and with various concessions, this agreement still does not take account of proportionality between security interests and respect for privacy. Finally, I am convinced that a longer negotiation period for both sides – the US and Europe – would have enabled us to achieve better, more detailed results. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should merely like to point out that with today’s decision, we are doing something that we wanted to do in 2004 and that the Council rejected in the spring of 2004: namely, to widen the auditing possibilities for Eurostat, to increase the scope of its powers and to automate the audit process.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the first important legislative step in response to the experiences of the last few weeks as far as the crisis is concerned. Eurostat’s independence must be strengthened and its dependence on data from the Member States reduced. Today’s developments are a step in the right direction, but in my opinion, we have not reached a conclusion. There must be the possibility for control visits to be made at any time in the Member States without prior arrangement, and all relevant data must be available for examination.</p>
      <p sl="de">Collaboration with the European Central Bank needs to be intensified, and we must ensure that Eurostat receives increased funding and more staff, combined with high quality training for the latter.</p>
      <p sl="de">What does the European Parliament want in addition? Sanctions against Member States which falsify statistics and supply false statistics. The Commission must present Parliament with a comprehensive report on the mistakes of the last six years. We want to know where the mistakes occurred and what these mistakes were – whether in matters of policy, of law, or of jurisdiction – so that we can draw the appropriate conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission should put a harmonisation of statistical data collection and a harmonisation of criteria for statistics authorities in the Member States on the table and push ahead with it. Today, we are taking a correct and significant step towards independence and an increase in powers, but we are not finished yet. We must carry on further along this road.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it has become a journalistic cliché to talk about the events in Greece as a tragedy, but I think we can fairly define them as a tragedy in the classic Sophoclean sense. We had the hubris of the boom years when we pretended that Greek and German debt were interchangeable. Now we have the nemesis of the overdue market correction.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the catharsis has been artificially stayed. Rather than allowing a natural market correction, which is to say, Greece minting its own currency and pricing itself back into the European markets, we are instead pursuing this policy of pretending that better statistics or more regional aid or more shifting around of money through sales taxes or European debt agencies will somehow postpone the inevitable.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, what we are doing is condemning the people of Greece and – I hope I am wrong – possibly the people of the other Mediterranean countries to years of recession, stagnation and unemployment – but we are at least generating employment for ourselves because we are justifying our own existence.

I think we can all understand that there should be better data collection as regards the state of our national economies. But the issue is that this should not be used as an excuse for what has been called ‘European economic governance’. It should not be used as an excuse for the EU institutions, the Commission, to have access to the national budgets of Member States before these national budgets are presented to the parliaments of those countries.</p>

The document discusses the Baltic Sea strategy and its principal objective – to encourage the coordination of Member States’ actions in policies which have a territorial impact. This strategy is based on four fundamental policies, one of which is the safeguarding of an ecologically sustainable environment. Therefore, I am very pleased that this document also reflects my amendments concerning the planning and implementation of energy infrastructure projects around the Baltic Sea, which could have a certain impact on Baltic Sea ecosystems. We also have to ensure appropriate maritime principles, reduce the impact of agriculture on the Baltic Sea, and I agree entirely with the European Parliament’s opinion that at the heart of the strategy, we must strengthen cooperation with third countries.

      <p sl="lv">I refer, therefore, to the strategy for the Baltic Sea region. The Baltic Sea region contains great development opportunities, and this strategy has already received a certain amount of financing from the European Union. Nevertheless, a small unit is needed that would be specifically charged with implementation of the strategy for the Baltic Sea region. There is also a need for specific, coordinated programmes for collaboration with private enterprise, for innovation and for developing research. The action plan for the strategy for the Baltic Sea region provides for a unified patent policy, a cooperation network between individual small- and medium-sized enterprises, and the formation of a Baltic Sea fund for research and innovation. Future economic growth in the Baltic Sea region will, as elsewhere, depend directly on a successful innovations policy. The implementation of the Rail Baltic project has been postponed for too long – it must be completed as soon as possible. The report on the strategy for the Baltic Sea region notes the need to increase the competitiveness of the Baltic region, but a precondition for this is the development of innovation and infrastructure projects, and that is why I also supported this report.</p>

      <p sl="lv">As regards the report on regional policy, the second objective of cohesion policy provides for aid to be given to European regions that are experiencing unemployment, crime and rapid depopulation. The financial framework sets aside EUR 54.7 million for this purpose, but there are still great economic disparities among European Union Member States, and it is precisely the poorest regions that have suffered most from the economic crisis. Aid for these states must be regarded as the absolute priority of European Union regional policy. The first step for the European Union, without which sustainable development is impossible, is the establishment of fair competition and economic equality. Regional policy must continue to support those European regions with a GDP lower than the average European Union indicators. The position that elastic financing must continue to be developed should be supported. Nevertheless, we should aim for financial and practical support of this kind for small- and medium-sized enterprises engaged in innovation [and for support to] technologies and enterprises, which also has my full support.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, which are the richest countries in Europe, or rather, the countries with the wealthiest citizens in Europe? I was looking at the OECD data the other day and in 2008, which is the latest year for which we have figures, the countries that are most prosperous are the members of the European Free Trade Association – despite everything they have gone through! Despite a banking crisis that disproportionately impacted Switzerland and Iceland, income per head in the EEA countries is 214% of what it is in the European Union. These guys in EFTA are twice as rich as the citizens of the EU Member States!</p>
      <p sl="es">Why is that? Let me suggest that it might have something to do with the deal that they have struck with the European Union, whereby they are in the free market, in the four freedoms – free movement of goods and services and people and capital – but they are outside the common fisheries policy and outside the common agricultural policy, they control their own borders and determine who can cross them, they settle their own human rights issues, they control their own energy reserves and they can buy and sell to third countries without being subject to the common external tariff.</p>

Have we learned the lesson that it was inappropriate regulation in the United States that forced banks to lend to uncreditworthy customers, thereby leading inevitably to the subprime crisis when one in ten of those taking out loans were uncreditworthy customers who could not pay back those loans and we felt the effects across the world? Have we learned the lesson of those governments that print money as if money has no value, but forget the lessons of what was said by the Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises, the only economist to have predicted the financial crisis? He said that money has a value and when you make money cheap, companies and individuals make what he calls ‘malinvestments’ and that creates a credit bubble and eventually the market catches up and the whole thing collapses. That is what we did, that is how the financial crisis started and let us make sure we learn those lessons.</p>

This strong position of ours will make it possible to provide better protection for the rights of passengers, especially people with physical disabilities and restricted mobility. The proposal is to repeal Article 11 and thus make it impossible to refuse to make a reservation for disabled people, and we are also imposing an obligation on firms to provide assistance free of charge when boarding buses and during the journey, as is the case with air transport. This will allow physically disabled people to travel independently around Europe, improving their quality of life.

I am particularly concerned about the area of rural transport. Probably urban and regional transport will be all right but, when it comes to rural transport, I think we may be in danger – if this legislation goes through – of finding a situation where rural transport operators will no longer continue to work those routes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We always talk in this Parliament about overburdening SMEs and about costs and so on. I think that, in the current economic situation, a reasonable compromise would be to allow an exemption for a fixed period of time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive on the reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States because I believe that the creation of a maritime transport space without barriers could make coastal shipping more efficient. Maritime goods transport is indeed subject to very complex administrative procedures.</p>
      <p sl="it">On top of this situation, there is also the problem of a lack of harmonised regulation of the sector, due to the varying implementation of the 2002 directive in the different Member States. A precise and detailed directive which reduces the possibility of different interpretations as much as possible is therefore necessary.</p>

It is not, however, enough on its own. We need a dramatic change in attitude, not just in Parliament but also in the Member States, because we know that youth unemployment has been allowed to become far too high. It is as much as around 20% in the European Union, and it just cannot go on like this. In other words, we need practical measures both in the Member States and at Union level, and not so many different resolutions and speeches. Instead, we need very practical action.</p>

Then there are the objectives of the European Union’s EU 2020 strategy. It is still projected that economic recovery will come through innovation, green technologies and the inclusion of young people in the labour market and that is very important.

As for compost, namely that involving biological waste, we need to consider and assess the opportunities for the use of low-grade compost, so that we do not harm people or the environment. At European Union level, once we have defined opportunities for the use of low-grade compost and have determined when compost is considered a product and when it is considered waste, it would be easier for Member States to find their way when resolving issues regarding compost use.

      <p sl="ro">Mediterranean coastal zones continue to experience high pressures on the environment and increased degradation of coastal resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Urban sprawl is intense in the Mediterranean, entailing the gradual loss of natural areas and biodiversity, and increasing competition for water resources. Coastal erosion problems and flooding of low-lying coastlines are exacerbated by urban encroachment on the near shore area and floodplains. Projected population growth concentrated in coastal urban areas, a near doubling of tourist flows and even greater transport growth are likely to exacerbate the pressures. Nearly 50% of the coastline could be built up by 2025, marking an increase from 40% in 2000. Moreover, the Mediterranean basin features among the most vulnerable areas as regards the impact of climate change.</p>

Europe must provide all possible tools and support to Frontex and must strive for the work of the agency to be as geographically extensive and qualitatively effective as possible. Immigration and border control has, until now, been one of the most underestimated challenges facing the European Union, which too often has sought to hide from the idea that border protection and the prevention of uncontrolled immigration are tasks which Europe must deal with as a whole.</p>

Certain Member States, and I am thinking of Lithuania, scoff at the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention on Human Rights. Valdemar Tomaševski, a Member of the European Parliament, has been called to account by the Lithuanian Parliament for his defence, made in the European Parliament, of the rights of minorities in Lithuania. This situation is reprehensible, unacceptable and scandalous. I appeal to the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights and the European Commission to ensure that European Union standards on questions of fundamental rights, liberties and the rights of national minorities are raised to the highest level and effectively enforced.</p>

The Chief Official Ethics Commission of the Republic of Lithuania has issued a public admonition to Mr Tomaševski on the basis of the Code of Conduct for State Politicians. A situation in which a public institution of a Member State admonishes an MEP for words which he spoke in connection with the performance of his duties as an MEP is unacceptable.

It will allow territories which are different, but which face similar problems, to undertake joint action within a flexible institutional framework.

The resolution on the European Union Strategy for the Baltic Sea region, which the European Parliament approved today with the support of the ALDE Group, is oriented towards Lithuanian opportunities. The strategy aims to reduce the dependence of the Baltic region on Russian energy, to link the energy networks of countries in the region and diversify energy sources, to ensure the extension of a railway axis from Berlin to the Baltic coast, and resolve the difficulties of crossing the border with Russia. These are four particularly important steps for Lithuania. In addition, together with other MEPs, we were able to draw attention to the fact that the European Commission has to watch and monitor whether the same approach and international conventions are followed in the neighbouring countries, especially in those which are planning to build nuclear power plants near external EU borders. All of the countries of the Baltic region, including Russia and Belarus, must adhere to the most stringent nuclear safety and environmental standards.

      <p sl="fr">In truth, however, the essential part of this report is the promotion of macro-regions as an additional ‘level of governance’, and perhaps, though only in the future, as part of the European Union’s ‘cohesion’ policy. This cohesion would involve amalgamating regions on both sides of borders, if possible in the form of European groups of local and regional authorities, and these groups would necessarily have legal personality and choose, in a ‘sovereign’ manner, the national law that will govern them.

We should also require adherence to the highest standards and good cooperation from our neighbours, particularly those planning to build their nuclear power plants near EU borders. Unfortunately, I would hardly call the Belarusian decision to locate a new nuclear power plant just 25 kilometres from the Lithuanian border and 50 kilometres from the capital Vilnius a friendly gesture. None of the capitals of the other EU Member States are so close to the Union’s external borders and would not face such a situation. Environmental NGOs in Belarus are sounding warning signals because, in their opinion, international safety and environmental standards are not being adhered to in the planning and construction of the power plant. There is concern that the presentation of the project to both Belarusian and Lithuanian society is being organised in a superficial way and does not respond to the main issues. The EU cannot forbid the construction of nuclear power plants right next to the Union’s borders. However, together we can negotiate with the Belarusian Government on the location of the construction.

Regional policy should be viewed as a long-term EU development policy which champions renewed competitiveness and employment in the Member States. The fight against the economic and financial crisis has also assisted in the speeding up and simplification of cohesion policy programmes that I believe to be of the utmost importance for greater rectification of budgetary policy. This is also needed to combat the current difficult environment: by speeding up programmes, it will contribute to strengthening the EU, the Member States and their regions. It is therefore essential to proceed with the goal of greater competitiveness, sustainability and flexibility for these programmes in the context of a globalised world. I also believe that it is essential to continue to pay special attention to the regions mentioned in Objective 2 through assistance in the economic and social conversion of these areas, demonstrating their full potential, and promoting the coordination of all their means and tools in order to promote growth and employment.</p>

Unfortunately, the so-called Objective 2 regions of Europe have paid a very high price in unemployment and social exclusion terms as a result of the crisis.

      <p sl="fr">We need to know that the European Union’s regional policy is the main European factor in reviving the economy; as the report emphasises, it is the most important source of EU investment in the real economy. It is important, however, that the economic revival in our regions does not just take place now, but also over the medium and long term. This is why the Kratsa report, which I voted for, aims to combat structural problems, particularly concerning competitiveness and employment. Today, all the actors in our regions are affected by the crisis. Small and medium-sized enterprises, for example, are encountering more and more difficulties in making use of micro-financing and micro-credit. A fundamental objective for us, therefore, is to make our regions more attractive, which will allow us to eventually increase investment in our regions should this be necessary.</p>

In the context of the global financial and economic crisis and the current economic slowdown, EU regional policy is a key delivery instrument, making a decisive contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan. I believe that in future, regional policy must be based on the priorities laid down in the EU 2020 strategy, such as smart, sustainable growth achieved by exploiting new ways of achieving sustainable economic growth and promoting better business conditions with fair competition, job creation, entrepreneurship and innovation for all the regions, developing SMEs and supporting their growth potential. The use of Structural Funds is particularly relevant in the context of regional policy and therefore, I believe that an increase in the flexibility of the Structural Funds would allow us to begin the planned programmes immediately, the implementation of which would contribute to the improvement of the economic and social situation in individual regions.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Union has always paid scant attention to the world of SMEs, committing itself more to words than to deeds in policies focused on competitiveness and innovation. Above all, this Europe is far removed from local institutions and from those administrative bodies that are furthest from the centre but closest to the citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the fundamental arguments expounded by the rapporteur in her report, on which we are voting today, the fundamental logic that she outlines, is commendable, because, from my point of view, it pays due attention to the need to make greater use of EU funds to combat the crisis and the impoverishment of depressed areas or areas at risk of economic and social decline. Moreover, as the report suggests, it is the truly vast world of SMEs that the EU should target today with new and more consistent efforts, if it really does want to help pull the continent out of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our SMEs, which make up 99% of Europe’s productive fabric, need freedom from bureaucracy.

      <p sl="ro">In order to beat this crisis, the EU must step up its efforts and invest in skills, vocational training and in creating sustainable jobs. The objective of the EU 2020 strategy should be to launch effectively an extensive European initiative on employment which will, for instance, reinforce activation schemes, particularly for the low-skilled, through personalised advice, intensive training or retraining and upskilling of workers, apprenticeships, subsidised employment and non-refundable start-up grants for the self-employed and businesses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These measures can be financed by the Payments Committee of the European Social Fund. Early intervention is required at the moment when jobs are actually lost, not least in order to reduce the risk of people becoming excluded from the labour market.

      <p sl="fr">I join the rapporteur in emphasising the particular importance of Objective 2. While the Structural Funds must definitely contribute first and foremost to helping regions lagging behind in terms of development to catch up, the other regions must have access to financing adapted to the problems they face. Since the 2006 reform, Objective 2 has been contributing to the strengthening of regional competitiveness and employment, with financing of EUR 54.7 billion for the period 2007-2013. This investment in the competitiveness of the regional economies is all the more relevant in a period of economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is through efforts in innovation, research and development that the European Union will be able to regain and stabilise sustainable growth and skilled jobs. In the context of the debate on the European financial perspectives for the post-2013 period, it is essential that the European Parliament remembers its commitment to Objective 2. The cohesion policy must remain a strong and well-financed policy, and I would therefore emphasise the necessity of retaining the financial resources for Objective 2.

In the context of the economic and financial crisis that the EU is currently experiencing, regional and cohesion policy and, in particular, Objective 2 programmes are taking on greater importance in the process of economic recovery, as a stimulus for competitiveness and the creation of jobs at regional and local level, providing essential support for public investment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore believe that the introduction of greater flexibility is quite positive, and that the simplification of cohesion policy programmes is vital.

It is essential to help disadvantaged areas to develop, to enhance the efficient allocation of funds for innovation, technology and education, and to implement measures to stimulate employment and competitiveness, in particular.

The document warmly supports the key priorities of the EU 2020 strategy, and calls for further strengthening of policies to enhance it through measures to capitalise on Europe’s single market. We should remember that such priorities are the same as those recognised by the revamped Lisbon Strategy, the same as those that justified and promoted the processes of privatising public services, deregulating dismissals and the decline in working conditions, increasing unemployment and the campaign for social regression – that is, the structural causes of the systematic crisis of capitalism that we are facing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The structural funds, or any other financial tool for regional policy which is primarily aimed at cohesion, should be geared towards a genuine stake in economic development and social progress, territorial cohesion and reducing regional disparities.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, today we are discussing the economic and financial crisis, but can we really learn from the lessons of this crisis? Inadequate regulation in the United States of America, when banks gave loans to insolvent clients who were unable to repay these, inevitably led to the toxic loan crisis and we will continue to feel the consequences of this throughout the world for a long time to come. Therefore, European Union regional policy is becoming a key part of the Economic Recovery Plan, constituting the main Community source of investment in the real economy, but the EU lacks effective mechanisms for economic coordination and balanced growth. Cohesion policy, through the Structural Funds and other actions, is of prime importance. Regional policy is not just a means to immediately damp down the negative impact of the economic and social crisis, but is also a long-term policy for combating the structural problems revealed and created against the background of the crisis, particularly as regards competitiveness and employment in the Member States. It is also important for Lithuania to recover from the crisis as quickly as possible and to devote particular attention to increasing competitiveness and employment in the Member States.</p>

This assistance is essential – particularly the assistance for SMEs, which have been seriously weakened by the economic crisis –and must be increased.

The own-initiative report calls for an increase of more than 25% specifically for the regions in Objective 2 in order to increase competitiveness. This is to be done within the regional policy budgetary framework. No proper impact assessments have been carried out in this regard. An overall assessment of the 450 programmes falling under the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund and the most recent Globalisation Adjustment Fund from 2007 is required to see how these forms of support work from a social and gender-related perspective. They currently overlap one another, resulting in a lack of clarity. I also do not agree with the report that the EU’s regional policy in particular is crucial for European recovery.

      <p sl="en">Due to the lack of a single, effective mechanism for economic coordination and balanced growth within the European Union, cohesion policy is playing a leading role in helping us get back on our feet. In particular, Objective 2 of the Structural Funds has been – and remains – one of the most important pillars of cohesion policy, especially in the context of exiting the economic crisis. For countries like Lithuania, more flexible access to the EU regional funds would go a long way to help the recovery of areas worst hit by the crisis. This flexible funding could create new jobs and would have to include diverse areas: investment for infrastructure, support for small firms, professional training, and industrial and rural modernisation. It is important that these instruments are not solely used as fire-fighting interventions. Our efforts must also be focused on long-term restructuring outcomes and the transition to a more sustainable economy – flexibility is also crucial for long-term policy. Objective 2 and other cohesion policy branches can also help once again to narrow the gap between EU Member States.

      <p sl="cs">Bus and coach transport is the only form of transport where there is still no pan-European measure on passenger rights. The persistence of varying levels of passenger protection depending on the form of transport being used is unacceptable. I therefore voted in favour of the report on passenger rights in bus and coach transport. The Member States unfortunately work hand-in-glove with the transport operators, and oppose stronger passenger rights. However, the European Parliament is bringing certainty that persons travelling by bus and coach will have the same rights as those travelling by plane or by rail. I applaud the fact that, in the event of culpable delays in arrival, passengers will have the right to compensation amounting to 25% of the ticket price for delays longer than one hour, and 50% of the ticket price for delays longer than two hours. In my opinion, passenger rights are also significantly strengthened by the possibility, in the event of a connection being cancelled or delayed by more than two hours, of passengers being able to decide between continuing to their destination without any additional charge or obtaining a refund of the ticket price and compensation amounting to 50% of the ticket price.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Another achievement is the right of passengers to claim for food, hotel accommodation and replacement services in the event of a cancellation or delay in departure by more than one hour on long-distance routes.

It cannot, however, treat the bus or coach transport sector, which essentially consists of small and medium-sized enterprises, in the same way as it treats an air or rail company, nor can it impose obligations which are proportionally more restrictive and much more costly for a small enterprise, which runs the risk of going out of business, than for a large multinational.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The enormous gap that exists between Parliament’s amendments, which are very dogmatic, and the compromise obtained in the Council, which is more pragmatic, also says a lot. Furthermore, I think that there is a fundamental iniquity in subjecting companies which are, by definition, ‘captives’ of European territory to the rigour of obligations proposed in case of accidents, while air or sea companies are regulated by international agreements which allow them to get out of paying compensation for the actual harm caused, as the tragic case of the Rio-Paris flight would seem to indicate.</p>

More particularly, I voted in favour of a large number of amendments which aimed to impose greater responsibility on transport companies in case of loss of or damage to luggage, and particularly in case of injury or death of passengers. Above all, I firmly supported the proposals aiming to strengthen the rights of disabled people and people with reduced mobility, to make transport accessible to such people, and also to provide them with information in accessible formats, because we have a responsibility in this area. I am disappointed that a compromise could not be found with the Council, which has showed itself to be quite unwilling to go forward.

These efforts often strike at the rights of disabled persons, who often encounter situations of discrimination when they try to be mobile and when they want to use transport services. The ban on discrimination on the grounds of reduced mobility in bus and coach transport is a great step forward in the fight for the right to equal participation in society by disabled persons. An important feature of the regulation on bus and coach transport services is the compensation for a cancellation or a delay affecting a service, which is something we are also familiar with in air transport. This should be standard in all types of transport services because it shows the carrier’s respect for the passengers. I feel the same way about the rules forcing transport firms to pay compensation to the victims of accidents, both for loss of health and for damage to luggage. They are steps in the right direction, because they strengthen the citizen’s position in relations with transport firms. In view of these rules, I decided to endorse the recommendation for second reading on the Council position at first reading for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004.</p>

It is crucial that consumers are given effective rights to ensure that liberalisation allows for real choice. We should not forget that 22 of the 27 EU Member States are coastal countries, so it is imperative to guarantee security and certainty for the users of these means of transport, so that we can bring measures of protection for these passengers into line with those for other means of transport. It is worth remembering that in some matters, the regulation of maritime passengers’ rights was scattered and disparate from state to state. With this new legal setup, the European public will be able to expect situations of delay, cancellation or denied boarding to be rectified immediately, and mandatory information for passengers and means of complaint and redress.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I believe that the provisions laid down by the European Parliament relating to passengers with disabilities or restricted mobility are particularly important, especially with regard to accessibility, non-discrimination and assistance.

      <p sl="pt">The present proposal is for the creation of a legal framework for the implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in Europe in the sphere of road transport and interfaces with other modes (global positioning system, automatic alarm system and traffic control instruments). This directive is intended to ensure greater inter-operability in the transport system and create an efficient cooperation system between all parties interested in the ITS. The four priority areas identified are: (i) better use of traffic routes and journey data; (ii) management of European transport corridors; (iii) road safety; and (iv) integration of vehicles into transport infrastructure. All these objectives will allow road transport to become more efficient, safer and greener, and will ensure better inter-operability with other modes of transport and, for this reason, creating the conditions for an effective application of ITS systems. The agreement made with the Council, and outlined in this recommendation, will, in the words of the rapporteur, pave the way ‘to make up for delays on ITS applications and services and remove inefficiencies on travelling by making transport more efficient, safer and secure while contributing to the policy objective of making transport cleaner’.</p>

We cannot forget that more bureaucracy means greater costs for companies and, often, loss of efficiency, which cannot be allowed in the times of crisis through which we are currently struggling. We know that administrative burdens (and the additional costs resulting from them) have made maritime freight transport less attractive and have been a serious impediment to its full development; this is despite this form of transport being less environmentally harmful and, for this reason, the one which should be most encouraged and supported, in a context of clean development.

However, I supported the amendment submitted on point 32, which introduced the notion of a European transport fund. It seems to me that an independent fund dedicated to transport would risk undermining the consistency of the cohesion policy, 60% of whose funds are allocated to transport.

      <p sl="it">We are of the opinion that more attention should be paid to safety in the transport sector as well, in terms of safety for the goods transported, for passengers and for the network in general.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European economy, and therefore employment, depends on the sustainable future of transport. Consequently, the Union must work quickly to provide Member States with some urgent objectives such as the timeframe for the realisation of small infrastructure, the lack of which hinders the smooth flow of goods and people, causing serious damage to the economy and worsening pollution.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need similar timeframes across Europe for the completion of these works, as well as certain timeframes for the repair of roads or railways closed owing to natural or unforeseen events. The conversion of some road transport to transport by rail or water, to this day slowed down by too many delays, is necessary to avoid the loss of jobs and the consequent impoverishment of part of the population.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, particular attention must be paid to peripheral or disadvantaged areas which remain so due to a lack of enough viable infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="ro">This decarbonisation can only bring about a significant reduction in the volume of exhaust gases, noise and also traffic bottlenecks if two conditions are met: external cost internalisation must cover all modes of transport and the revenue obtained must be used to improve infrastructure sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The effects of the financial and economic crisis on the transport sector must not be overlooked as this sector proved to be very vulnerable to the crisis. I believe that this crisis must be seen as an opportunity to offer targeted support to the transport sector in future by encouraging investments. These investments should not just provide swift assistance, but also help improve environmental performance and safety and also create new green jobs through developing both national instruments and European political instruments. The Commission and Member States must continue to exchange best practices (for example as part of the Mayors’ Convention and the CIVITAS initiative), offering communities the chance to learn from the experience of other European citizens.</p>

Unfortunately, however, the finances allocated to this sector are inadequate. The TEN-T budget for the 2007-2013 period is just EUR 8.013 billion, while the funds allocated to transport through the cohesion policy are a mere 11% of the total budget allocated to this policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the EU to allocate additional finances for developing the trans-European transport system and integrating it with the transport systems in the EU’s neighbouring countries. This is why I voted against Amendment 6. This amendment intends to replace the setting up of a transport fund which will have more resources than those already in the EU budget with a mechanism for coordinating the use of the various current sources of transport funding. It goes without saying that the EU must coordinate the existing sources of transport funding better, but it is absolutely essential to create new instruments for funding the work involved in developing the transport infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="en">At present, the Baltic States are, to a large extent, isolated from the European transport network. We must strive to integrate the Baltic Sea region more closely into the TEN-T priority axes, including the rail axis from Berlin to the Baltic coast (TEN-T 1) and the Motorways of the Sea (TEN-T 21). More emphasis should also be put on short sea shipping and inland waterway transport, which is cost-efficient as well as increasingly environmentally friendly. In order to remain competitive in the future, many European ports – such as Klaipeda in Lithuania – need to modernise their infrastructure. However, the effects of the financial crisis on the transport sector should not be overlooked. Given the scale of necessary transport investments, it is vital to ensure European cooperation and to prioritise projects prudently. There is more to transport than merely trucks, traffic and tariffs. Transport also relates to the freedom of movement for persons and goods, as well as the development of the European single market. It also boosts employment. Above all, as recent high-profile train and plane crashes tragically reminded us, safety must continue to be one of the priority areas of future transport policy.</p>

However, the persistent confusion between European and national competences and the competences of European institutions underlines the fact that European citizens are not yet totally aware of their rights. This is why, by voting for this report, I supported the introduction of better information relating to the petitions procedure. A European petition must allow citizens to share with Parliament their concerns about the impact of various European Union policies and legislation on their everyday lives.

Around 21.4% of young people in the EU are unemployed and kept at the margins of the economy; this becomes even more serious if we consider that with the ageing of the population, we are jeopardising the very economic and social future of the EU. It is also younger workers who have the jobs that are the most precarious: often temporary and of a low quality, with lower wages and less social security.</p>

Other social and economic risks and costs to our societies are associated with this pre-eminent problem of youth unemployment.

I feel that we cannot be resigned to losing young Europeans to social exclusion.

I recognise the existence of a clear separation between school and academic life and the labour market, as well as the need to close this gap so that there is an easier transition from school to employment, and proceed to the evaluation of the suitability of what is taught to professional life. If the current state of those in training is manifestly an improvement on what happened in the past, it is also true that in many cases, effective training that is appropriate to their needs and expectations is not given to today’s interns.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Given the current economic crisis, today in the EU, we have more than 5.5 million young people under 25 without jobs, a number equivalent to twice the overall unemployment rate. Youth unemployment results in a heavy social and economic cost to our society, leading to lost opportunities for economic growth, an erosion of the tax base which hinders investment in infrastructure and public services, an increase in social assistance costs and in the underuse of investment in education and training. Europe’s young people are a wealth of untapped human resources, and forecasts of the economic and social situation indicate that action is required.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Of greater concern, however, is the avocation of the concept of flexicurity as a way of ending youth unemployment and a form of transition from the educational system to the job market.

People under 25 are the first to be affected by the current economic crisis. Training policies for young people must therefore be ambitious to allow young people to acquire skills better adapted to the needs of businesses. There must be more internships and apprenticeships, but we must also ensure that these are of good quality in terms of the content of internships, the length of apprenticeships, and allowances paid to interns, in order to protect young people from potential abusive practices by their employers. The European Union must therefore promote mobilisation in this area, despite its limited ‘social’ competences, and this is the reason why I voted with conviction in favour of this resolution, which proposes some ways forward to cope with the difficult situation in which European young people find themselves.</p>

Young people often work for months on end without payment, hoping that they might still get a permanent job afterwards. This is an unsustainable situation. Internships should not destroy jobs. However, today’s plenary vote is going to pave the way in the future for a complete ban on unpaid internships. We believe that this gives a wrong message. It should still be possible to do a three-month unpaid internship, for example. There are numerous non profit-making or social organisations where a young person can acquire exciting, interesting experiences. However, such organisations are often unable to pay any remuneration for the internship. The key factor should be the duration of an internship. In the case of any internship lasting longer than six months, the employer can rely on productive output from the intern. From then on, remuneration should also be paid. The decision made today is impracticable and goes too far. We therefore do not support this part of the resolution.</p>

Today, more than 5.5 million young people under 25 are unemployed (21.4%), which is twice as high as the overall unemployment rate. Youth unemployment is one of Europe’s most pressing problems. This results in a loss of opportunities for economic growth and erosion of the tax base which undermines investment in infrastructure and public services, increased welfare costs and underutilised investment in education and training. All Member States must take action and fight youth unemployment by taking national specificities into account. We must ensure growth and create new jobs, especially for young people and prioritise business-education provider cooperation. Member States must secure equal access to education for all by guaranteeing a minimum right to free well-funded education from nursery school to university and by securing financial support for young students. We must encourage the Member States to invest further in education and training, even if fiscal and social constraints are present.

Unfortunately, today, we are witnessing a period of serious financial crisis, which has caused a significant increase in rates of unemployment, especially youth unemployment. Recently compiled statistics show, in fact, that more than 5.5 million young people under 25 are unemployed, equivalent to 21.4% of Europe’s youth population, which is twice as high as the overall unemployment rate. Faced with this situation, it was necessary to ask the Council and the Commission to develop an employment strategy focused on the creation of polices designed to guarantee young Europeans access to the labour market in order to prevent the social and economic costs that youth employment entails for our society. Another priority was the adoption of packages of measures for providing a strong incentive for investment in education, research and mobility, as well as possibilities for young people who want to set up their own business to access finance facilities more easily.</p>

The Commission and Member States were asked by Parliament to recommend minimum standards for internships. A European Quality Charter on Internships is to be proposed. I have been offering many young people for years the chance to do an internship in my MEP offices in Brussels or Strasbourg. I am therefore in favour of promoting the status of internships. During these times of globalised labour markets and the financial crisis, gaining sound, practically relevant training is particularly important. Internships offer an excellent opportunity for young people to find out about the demands of working life and test their own abilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">The requirement for this is that interns must work under fair terms where the focus is on the provision of training and not on replacing permanent employees.

Even if young people do find work, they are very often only given temporary contracts. Internships are also the cause of much emotion. On the one hand, they play a very useful role, making it possible for young people to gain important practical qualifications. On the other hand, in practice, they often mean that work which should be done by an employee is done for free by an internee. Some firms in Poland operate with the principle that any well-paid specialist can be replaced by a certain number of free internees. Such an approach does not have a good effect on the labour market, and even more so it does not help the position of employees. I very much welcome the fact that this problem has been taken up by Parliament and that this has resulted in a number of measures intended to improve the position of young employees.

Unemployment in numerous Member States of the European Union has recorded an unprecedented increase; a typical example is Greece, where unemployment among young people is currently 27.5%.

The idea is to see to it that a business can be created anywhere in the European Union in three days and without charges. Formal procedures for recruiting the first employees could take place through a single interface, by reinforcing activation schemes – particularly for people who are not well-qualified – through personalised advice, an intensive workers’ training or retraining course, improving their qualifications, and so on. I think that sustaining employment, as well as creating new employment prospects for the youngest people, but also for those who are on the jobs market but who no longer have jobs, is the sine qua non for Europeans to regain confidence in our social model. Furthermore, this confidence is essential for our future, as much for social reasons as for economic and political ones.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of the report on atypical contracts, career security, flexicurity and new forms of social dialogue. Atypical employment is defined by new forms of contract, which have one or more of the following characteristics: part-time, casual, temporary, fixed-term work, working from home and telecommuting, or part-time work for a period not exceeding 20 hours per week. The financial and economic crisis that the European Union is facing could lead to unstable work markets and growing social exclusion. For this reason, there is an urgent need to help Member States to safeguard as many jobs and as much employment in Europe as possible. We must step up efforts to invest in skills, training and sustainable employment, along with developing the promotion of the principles of flexicurity. Clear proposals and concrete measures to protect jobs and create employment opportunities should be proposed as part of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="it">My contribution was based along two lines. Firstly, the importance of the link between training courses and the needs of the labour market. In this regard, young people need to rethink their perception of manual professions which are today seen as a lowering of the person and of one’s social status, even if data confirm that these professions offer an important occupational choice, both in terms of integration into the workforce and in economic return.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly, the defence of a kind of flexibility which does not degenerate into exploitation of the person, condemning the worker to a lifetime of insecurity, and which does not conceal illegal intentions to replace forms of permanent working relationships. Rather, I support an intelligent flexibility which can intelligently adapt to the changed conditions of business’s modus operandi , responding to the needs of the market by guaranteeing employment and facilitating the integration of even the weakest groups into the world of work.</p>

It is a fact that the economic crisis has significantly exacerbated the number of atypical contracts and precarious work-related situations. These have a greater impact on young people and women. However, I believe that the European social model, whose objectives are focused on sustainable growth, full employment, the promotion of welfare and social protection, can provide the conditions and means necessary to steer the EU and its Member States through the crisis. In this respect, I would like to highlight two issues that I believe to be vital in the face of the current situation of economic crisis and abnormally high unemployment figures in the EU, with a view to protecting quality, decent employment and creating new job opportunities under the 2020 strategy. The first relates to the need for increased investment in skills and professional and lifelong training. The second relates to the importance of the effective implementation of flexicurity strategies, thus allowing a real fight against illegal employment and a reduction in employment insecurity.</p>

It also aims at redefining flexicurity policies, which have, in the past, concentrated too much on flexibility and not enough on security for workers. Atypical work includes part-time, fixed-term, temporary, teleworking, but also new types of contracts, such as ‘zero-hour’ contracts, and a growing trend in false self-employment. Although the aim of these contracts is to introduce flexibility in the labour market for both employers and employees, studies show that they are often associated with precarious work and consequent precarious income. These workers are often denied important rights including the right to training or to join a trade union. Our priority must be to fight all forms of precarious employment, and this priority has taken on special importance during this crisis. The crisis should not serve as a pretext for the development of more precarious employment. All workers should have access to equal treatment regardless of their employment contract. Such rights as access to social security and training and the right to join a trade union should never be denied to any worker.</p>

We should make all efforts to preserve as many jobs as possible, but these must be high quality jobs. At present, there is a huge increase in the numbers of people being employed on the basis of so-called atypical and highly atypical contracts across the European Union. These are contracts for periods of less than six months, with a work period shorter than 10 hours a week, or oral contracts. It is mostly young people up to 25 years of age, people approaching the age of retirement and, from a gender perspective, women, who are forced by economic and social circumstances to agree to work on the basis of such arrangements. We should also consider whether this is a sensible reaction to the market situation, and whether to clarify or restrict the possibility of concluding such contracts, while making all efforts to progress to higher quality jobs rather than holding up job numbers, if they are mostly of this value.

      <p sl="pt">In recent years, following the global economic crisis, unemployment in the EU has risen exponentially (around 10% at the end of 2009). With the current model proven to not work and to not be the most suitable for protecting employment, it is of fundamental importance that we find new ways to overcome the crisis and create a sustainable long-term employment policy. I therefore feel that the key is to invest in training workers, in specific skills for each person and in innovation. Inflexible models of labour law have proven to have failed. The example of the United States shows that flexibility is not synonymous with insecurity, but with a dynamic job market. The figures quoted in the report show this, when they tell us that only 10% of the cases of unemployment in the US last for more than a year, compared to 45% (!) in the EU. This, in my opinion, is what Europe should be looking to achieve with the EU concept of flexicurity. Atypical contracts (part time; shift, casual or temporary work; working from home; telecommuting; etc.) should not be looked at with mistrust simply because they are atypical . Society has evolved, the world has changed, and labour relations must necessarily accompany this change.</p>

More than a fifth of European workers change their job every year. In the EU, 45% of all periods of unemployment last more than a year, compared with approximately 10% in the US.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Council needs to take heed of this reality and to adopt concrete measures to protect quality, decent jobs and create sustainable job opportunities under the EU 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="pt">We voted against this report on atypical contracts, secure professional careers, flexicurity and new forms of social dialogue, given that, despite having some positive points, such as the incentive to change atypical forms of work into formal forms of work, in general, the report more than anything else promotes flexicurity. Many of the report’s articles are an example of this, namely, when it says that it:</p>
      <p sl="pt">‘Believes it essential that current thinking on flexicurity be updated at European level in the light of the present crisis, so as to help increase both productivity and the quality of jobs by guaranteeing security and the protection of employment and workers’ rights, [ …] allowing firms the organisational flexibility needed to create or reduce jobs in response to the changing needs of the market [ …].’</p>
      <p sl="pt">Well, what we know is that big business and governments at EU level have not sought ‘a fair and balanced implementation of flexicurity principles’ that ‘can help to make labour markets more robust in the event of structural changes’.

      <p sl="fr">The casualisation of contracts and employment is a consequence of policies which have opened up the markets to foreign competition. This opening up pushes down salary and employment levels, almost the last remaining adjustable variable for enterprises in a world of unfair competition. Current immigration policies in Europe also push down salaries and conditions of employment for the least-qualified workers, as very many statistical studies show. This is without taking into account their disproportionate costs in public finances, and thus their responsibility in deficits and public debts, as well as the fiscal drain on the European public.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, ignoring all that, the rapporteur persists in a general political logic which leads to insecurity, unemployment and an increase in the number of poor workers.

Against this background, there are two things that need to be taken into consideration: on the one hand, it must be possible to be flexible in the way employment relationships that do not fit into the conventional frameworks are structured. On the other hand, social security must be guaranteed for the workers in such ‘atypical’ forms of employment. I support the rapporteur’s proposals to step up efforts to create sustainable jobs as well as training and, at the same time, to assist the unemployed and those seeking jobs in their search by providing active counselling and to reintegrate them into the workplace.

Atypical employment contracts must remain the exception in Europe. The transition must be made to stable, protected, better quality employment contracts. The fast pace of structural change necessitates more flexible forms of working. However, atypical contracts must not become the norm if they are associated with poor social protection or even deliberate exploitation. The abuse of atypical employment breaches the European social model. This model varies in its application in Member States and forms the backbone of public support for responsible political action. There is no alternative option for protecting disadvantaged groups, not only during this European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion and not only during the crisis period after the crash in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">Participation, fair working conditions and the safeguarding of fundamental rights must be guaranteed to those who are disproportionately affected by atypical employment: women, the elderly and young people. Proactive measures must be adopted at national and European level to tackle this, such as a mass campaign against illicit employment, getting rid of precarious jobs and guaranteeing access to further training, qualifications and lifelong learning. The balance needs to be found between productivity, on the one hand, and protection for employee rights, on the other.</p>

Thus, I would ask the Commission and the national governments to abide by their responsibilities regarding the situation of ‘excluded’ people – workers on atypical or ‘very atypical’ contracts – and to find a balance between their rights and those of so-called ‘insiders’.

      <p sl="de">The incidence of atypical employment contracts is increasing significantly in the European Union. The analysis presented in the Gruny report is therefore good and to be welcomed. Culture, the media and new media in particular are sectors where there are hardly any normal contracts any more. For example, camera operators and technicians in film teams are described as being freelance, even though there is actually a degree of dependency. However, in light of this, the report fails to mention the political steps required to grant the relevant employees rights in their position, such as pension rights or rights to representation. We therefore go further in our alternative resolution. We call for the same rights to apply to all employment contracts and for this principle to be legally enshrined in the EU. There must not be two classes of employment contract. Those of us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also feel it is important to restrict the grey area concerning ‘false’ self-employment. Therefore, what we want to achieve is that, if an organisational and financial dependency exists, this employment relationship is recognised by the status of employee. This is the only way we can ensure that people who work their whole life can also enjoy their old age with dignity.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Nowadays, people work in all kinds of capacities: as employees or as (‘false’) self-employed workers, full-time or part-time, on fixed-term or open-ended contracts, as home workers or as temporary workers. The fact is that the flexibility required by employers is often at the expense of the necessary protection of workers. Today, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance tabled an alternative resolution that aimed to put the main focus on an unambiguous status of ‘worker’ (in whatever capacity) and pushed for a directive guaranteeing equal rights for all workers. That resolution did not make it, and Parliament passed up an opportunity to construct a stronger social Europe. Nevertheless, I have also supported the original resolution, as it pushes for an extension of worker protection and seeks to guarantee the fundamental rights of workers and a safe transition between jobs, and to strengthen the role of trade unions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, this approach is certainly useful, particularly bearing in mind that more and more people are employed on atypical contracts.

Action is certainly desirable, therefore, and so I welcome the position of the whole European Parliament.</p>

If we compare this report with the Commission communication based on the Commission’s Green Paper entitled ‘Modernising labour law’, improvements have been made in the course of the process. The report also emphasises a concern about the impact of the anti-trade union judgments on the labour market in Europe. This is important. In large countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, one in four jobs are currently in the low wage sector. Unemployment and social dumping in the EU’s internal market have put the trade unions and labour movements on the defensive. Nevertheless, I believe that the EU should not involve itself in the forms of employment. This is a matter that must instead be dealt with at a national level. In my home country, collective agreements to deal with these matters are negotiated by autonomous parties. The starting point must be the right to full time work as standard, but with the possibility of part time work.</p>

      <p sl="pt">A specific ruling for the management of bio-waste seems to me to be a basic corollary of the execution of the principles contained in the Framework Directive on Waste. A range of standards need to be compiled, practices harmonised and the internal market promoted through a synergy of environment, recycling and the creation of green jobs. An efficient Europe in terms of resources is not only a Europe 2020; it is a Europe of the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Efficient management of bio-waste not only brings environmental benefits but also contributes positively to the social and economic spheres. I am therefore voting in favour of this report’s proposals. The importance of improving efficiency in bio-waste management, as well as prioritising its prevention/reduction, will contribute to boosting sustainable development and management of natural resources. It is also important not to neglect the positive effects of improved management of bio-waste, namely, the impact on the functioning of the internal market, on the future of agriculture through preservation and recuperation of soil fertility and also on the promotion of renewable energy. Compiling the vast collection of legislation on bio-waste management into one piece of legislation should therefore be given priority, as should the necessary harmonisation of the Member States’ policies through a specific ruling on bio-waste.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Waste is, after power, industry and agriculture, the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, the main source of the emissions being landfills. Landfills represent an enormous threat, not only through the production of methane, but also through the possible contamination of underground water, soil and, of course, the surface of the landfill sites. Ever greater areas are experiencing irreparable soil degradation here. Globally, bio-waste is most often put in landfills and only a tiny percentage is sorted and reprocessed. Up to 100 million tonnes of kitchen waste and garden waste is produced in the European Union each year, and up to 37 million tonnes of waste from the food and drink industry. However, bio-waste has an important role to play in combating climate change and, if it could be exploited, represents enormous potential for producing renewable energy. Europeans now understand the need to sort waste. However, bio-waste almost always ends up in landfills.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In some of the older Member States, it is possible to store bio-waste in containers and to process and make further use of it. In the new Member States, there is almost no chance of separating bio-waste as well as plastic, glass and paper, because people have nowhere to store it. It is therefore essential to create conditions for the recycling and further energy generating use of bio-waste in every Member State of the EU. The report deals with the issue adequately, and I will vote in favour of its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is estimated that the amount of bio-waste produced in the EU every year is around 100 million tonnes. This type of waste is the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, especially when deposited in landfills. The resolution presented here seeks to encourage the diversion of bio-waste away from landfills, promote the production of high quality compost to restore soil without chemicals and to encourage the creation of renewable energy. To date, the European Commission has insisted on the lack of any need for a directive on this stream of waste.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I hope that the Commissioner responsible for the Environment Directorate-General reads the report, notes the position of the majority in Parliament, and stops having such a narrow-minded view of this matter.

      <p sl="pt">The management of bio-waste, absolutely necessary to the healthy existence of the human species, and to its harmonious coexistence with nature, must not be seen in the light of strictly commercial interests. The report under discussion refers to the ‘establishment of a mandatory separate collection system for the Member States’, and the suitable treatment of bio-waste through anaerobic digestion and composting. Although we broadly agree with these principles, we cannot, however, neglect to point out some problems. In addition to the technical difficulties inherent to the advocated treatment, which cannot be ignored, this is much more expensive. The question unanswered in the report is: who will pay?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report is lax regarding measures for the prevention of waste production, with the focus devoted almost exclusively to its recycling. Reduction is one of the best ways of combating problems related to waste. I refer to the possibility of domestic composting which would allow much of the bio-waste to bypass the general treatment system – an issue that is absent from the report. As regards composting, it is not enough to say that we need to do it. The conditions have to be created for its use, without restrictions and without technical or scientific foundations, which only favour the stronger competition from the fertiliser industry.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Bio-waste plays an important role in the fight against climate change and offers an interesting potential in terms of protecting soil and promoting the production of renewable energy. The Member States must take measures to promote the separate collection of bio-waste – for example, to produce compost. We need to have a real European compost market, because composting is the processing method best suited to green waste and has the advantage that it can be used for fertilising soil.</p>

Much of this biodegradable garden, cooking and food waste can and should be used as a source of renewable energy and in recycled materials.

Even though bio-waste treatment has already been widely discussed in the European institutions, one cannot but notice how much the situation has changed in the past few years. Whereas technological progress has to be included in the debates, no less than 11 new Member States have joined the EU along with Lithuania, all of them bringing specific waste management practices. While the annual amount of bio-waste in the EU is estimated at 76.5-102 Mt for food and garden waste and up to 37 Mt from the food and drink industry, I find it of utmost importance to pave the way for a debate on the possible need for future policy action. Improving bio-waste management and developing the use of bio-waste as a resource will result in considerable economic, social and environmental gains and help turn the EU into a resource efficient ‘recycling society’.</p>

      <p sl="it">Biodegradable waste – biodegradable garden, kitchen and food waste – accounts for around a third of urban waste and has a potentially significant environmental impact. When such waste is disposed of in landfills, it emits methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide and one of the main causes of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="it">While waste management in the European Union is governed by an extensive body of regulations, in the area of biodegradable waste, there is scope for further improvements, all the more so given that such waste can be recycled and used as a renewable energy source.</p>

      <p sl="ro">One strategic objective of waste management policy is to transform the EU into a recycling society. The enormous quantity of waste produced every year in the EU (estimated at between 76.5 and 102 million tonnes of bio-waste, including approximately 8 million tonnes in Romania) cannot be squandered. Bio-waste plays an important part in combating climate change (in 2004, a total of 109 million tonnes of greenhouse gases were released in the waste sector), offering valuable potential in terms of protecting the soil and promoting the production of renewable energies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This means that sustainable development can be promoted through efficient resource management. This entails the proper management of bio-waste in accordance with standard EU regulations, the promotion of technological innovations and the creation of green jobs (for example, the recycling industry creates up to 250 jobs for every 10 000 tonnes of waste which is recycled).</p>
      <p sl="ro">Consequently, a compulsory separate collection system, bio-waste recycling, a specific bio-waste directive, the promotion of research and innovation and raising citizens’ awareness about measures preventing the accumulation of waste are necessary to help the economy and the environment, as well as help achieve the EU 2020 strategy objectives.</p>

The report gives priority to ‘energy recovery’ from urban bio-waste through ‘anaerobic’ digestion for the production of bio-gas and considers incineration to be a ‘viable alternative’, even though it is a known fact that these have an adverse impact in terms of environmental pollution and damage and zero benefits. At the same time, it downgrades to second place aerobic processing, which is a mild, simple, tested and safe technology which produces a stable, high quality product at a much lower cost. That is because it does not guarantee large profits for capital, nor does it link up with the other equally environmentally destructive euro-unifying policies to promote the incineration of biomass and biofuels.

In this way, the European Parliament is reiterating the request it made during the revision of the Community legislation on waste in 2008.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic governance constitutes a crucial challenge for the future of our Union. When, in 1993, President Delors made clear the need for a deeper coordination of economic policies, many Member States rejected this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, when the first Commission – which I had the honour of presiding over – brought up this question in its report on the tenth anniversary of economic and monetary union, in 2008, not many people listened. I nevertheless emphasised the need to provide an adequate response to the question of economic governance in my guidelines for the present term, which we discussed together about a year ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner Olli Rehn then discussed this with you during his hearing. By that time, the Commission had already announced its intention to put forward proposals to strengthen economic governance in the European Union, particularly in the euro area. Unfortunately, the crisis has shown that we were right. However, the urgency of this debate is now recognised, and I can only welcome the fact that the conditions have finally come together for advancing towards a true European economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a result, the Commission provided detailed proposals on 12 May. These proposals have kept the debate alive, including with the European Parliament, and particularly the work of the task force presided over by the President of the European Council. The Commission is pleased with the progress of this work and with the consensus achieved up to now, which was shown very clearly during the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to maintain this dynamic, last Wednesday, the Commission again adopted a range of proposals which, once converted into legislative initiatives, will be able to be implemented from 2011 if they are adopted in good time. These proposals do not involve changing the treaty. We must act now, within the legal context that we have today. This is not a limitation. The new possibilities that the Treaty of Lisbon offers us can and must be fully utilised, because we no longer have the time to wait. Our citizens, our businesses and our economy are demanding that we take initiatives. It is our responsibility to decide and to act now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Because of the economic crisis, the European Union has been faced with a series of serious tests. The reinforcement of economic governance is, of course, just one aspect of the European Union response to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The response has also included other dimensions: the comprehensive reform of the regulation of financial markets and proposals for a new European supervisory architecture. As I said this morning, a deal is within reach in the coming days. I call on all parties to maintain the positive dynamic, to ensure that new authorities can start their work in early 2011. This will also keep Europe in the lead in implementing our G20 commitments in this area: the measures to secure financial stability, first through the Greece Programme and then through the mechanisms for the euro area as a whole and, last but not least, a programme for growth and jobs through structural reforms included in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our response to the crisis is a holistic one. We stabilise, we consolidate and we modernise. We prepare our social market economy to ensure a better future for our citizens. But for now, let me focus on governance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The challenge of the past few months has centred on whether our economic governance is equal to the new pressures placed on our economic and fiscal stability. We have the treaty provisions in place which allow us to act. We have the institutions. We need to make it work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We faced a real risk and we successfully resisted it. Now we are filling in the gaps we have identified to pre-empt such risks for the future. I first announced to Parliament the ideas we fleshed out in the Commission communication of 12 May. Our debates since then are reflected in the Commission communication of 30 June. Now we are moving on to the operational phase, with the Commission ready to submit legislative proposals as early as September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Before explaining the issues in detail, I would like to emphasise how much this process has benefited from the work with the European Council, the task force chaired by the President of the European Council, and indeed the deliberations of Parliament. This work has helped to build a real European momentum. I hope that this will translate later into a swift consideration and swift adoption of legislative proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our approach to economic governance is to have rules that are more comprehensive and more efficient. The current treaty gives us plenty of scope to do this and I am convinced that the Community method will once again give us the right answer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need a stronger surveillance regime. That means one that is stricter and broader, covering budgetary, macro-economic and structural policies, a regime that acknowledges the reality that every Member State has its own particularities but a regime that also reflects the interdependence we all know is central to the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What does this mean in detail? First, we need more coordination. Key to this is the ‘European semester’. It will enhance economic transparency and encourage peer reviews, ex ante, among Member States. If Member States submit their stability and convergence programmes and their national reform programmes simultaneously, we will have a truly joined-up approach. This European perspective will be an asset for Member States as they plan, discuss and adopt their national budgets according to their national constitutional procedures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second, we need the credibility that comes with better enforcement. This means a refined incentives and sanctions toolbox, a more effective mix of both preventive and corrective action. We need a Stability and Growth Pact that is targeted, not only regarding the deficit criterion but also on debt: a pact that has real teeth and is respected. Of course, the most effective sanctions are those that do not need to be used because they create the incentive to comply – but, in order to achieve this, the rules need to be strong enough to command this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to be very clear on this. Without a more stringent system of incentives and sanctions, we will not reinforce economic governance in a credible way. If a Member State does not respect the commonly agreed rules, then it must be prepared to suffer the consequences. This means also that sanctions must be designed so as to apply to all Member States on an equal basis. Parliament can be reassured that the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that this will be the case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards financial sanctions, we proposed to base them on a broader range of expenditure from the EU budget than before. In a nutshell, all Member States should, in future, face the risk of losing money from the EU budget in the event of persistent failure to comply with the fiscal rules. The application of these rules should also be quasi-automatic as regards the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The timing of measures is also key. We must not fall into the trap of waiting too long before sanctions kick in. Incentives and sanctions must be brought upstream so that action is deployed before the situation gets out of hand. Preventive action can be much more effective than corrective action – but it requires discipline and political will.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the weakest points of our current rules is the absence of mechanisms to deal with problems appearing in so-called ‘good times’. We are addressing this in our proposals, in particular, as regards the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Third, our surveillance needs to capture all the key elements. It must not be restricted to fiscal policy alone. We have seen that such a narrow perspective does not work. We must have tools to detect macro-economic imbalances among Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Such imbalances weaken the cohesion of the EU and, in particular, of the euro area. A comprehensive scoreboard of indicators will give us what we need to identify increasing divergences and to propose remedies. They need, of course, to be complemented by appropriate enforcement mechanisms for such remedies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourth, as well as stricter fiscal rules, we also need to push the structural reforms, innovation and trade that will put Europe back on track in terms of growth and create jobs for the future. That is what our Europe 2020 strategy is all about. The European Council endorsed it a fortnight ago. Now we need to put it into practice to ensure that national and European policies are fully in tune, creating the virtuous cycle where growth in one part of Europe helps drive growth in another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fifth, let me repeat the utmost importance of transparent and robust financial market regulation, and call on all actors in the process to adopt the necessary reforms as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to underline the historic dimension of the reforms we are putting forward. They constitute an answer to the challenges that our single currency is facing in Europe, but they also have an important impact in the global financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The time has come to give the Economic and Monetary Union the tools it needs to fully function, in order to ensure its credibility. What is at stake is not just some technical rules. What is at stake is the future of the euro and we can say, to some extent, it is the future of our European project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To make all this possible, we have to show without any possible doubts that the world has changed and that our proposals on economic governance are not more of the same, but the real breakthrough. Today, the conditions have been met to bring together the Stability and Growth Pact, economic governance and the structural reforms in a consistent system within the Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This system should harness all our tools for the common objective: the Structural Funds, budget surveillance and the reforms provided for in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a strategy for the whole Union. This is not just an addition of different strategies. It is a real economic strategy for Europe, but we can only have a European economic strategy if we have a truly economic system of governance. However, the system of incentives and sanctions should reflect the special responsibilities of Member States that have already adopted the single currency, in strict compliance with the legal framework. Those Member States share a common good called the euro and it would not be acceptable for the misbehaviour of some members to put all the others at risk.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am convinced that these proposals will mean a step change in the economic consistency of the Union, while at the same time preserving the inevitable specificities between those Member States who are members of the euro area and, of course, respecting those who are not yet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The current situation requires ambition and boldness: the proposals of the Commission will send out a strong message, both inside the EU and worldwide, that the European Union is equal to the task. It is therefore paramount that our three institutions work consistently and in a spirit of close cooperation to finalise and approve these proposals with mutual confidence and belief in our common future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important that all our partners worldwide understand that we are ready to do whatever it takes to defend the euro and the stability of our common currency. The Commission’s task is to use its right of initiative to further the common interest of Europe and its citizens. It is determined to fulfil this task and is convinced that these proposals are the right way forward for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn, your proposals are an important step towards strengthening economic governance in Europe. I should like to pay tribute to you for actively exercising your right of initiative rather than waiting to see what the Council’s task force comes up with. Our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), welcomes the proposals and wishes to cooperate closely and energetically with you and the Council to accomplish them. It also wishes to cooperate on taking the next step towards the Community method. What is needed is not new institutions but instead a strong, independent role for the European Commission, and a European Council that commits itself to a common approach and democratic control by the European Parliament. As far as the PPE Group is concerned, these are the ingredients for the legislative proposals you are to present to us in early September.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We have great expectations of the European Semester and the coordination of national action programmes. Important reforms and painful measures in the Member States are necessary in order to strengthen their competitiveness. This will create jobs and prosperity for our citizens. We also have great expectations of the measures to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact using a big stick: sanctions, that is. You called the series of measures a ‘toolbox’. A great deal will depend on the specific contents of this toolbox.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One of our Dutch football teams has the motto ‘deeds not words’. Deeds not words is exactly what Parliament wants when it comes to strengthening economic governance, and also when it comes to the legislation on European supervision of the financial institutions. The Council embraced the report by Jacques de Larosière, but this must now be put into practice, transposed into legislation – supervisory authorities with real powers that can start work on 1 January – and so the Council now needs to actually do this. Parliament will be voting tomorrow, but we shall leave the door open for the Council to conclude an agreement during the meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council this month. This means endorsing Parliament’s position on the powers for this new supervisory authority, as Parliament will stand firm – not in its own interests but in those of the public – in order to restore calm to the financial markets, so that we can once more look to the future with confidence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we worry that President Barroso and Commissioner Rehn’s proposals lack balance. Fiscal stability cannot exist in isolation from strong economic growth and high levels of employment. Current and further planned austerity measures will lead to a sustained period of low growth, increasing unemployment and further social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Barroso, I know that you do not believe that millions more unemployed and more social exclusion are an acceptable price to pay for rapid fiscal consolidation, but that seems to be the path you are treading. In your proposals of last week, I think you are missing the point. There is a need for a qualitative leap in European economic policy and in its governance, but that should lead to a balanced policy agenda combining fiscal responsibility with economic effectiveness and social fairness. You have left out several highly relevant options that would really mean a qualitative leap in this field. Real economic policy coordination should provide for a more differentiated consolidation plan for Europe, instead of the short-sighted ‘one size fits all’ austerity agenda that makes no economic sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, you must come forward with an economic policy agenda for jobs and fiscal consolidation. Today, we only have an agenda for cutting deficits at the expense of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, we need strong proposals on how to safeguard proper public financing for the recently agreed Europe 2020 strategy, including new tax revenues from financial transaction taxes and other sources. We also urgently need operational proposals from you, the Commission, on how to shift the tax burden away from labour as rapidly as possible. Taxation on labour is far too high in a number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, you have stopped short of positive incentives, rather than negative sanctions, in a renewed Stability and Growth Pact, although that could be a very promising path to tread. I hope you will reconsider and come forward with a more balanced set of proposals in the autumn.</p>

    <intervention id="2-362" speaker_id="97058" name="Guy Verhofstadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am satisfied with the presentation of the package by the President of the Commission and, if I may give my opinion, I would suggest that you bring it in as soon as possible on the basis of your right of initiative. Put it on the table of the Council and put it to the European Parliament, because that is the mechanism by which the Union operates. The Commission has the initiative here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would thus like to wish the newly-introduced working group much success, but ultimately, the Commission will have to abide by its responsibilities and put a proposal to the various institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, Mr President, some questions remain concerning this package.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first question, which is fundamental, is: who will manage this economic governance? Will it be the Member States, the Council or the Community institutions – that is, the European Central Bank and the European Commission? For the European Parliament, it is very clear: it has to be the Community authorities, because I have never seen the Member States demonstrate an ability to exercise this control themselves. This does not work: it has never worked in the past, and it will not work in the future either.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I agree that penalties should be envisaged, but not only concerning the Stability Pact, because, as you have said, this is only one aspect of the policy. We must also do this, for example, with regard to competitiveness, structural reforms and the European economy. There must be penalties, and on this point, I would ask certain Member States to show more consistency. They defend – even demand – penalties relating to the Stability Pact, but when we talk of penalties with regard to Europe 2020, from the competitiveness perspective, they are much more reticent. It must be one thing or the other. If we want penalties, they must be applied across the board.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My third comment is that we must also think, President of the Commission, of a strategy for economic growth. We cannot just say that we will reduce the deficits. It is necessary to make this reduction – and as a former budget minister, I want to reduce deficits – but apart from that, we also need an economic growth policy, and the only authority that can provide that is the European Union. The Union has borrowing capacity, and it has projects for the pan-European infrastructure that we need, as Mr Monti’s report emphasises, and the Commission must therefore make proposals in this direction too. It must do this not only with a view to reducing the deficits – which is necessary because the Stability Pact requires it – but also with a view to developing a credible economic growth strategy so that we do not fall into the trap of economic stagnation of the Japanese type, such as the one that we experienced for more than ten years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth element is the ‘stress tests’. I am satisfied with the fact that the decision has been taken to publish these. We already needed to do this a year ago, as the Americans did, because it is the only way of reopening the supply of credit in the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally – and I will stop there, Mr President – as regards financial supervision, let us be very clear on this point: there will not be any agreement with Parliament if the Council and the Member States do not respect the fact that in case of conflict, it is the European authority that has the last word. This is a crucial point. Furthermore, this element is repeated in the Commission’s proposals. This is the point of departure for the Larosière exercise. The Member States have not yet understood. It is time, Mr President, that the Member States accepted this, otherwise there will be no agreement on financial supervision.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-363" speaker_id="96730" name="Sven Giegold" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, many thanks for making this statement. I feel that we ought to be very careful not to continue falling back into old ways in a very difficult situation. What I mean by ‘old ways’ is the right-wing political groups stressing budget deficits and competitiveness problems, while the left-wing groups go on about the risks of austerity measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as I see it, we will not make any progress this way. On the other hand, if you take a fair look at this proposal, you have to admit that it contains signs of significant progress, for instance, with regard to budget coordination. It also specifically mentions imbalances. Until recently, it was still almost impossible to talk about imbalances seriously. The fact that sanctions should be applied if Member States fail to do their homework is also a sign of progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this proposal also has blind spots, which is something that we can no longer expect ourselves and our citizens to accept. This obviously means economic governance and also talking about tax issues. The fact is that we have tax havens, large areas of the economy which go untaxed, not to mention excessive tax competition. These must stop being taboo subjects and obviously have a place in such a statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it is not enough to coordinate budget policy only in the way it was described. We must ensure that budget policy is anti-cyclical, enabling it therefore to counteract crises. Unfortunately, this does not feature in the text. Furthermore, it is evidently still taboo to say that in the case of imbalances, there are countries in deficit and those in surplus, with both sides making their specific contributions. Unfortunately, you are still lacking the courage to explain things as clearly as is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have problems with asset prices and bubbles. This is not mentioned explicitly either. The point I am making is that we should at least be honest and put aside our ideological differences after this crisis for a time and take a look at all the causes of the crisis, instead of looking for these problems from a one-sided perspective. It is no longer enough now to make progress in this crisis. Our citizens are expecting holistic, comprehensive solutions, which is no more than they deserve.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, economic governance, supervisory architecture, cross-border crisis-management tools: these are all very important areas post financial crisis. For all these areas, we need to ensure that a strong and resilient structure is put in place as soon as possible in order to ensure that we can deliver a common set of rules, whether for Member States accounts and their behaviour in economic governance, or for our financial services reform. We need to arrive at consensus. The outcome needs to be fully implemented by all 27 Member States and be fully complied with. Any new institutions need to be apolitical, and recruitment of staff should be based, above all else, on merit and ability to do the task at hand. We need to send a clear signal that these new procedures and supervisory authorities, especially the proposed European Systemic Risk Board, are necessary and can work for the benefit of our constituents and our collective economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent financial and economic crisis has necessitated bold measures. In Europe, we have identified areas in which regulatory gaps can be bridged and will hopefully also improve the transparency of our markets and financial services as a whole. The recent agreement on the US finance bill has been hailed by many as putting the US regulatory reform ahead of the EU. I do not agree with this conclusion. If we can find agreement on the supervisory architecture over the coming days and weeks, we will have a robust EU framework centred on a new European Systemic Risk Board and the three Lamfalussy committees transformed into European authorities. Once this framework has been established, it should aid the safety of the financial system and may even prove to be a vehicle to improve the functioning of the single market in financial services.</p>
      <p sl="en">In following this agenda, we do, however, need to ensure that any new authorities established work effectively with national supervisory bodies and that, at all times, these discussions and negotiations strive for the best structure, the best supervision and the best outcome, rather than whether it is ‘more’ or ‘less Europe’. I commend the Commission’s focus in addressing the key issues of concern and believe that although by very different methods, we will soon end up with a global financial system which is safer and better serves our economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the wake of the measures proposed by the Commission in recent weeks for averting imminent crises, involving the euro rescue package and the Europe 2020 strategy, which entail rescuing the banks, on the one hand, and cuts in social security, salaries and pensions, on the other, we now have proposals on the table for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. In our view, these proposals from the Commission on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact are taking the wrong tack.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission, following in the footsteps of the working group headed by President Van Rompuy, does not want to modify the Pact’s content, but instead wants to tighten the sanctions and enforce compliance. Both the Commission and Council are calling for further controls and penalties for Member States in deficit. This has not worked in the past and will not work in the future. However, we in the European Parliament’s Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left are pleased, at any rate, that the harshest penalties proposed by the Commission for countries in deficit were not applied.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regulation of the financial markets is a matter of urgency. We will do our part to resolve the situation. Europe’s citizens already have to pay; the Council now ought finally to swing into action as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problems with the Stability and Growth Packet are not down to lack of compliance or the rapid reduction of the annual deficit to the Maastricht target of 3% of new debt. This may stall growth in the euro area, which is still feeble and at risk.</p>
      <p sl="de">The current economic imbalances in the EU must be eliminated, as this is what speculators are making their living from. One of the ways to do this is for the countries with strong economies to drop their aggressive export strategies which have devastating consequences for the other countries. These countries must make greater efforts to strengthen their domestic markets and boost demand instead. Criteria such as the unemployment rate and the prevalence of poverty must be included in the Stability and Growth Pact. What is needed is to carry out a fundamental overhaul rather than tighten its conditions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioners – the three amigos if I may call you such – last session, Mr President, you had to scamper away. I think you had an urgent appointment. You missed my words of wisdom and I am glad to see that you are here to receive them today because I feel I have some wisdom to offer.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are in such a pickle actually, are you not? One could almost feel sorry for you but of course, you know, you bring some of this on yourselves. The common currency experiment – which is an experiment that was doomed to failure; I remember lecturing at Cambridge University back in the 1990s, explaining why it was deeply flawed and could not work and I gave it about 10 years and I am afraid it looks as though I was right – was flawed even by your own rule book. What in fact happened when you introduced it was that you actually tore up your own rule book. You threw it away! You welcomed every fiscal dysfunctional economy into the eurozone, including Greece – which was going to hasten the demise of the eurozone, and it thus comes as no surprise. I am not a johnny-come-lately to the demise of the euro. It was always written in the runes, as it were. To suggest now that we have only just found out that Greece was broke is intellectually dishonest. I was in the City at the time and we were buying Greek bonds at 10% coupons, they fell to five and it was a one-way bet – a bit like having the winner of the horse before the race had even started!</p>
      <p sl="en">Our commercial banks have got themselves into a terrible problem because they buy junk debt. They redistributed junk debt repackaged at triple A ratings. What are our central banks doing now? The very same thing. They are buying in the secondary market and buying junk bonds, repackaging them as triple A. This is just how we got into this pickle to start with. If you want to get out of this mess, you need to get rid of the political-establishment support for commercial banks and get rid of central banks, which are actually part of the problem, not the solution.</p>

    <intervention id="2-367" speaker_id="28210" name="Marine Le Pen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the Europe of the euro area is experiencing an economic decline without precedent in its history, the weakest growth in the world, the highest unemployment, and a continuing decline in competitiveness. This total failure was made manifest to everyone during the recent sovereign debt crisis which affected Greece, and which will continue to affect Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, resulting in the general impoverishment of the populations of these countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You had promised the convergence and the harmonisation of the European countries. Today, you are rushing us towards a social and political explosion. You alone bear the responsibility for this current tragedy, because by imposing a policy of a single, uniform and totalitarian monetary policy on economies which are so divergent, you have encouraged frenzied speculation among some people and economic sluggishness among others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can we explain the fact that Spain, which had a budget surplus of 2% in 2007, is today experiencing a deficit of 12%, if it is not because the single and uniform interest rates of the ECB have encouraged unprecedented real estate speculation in this country, which today is covered with empty houses? The entirety of the European banking sector is effectively contaminated by this new sub-prime crisis, the consequences of which are causing great fear.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Your only response is to propose that we persevere in this error, though you have been wrong on everything, by continuing the takeover by the European Union and increasing its powers through upstream control of the national budgets, and by imposing on the European people an unprecedented austerity policy. Errare humanum est, perseverare diabolicum – to err is human, to persist is of the Devil.</p>

    <intervention id="2-368" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will try to respond to some of the concrete questions. First of all, to Corien Wortmann-Kool, thank you for your support. In fact, we believe this will enhance the credibility of our Stability and Growth Pact, but also of the euro and of the European project as a whole, and we believe that Parliament should be closely associated with all these efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the last European Council, when President Buzek was there, I made a point that Parliament should be kept fully informed of progress in the discussions on the future economic governance of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that some of the concerns expressed by Mr Hughes and Mr Bisky should be considered, but in fact, I believe that our proposal does consider your concerns because in this proposal, we are saying something new: that the Stability and Growth Pact is not everything, that we are linking analysis of the implementation of the measures in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact with macro-economic imbalances, with the problems of divergences in competitiveness. So, in fact, what we are proposing is a holistic approach that does not look only to the macro-economic aspects but also to growth, as Guy Verhofstadt was suggesting, that looks also to innovation, to the reforms. That is precisely our goal with Youth 2020. And yes, Mr Verhofstadt, as you rightly mention, we are concerned now with the internal market and we are working on this taking the report presented by Mario Monti – a report I have asked him to present – as a basis and Commissioner Barnier will come in the Fall with some very important proposals, a Single Market Act in fact to address this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">So our proposal is not only about prudence in macro-economic aspects. Today we are discussing economic governance, so it is natural that we look at what did not go well, but I want to underline this point – this is not just about macro-economic prudence: it is also about growth and about our reform agenda. What is new here is that now, for the first time – if, of course, this plan can in the end be agreed – we have this comprehensive approach, trying to look at all the aspects. You will remember that, when I presented the Europe 2020 strategy some months ago, in some quarters in Europe some people were saying ‘No, you cannot link it to the Stability and Growth Pact because it may weaken the Stability and Growth Pact’. I think that everybody agrees now that discussing the macro-economic constraints without discussing structural reform, and without considering competitiveness, makes no sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I also do not agree with the idea that our approach is not balanced. In Youth 2020, we were fighting for targets such as reduction of poverty, education, and employment to be included. So it is, in fact, a very balanced approach, one in which we try to combine all the economic policy instruments, to have a European dimension and a national dimension and to have, at the same time, objectives related to competitiveness and objectives related to social inclusion and to education.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are right, Mr Verhofstadt; it is up to the Commission to make the proposals, and that is what we are doing. We will come with formal proposals. What is going on is a very important reform. That is why Olli Rehn is also giving his very important input on behalf of the Commission to the task force. We believe it is important to bring some consensus, because these are very important changes, but of course, when the time comes to present the legislative proposals to the Commission, we will do so, and that is exactly the best way to have your Parliament associated.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we also want to include in this holistic approach macro-economic surveillance with TIF. It is not only about sanctions for those who do not fulfil the criteria of depth and the deficit. We will also try to reinforce coordination in terms of the macro-economic imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you also mentioned supervision, and, once again, I would like to remind you that our aim remains to have the new authority in place at the start of 2011. We need this since our whole reform is based on this new architecture. In the last few days, a new Belgian Presidency has renewed momentum towards a deal. There is a predominant sense of constructive pragmatism on both sides. I am grateful for the ambition Parliament has been demonstrating. I am grateful for your strong support. At the same time, I would like to ask you to continue your efforts to reach a satisfactory deal in the next few days. I believe it now appears within grasp. The Commission has contributed through various compromise texts and is very pleased that progress is being made. We now call on both colegislators to maintain the positive dynamic. As Mrs Swinburne said, and she is right, the Americans have announced the political agreement but they have not yet legislated. Sometimes when you read the press, it appears that the Americans are much more advanced than we are. It is not true. President Obama said in the G20 that he got a bipartisan agreement. Great, and we welcome that. But in reality, we should be able to conclude our legislative work long before our American partners and I believe we should do that to show also our leadership in terms of the financial regulation and supervision at the global level. That could only enhance the role of Europe in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, some of you spoke about stress testing. As you know, the Commission is playing an important role in promoting transparency and communicating the results of the ongoing stress testing of banks. At the last European Council, I made a strong plea to make the results public. As you know, this is a national competence, but I am indeed extremely pleased with the European Council agreement to do so. This decision should reassure investors by either lifting unfounded suspicion or by dealing with the remaining problems that may exist. I am very confident about the overall resilience of the EU banking industry, but we must identify possible pockets of vulnerability and deal with them. A fully transparent stress test provides the opportunity to do so. Backstop mechanisms must be designed for activation in case of need and this is, once again, a national responsibility. If state intervention is needed, this will be examined by the Commission in a timely manner under the Community State aid rules. The European decision to publish individual results of bank stress tests was indeed very well received by the G20 leaders in Toronto last weekend and we believe this is the way to restore confidence in our overall system.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, as you see, we are acting on several fronts. Today, I have presented to you the proposals made more recently in terms of economic governance, but we should not separate those proposals from the other efforts that we are pursuing to give more coherence to our economic policy, to understand that a monetary union without some kind of economic coordination does not make sense. I believe that the stability of the euro is in the interest of all our citizens. It is in the interest, certainly, of the euro area, but it is also in the interest of all the European Union and of all those who want open markets, open economies and open societies.</p>

Europe is about mutual and close interdependency. The current crisis demonstrates how important it is to know more about the challenges and worries the other members experience and to be prepared for common actions. The proposed coordination and control mechanisms are needed, taking into account both the European dimension and specific realities of each Member State. However, control mechanisms are not a solution but just a means. They should not be overestimated. The solution is in more efficient work, entrepreneurship and innovation. The key to the solution is prevention. Special attention should be paid to budgetary frameworks and the state debts. Instead of breaking financial control into smaller clusters, monitoring of the macro-economic situation as a whole is needed. The new dual system of incentives and sanctions deserves support. I also encourage making better use of Eurostat. Reliable and timely data is a crucial component to making the right decisions. I encourage the Council to show political will on the measures proposed, so that we can proceed to the practical implementation phase.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I should like to draw fellow Members’ attention to the problem of national budgeting. The tax system cannot serve solely as a means of collecting revenue; it must also regulate and optimise economic development and guarantee the social protection of the population. The tax system in Latvia is targeted at one result only – how to collect revenue today by any means possible. It seems that the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Latvia has no care for what will happen tomorrow. The programme being followed by the Latvian Government could, in a year’s time, lead to a situation in which the number of taxpayers will be drastically reduced and the level of unemployment will significantly increase, resulting in enormous social costs. This is all the result of illogical and unclear tax legislation. In individual cases, tax authority personnel can apply this ‘turbid’ legislation in any way they choose. This has led to the bankruptcy of many businesses and commercial structures. We must urgently set up a committee, a group of experts, charged with an evaluation of the Latvian tax system. What is happening in the tax sphere in Latvia today can be described in one word – illegality! In essence, the state is depriving entrepreneurs of their liquid funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at the origin of this financial crisis are the national supervisors. Our financial markets are integrated at a European level and in every country the main financial institutions are cross-border institutions, but financial supervision has remained only at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this stage, and with the huge crisis we are suffering, there are only two possibilities. We can reinforce the national supervisors or we can create European supervisors in order to adapt European financial supervision to the globalisation process. In this report, I propose a closer link between the European Central Bank and the European Systemic Risk Board. The President of the ECB will also be the Chair of the ESRB and represent the ESRB externally.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my opinion, the European Central Bank has gained credibility and has become an institution of worldwide renown in this financial crisis. It has been recognised all over the world, including by some Anglo-Saxon experts, such as David Marsh, the Chairman of the London and Oxford Group. In my opinion, the European Central Bank is the only European independent institution that will have the moral and material authority to play an important role in future European supervision of both financial markets and financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">To justify why a closer link between the ECB and the ESRB is needed, we can see what is happening in other countries outside the eurozone. Three weeks ago, it was my pleasure to read in the Financial Times that Mr George Osborne, the UK Conservative Finance Minister, has decided the biggest overhaul of City regulation since 1997. The UK splits the main financial regulator and gives more power and more clout to the Bank of England. In the same direction that we are now proposing, the UK has abolished the English tripartite structure, formed by the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury. Mr Osborne said that it had failed to prevent the crisis because no one knew who was in charge. Mr Osborne will hand the Bank of England full control for monitoring systemic risk in the economy as well as oversight of individual banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I completely agree with Mr Osborne when he argues that nowadays, only independent central banks have the broad macro-economic understanding, the authority and the knowledge required to make the kind of macro-prudential judgments that are required.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report was voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with a large cross-party majority, so I believe that, with these arguments, the UK Conservatives will also vote in favour of my proposal at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">To close my speech, this is not time for a debate on a second order reform. I know that state nationalism is now rising in the EU and I know that there is no consensus for such sweeping reform, but this is our choice – jumping to a political and economic union or reverting to our insolvent nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that, in my opinion, only a closer and stronger union can save the eurozone.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the financial supervision package is one of the most important legislative measures that has come before the European Parliament, and is a decisive step towards improving the economic governance of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Work on it, which began formally in September 2009 with the presentation by the Commission of the legislative proposals that followed the report by the de Larosière Group, has deeper roots in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would point, in particular, to the work of all of the Members who, for years, have advocated European financial supervision and, in particular, those who represent my group.</p>
      <p sl="es">When the Council adopted its position under the Swedish Presidency, in December of last year, the main parliamentary groups held it to be insufficient for addressing the deficiencies detected. The rapporteurs were subsequently able to reach a broad agreement in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which was put to the vote on 10 May of this year.</p>
      <p sl="es">The trialogues began the following day. A marathon series of meetings has taken place since then: 18 under the Spanish Presidency and two under the Belgian Presidency. There has been very significant progress on fundamental issues which are already important bases for the agreement: the definition of objectives; consumer protection; the role of the authorities within the regulatory process; the checking of compliance with legal standards; the establishment of binding mediation; the temporary banning of products; the introduction of the notion of systemic risk and the strengthening of supervision relating to it; the development of the concept of the ‘stakeholder’; proper use of the safeguard clause; the authorities’ voting system, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">When including this item in this plenary sitting, we had anticipated completing the negotiating process by this date. We wanted to send a positive signal to the public and to the financial markets, declare our commitment to the authorities being in operation by 1 January of next year, and associate ourselves with the arguments of the European Council in favour of a speedy conclusion to the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have been open up to the last minute to reaching a compromise, but the technical, legal and political complexity of the proceedings has not allowed us to arrive at a final text.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, the new Presidency of the Council has expressly requested time to bring its positions into line with the prospect of an agreement upon a first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">As colegislators, we need to continue making an effort, as this agreement is still possible. We rapporteurs have therefore decided to vote for the text that reflects our commitment, endorsing the ambitious mandate of the Parliament, but not to put the legislative resolution to the vote. This leaves some leeway for reaching a compromise at a first reading within the next few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="es">The ‘Omnibus’ Directive, for which I am rapporteur, introduces the new supervision architecture into 11 sectoral Union legislation directives relating to banking and securities markets. It is not a case, therefore, of a regular, generalised review. There is a great parliamentary consensus on doing this by preserving the acquis communautaire , adapting the comitology procedure to the Treaty of Lisbon, and updating the Lamfalussy architecture within the context of financial services.</p>
      <p sl="es">Financial supervision must be based on the existence of a set of standards, a ‘single rule book’ at European level, and to achieve this, a key role for the authorities in drawing up technical, or even regulatory, standards, by means of delegated acts or implementation measures, has been acknowledged throughout all of the sectoral legislation, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. The Commission has been given the necessary powers to ensure its adoption within the anticipated timeframe. All competences and powers have been incorporated into the sectoral legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the negotiations on this directive can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that it is nothing short of symbolic that the Council’s seat is empty just when we are coming on to this item. I am aware that the Council is currently attending the swearing-in ceremony, giving it a good excuse for its absence. However, the Council’s empty seat is indicative of the fact that now, after very many weeks and 18 trialogues on the core packages, which are the ESRB and the individual supervisory authorities, we have still not received any written common position from the Council in which it expresses its response to what we have done as a parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament has the following message, which is supported by a large, overall majority. We will not allow the Council to water down the proposals made by the de Larosière group and those submitted by the Commission itself into a nationally prejudiced, parochial approach, by not responding to the experiences from this crisis, but engaging instead in narrow-minded bickering over powers, without seeing which solutions were effective and what form financial supervision must take in a European internal market, but rather by ensuring that it did not give up any of its powers which, as has been very apparent in recent years, have not been exercised effectively at all because Europe’s financial centres have been competing with each other to make the best offers and people were happy to turn a blind eye occasionally to what was going on.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since then, we have had a wide-ranging discussion about many issues. Europe’s citizens do not understand why a common European Financial Supervisory Authority is going to be spread across three different cities. They also would have expected these authorities to be granted strong investor and consumer protection rights. This is the decision we have come to now in Parliament. There also seems, fortunately, to be a broad consensus that this step is necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">The regulation of derivatives will create new European market infrastructures. It should be the norm for public goods in Europe to come under European scrutiny as well, and not just from national state institutions. We also insisted in Parliament on the new authorities receiving rights allowing them to ban risky financial products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me spell it out: the aim is not to stop the introduction of innovative products on the financial markets. If things turn out to be risky, however, there should be an opportunity to ban these products throughout Europe. This principle is now accepted in the negotiations, but while the details are being ironed out, attempts are being made to make it so difficult to ban products that it is hardly likely to be applied in practice, and at least not to innovative financial products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then we have the long debate about direct decision rights. This was another case where we had to fight against the suggestions being watered down. The key point remains: if a real financial crisis breaks out, who declares the emergency? The Council insists that it should be the Council itself which should decide that decision rights should be transferred from Member States to a European authority. Will the Council ever do this? It is insisting that the fox should be put in charge of the henhouse. This does not make any sense, a fact which the Commission has also continually pointed out. So far, the Council appears inflexible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council also insists that any decisions made by the European authorities at the time when they are curtailing Member States’ budget rights can be reversed. We are happy to accept this principle, except for small amounts and not if it involves, for instance, reducing tax revenues. It must be a case of large sums being allocated by means of a decision at European level.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other words, in spite of negotiations lasting months and 18 trialogues, we are still not close to finalising everything. It is now over to the Council. We must now vote on this matter this week and send out a clear message to ensure that the Council finally heeds our citizens’ calls and establishes an efficient, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority, capable of providing an adequate response to the crisis. On that note, I am sure that we will continue our constructive cooperation in this House, and I am obliged to all my fellow Members for this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, with the Presidency absent, I believe that at this stage, we must look at where we are coming from and what we have done these last few months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we were living through the worst part of the crisis, every one of the actors, whether it was the governments, Parliament or the Commission, agreed that we needed strong and well-organised financial supervision in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since then, the Commission has done its work. It commissioned a report from Jacques de Larosière. This report, which is of a high quality, served as the basis for a package of texts which, I believe, shows a high level of ambition for the introduction of these authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament has also done its work, and in particular, we voted last May, in the ECON parliamentary committee, for a strict text which has gone even further than the Commission’s proposal, taking particular account of the latest developments connected with the crisis in Greece and in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the Council, it has got its scissors out and, from the start, it has been intent on slimming down the proposals that have been made by the Commission. Last December, the Swedish Presidency achieved a unanimous agreement, which, however, Parliament said was not satisfactory, even on the day it signed it. The Spanish Presidency has strived over these last few months, but has not managed to fill in the gaps, and here we are with a new Presidency which has shown a lot of energy since last Thursday, but which has not been in place for long.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For this reason, Parliament accepted that it has to take a rather complicated step, but one which we can explain to the citizens and which involves giving the Belgian Presidency a chance without sacrificing anything fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are making quite a remarkable effort to say that we are going to vote tomorrow on the amendments to the ECON text; there is a text by Parliament in plenary. Quite simply, we are not completing the procedure at first reading in a way which gives our Belgian friends a chance.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to emphasise the points on which, in my view, the Member States will have to move in order for Parliament to accept an agreement. First, there are the issues concerning efficiency. We were reminded of this very well by the previous speakers, and I would like to emphasise that there is a quite remarkable level of agreement between the four main political groups, which allows us to move forward with a common front.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need the authorities to be European; we need them to be able to decide, at the European level, in a certain well-defined number of cases. This is not a question of replacing national supervisors, but when there is an urgent need, when there are toxic products on the market, when there is a violation of Community law, when the national authorities are arguing, we in the internal market really need decisions to be made at the European level. We do not need a safeguard clause. On this question, I would nevertheless like to make a comment. Who do the Member States want to protect themselves from when they plan safeguard clauses against Europe? It is as if there were a conspiracy here, with people aiming to get their hands in the Member States’ coffers. All of that is grotesque. We need a system which works and in which decisions can be taken, and without abuses, as Mr Giegold reminded us, but also without giving a kind of generalised right of veto to Member States who do not want to do anything.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also want these authorities to be located in a single place, for reasons of efficiency. We have made proposals and counter-proposals to which successive Presidencies have not, to this day, deigned to give the slightest response. I believe that, when we ask for employed people to make adjustments which are as important as they are now, saying that the Member States cannot envisage the transfer of some authorities to a single city is a massive joke to our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to make a final point relating to the issues concerning information from Parliament and the control of authorities that we want to be independent. We want them to be independent, but because we want them to be independent, we also want responsibility and dialogue to be possible with those elected by the people. On this matter, we have also made some requests. We have also asked for greater openness from these bodies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say one final word relating to the United States. I am always shocked when people tell us that the Americans have pulled ahead. I also notice that a number of governments are having discussions in two stages. First, we refuse any federal state. We refuse any new stage of integration and we decry the Community method. Then, later, we always compare ourselves to the United States. There comes a time when we have to abide by our responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want a stronger Europe. We want supervisory authorities which are able to function and which can find a place for Europe, at the global level, in this great competition that we are experiencing at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Cassandra had a gift: that of telling the future. She also bore a curse: that of not being listened to. For this reason, Troy fell.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament anticipated more than 10 years ago that liberalising the markets, without putting in place European supervision mechanisms at the same time, would lead to a crisis in the system, for one very simple reason: cross-border institutions cannot be supervised by national authorities whose jurisdiction ends at their borders. They can only be supervised by European authorities. We did not take heed of this, and the crisis erupted. Exotic products, unknown even to their creators, flooded the markets. Nobody trusted anybody else, nobody lent to anybody else, and credit dried up. The result: 23 million unemployed and EUR 3.5 billion – one third of our production – committed to aid the financial sector. Now what?</p>
      <p sl="es">We in Parliament have been at odds with the Council for some days now. Parliament has given a great deal of ground in order to reach an agreement; the Commission too. The Belgian Presidency has shown great willing. It has asked us for time. We are going to give it time, but let us show today that Parliament is united, that it has very clear ideas. For this reason, let us vote massively in favour tomorrow of the amendments that the most influential groups within this House have put forward jointly. There are several ideas that Parliament would like to highlight. The first is that the crisis will only be overcome when confidence recovers and transparency is re-established within markets, institutions and products. This will only be possible when there are European supervision authorities that are credible, strong, independent and subject to democratic control: authorities that are not limited to meekly repeating the slogans emanating from national governments.</p>
      <p sl="es">What does it mean to say that they are European? It means that they must have real power to ban the sale of toxic products; it means that they have real power to put an end to the regulatory distortions that prevent the market from working; it means that they must have real power to require national supervisors to always operate in defence of European interests. National supervisors cannot be feudal lords invested with absolute power. The European authority must ensure that the law is obeyed, that national authorities do what they need to do when there is a threat of pandemic, and that they are able to resolve conflicts when colleges of supervisors do not want to do so, or cannot. They need to be able to require private institutions that are offside to do what they need to do when national colleges of supervisors notice any omissions within the European guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second lesson is that, among cross-border institutions, there is a special, singular type: those known as systemic institutions. An elementary truth about capitalism is that when it is done well, money is made, and when it is done badly, money is lost. This governs everything except systemic institutions. When things are going well, they make a fortune, and when things are going badly, it is the taxpayer who has to run to their aid. To resolve the problem of systemic institutions, there are only two solutions, only two: either supervisors within the countries where they operate are given greater powers to control their solvency and liquidity, which would lead to the removal of the European Parliament from the equation, or truly European institutions are put in place, which is what this House is proposing.</p>
      <p sl="es">This means that European authorities need to watch over these institutions with particular zeal, as their ruin will be the ruin of all. It means that the European institution needs to be provided with resolution and control mechanisms for stabilising endangered institutions, if this is possible, or to wind them up, if this is not possible. Lifeboats should be made ready before the voyage, not in the middle of a storm. Also, these systemic institutions need to be required to pre-finance, to provide funds for guaranteeing the interests of depositors, which is our main concern, and for paying the costs of a crisis when it occurs. What cannot happen is for the taxpayer to have to carry the can again. What cannot happen, as the Americans say so often, is for ‘Main Street’ to have to pay for the excesses of ‘Wall Street’ again.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would ask the ladies and gentlemen of the Council who are absent today – they have been very active this morning, talking on the telephone, and it seems that the storm has passed and things are calm, and they are still not here – to convey the same message through the Commissioner. The Council has asked for time. Parliament has given it time. Let nobody be confused, however: this is not a sign of weakness. This is a sign of the strength of this House. The strength of a body that believes in what it says, and feels that it has the support of the public, who back it. The Council and the Commission, which is doing a magnificent job, needs to make use of this time to forge a parliamentary consensus on the European direction, in the direction of Europe. It must not make use of this time to try and put together blocking minorities in opposition to Parliament. I ask the Council to listen to Cassandra for once. Today, Cassandra is the rapporteurs who have spoken. Cassandra is also Commissioner Barnier. Those who are not Cassandra know only too well to whom I refer.</p>
      <p sl="es">Listen to Parliament, seek an agreement, say here what was said in Toronto. Do not say one thing here and another there. As old Castilians say, if the Council does this, God will reward it, and if not, God will demand it. God and this House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to focus on the EIOPA report, which is about the Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. As most of you are aware, insurance and occupational pensions are two subjects very close to my heart, indeed probably the subjects in which I have been most interested in the ECON Committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">Solvency II, which Parliament voted on last year and on which I was the rapporteur, is the piece of legislation that, in fact, I am most proud of to date. It remains the most comprehensive piece of sectoral financial services legislation voted on in this Parliament. I expect it to reduce both consumer costs and systemic risks posed by the insurance sector, such as they are. A large part of Solvency II is devoted to overcoming the challenges facing supervisors and supervisory colleges in managing the risks and complexities associated with large cross-border insurers. As such, Solvency II is intimately linked with the proposals for EIOPA. EIOPA, in my opinion, provides the oil that will allow Solvency II to operate more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is perhaps because of my experience with Solvency II that I was keen to take on this report. I knew that it was the context in which we could make Solvency II really work. It has also meant that in the ECON debate, I was unable to support some aspects of the more ambitious plans of some of my fellow supervision rapporteurs in the areas they have described that I could initially support, such as day-to-day supervision of financial institutions or resolution funds up by January 2011. This may or may not be appropriate for banks or capital markets, but for insurance, the debate is really open. Insurance is not banking and I am glad that my fellow rapporteurs have accepted that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The concerns I have raised are now recognised by many as legitimate and all parties no longer believe that there is a dispute. Direct supervision and resolution fund projects are for those for the coming years and the rapporteurs are, I believe, converged in their belief on this point. The objective of the Commission is that the three sectoral ISAs should, in fact, be the same in terms of composition. The sectoral legislation, principally in this respect Solvency II and IORP, will define what specific powers EIOPA will have.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, the rapporteurs have worked on the basis that what goes into one ISA at this stage must be read across to the other two, and it is because of my concerns at the outset that some of the ambitions behind this were perhaps not as directly appropriate for insurance and pensions that we have – if you like – the nuances which we can read into the EIOPA. They will not be different but they will be balanced. They are not necessarily the headline-grabbing areas but I believe we can rely upon something which will work – and work just as well across the board as if it were any of the other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of my key objectives was to ensure that there was a counterbalance from the micro cross-sectoral level to the one which is operated by central bankers in the ESRB. Whilst I accept Mr Tremosa’s point about central banks, it is also important that we have this balance in the micro-supervisory field as well. That is why I am so pleased about the joint committee – which we have been able to reveal and to push forward, where we can see that this balance will be held – and that my joint rapporteurs have accepted this point as have, I believe, also the Council and the Commission. This is a real gain for Parliament. I also believe that having, of the three ISAs, one of the revolving chairs as a Vice-President of the ESRB is quite essential also for a plurality of the views which have to be heard from the coalface.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to take into account that EIOPA will be reflecting two connected, but different, sectors so we must have the stakeholder groups involved too, reflecting both those sectors. As I have stated, the ISAs come from sectoral legislation and for insurance, I believe that Solvency II and EIOPA are an excellent marriage.</p>
      <p sl="en">For pensions, the question is up in the air. A lot will now depend upon the Commission’s report on the IORP, and I hope to work closely on this, but I believe that there is a deal here for us to make, a deal which we will make in the forthcoming days – perhaps weeks – which will benefit greatly EIOPA and the role Parliament has played in defining its powers, which I believe will serve consumers and, of course, the authorities around Europe, well.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, never has the European project, built with such effort over the last 50 years, been as threatened as it is today. The European public’s frustration is enormous: the financial system which should serve them has destroyed their savings, their pensions, their investment projects, and their jobs; in short, it has destroyed their future.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In terms of the necessary strengthening of the whole financial services market, banking, insurance, and securities, the road to follow is clear and resides in the architecture which we are discussing here today. In fact, we need strong European supervision architecture, covering all products and actors, endowed with efficient methodologies and intervention instruments capable of responding to a market reality which does not recognise national frontiers, especially in the European context.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Risk cannot and should not be eliminated from the financial market, but we need regulation which makes this risk more transparent, and which avoids the accumulation of bubbles that affect the whole system when they burst, spreading to the real economy. However, if new crises occur in the future despite these defences, it is crucial to have mechanisms available that limit contagion, especially regarding the banking system, because this is vital to the economy’s functioning and is the depositary for Europeans’ savings. Here, in the very powers and competences of the European Banking Authority, resides the capacity to execute a new strategy for the management of transnational crises in the banking sector, a topic referred to in my report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is not in our hands to prevent the bankruptcy of banks, but rather to ensure that their reorganisation or possible winding up are carried out in an orderly fashion, limiting the collateral effects in the rest of the system and, above all, preventing the taxpayer from being the one who foots the bill for the resulting crises. For this, we need a series of new mechanisms, we need to adopt rules, definitions, methodologies, instruments and terminology common to all those intervening in operations of restructuring, reorganisation or winding up. We need to harmonise all the relevant national legal frameworks for crisis management, not least the laws for bankruptcy and winding up. We need to attribute wider powers of intervention to the supervisors. We need to specify clear criteria, not just quantitative but also qualitative, that allow intervention in an institution in difficulty. We need to prepare contingency plans. This entire process takes time for 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, around 50 of the 12 000 banks operating Europe represent 70% of assets. This means an enormous concentration of risk, but also an opportunity to intervene primarily in them. There exist, therefore, conditions for us to propose a special and urgent process of listing those banks whose size and relations with other banks make them transnational, potentially giving them a systemic impact on the financial system. For these banks, it is possible to anticipate special supervision by the new European Banking Authority, even if operating in the college of national supervisors. Owing to the risk that they generate, it is possible and urgent that they begin to make contributions to a fund to finance any interventions that may be necessary; and it is important that the European Banking Authority should create a specialist unit to coordinate interventions in the case of difficulties in these banks.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The package of proposed elements ensures that the interventions in transnational banks of a systemic nature are consistent and coherent between the various countries and, above all, that they comply with a principle very dear to Europe: that the costs of the pollution caused by these banks should be borne by the polluter.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This proposal fits perfectly well in what we are discussing, above all, in the competences of the European Banking Authority; I would even say that it is the most obvious test of its efficiency. There was a huge majority – 87% – in favour of this proposal in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs vote. We are counting on a massive vote in favour in this Chamber too, in the knowledge that by massively supporting this visionary, realistic and pragmatic proposal, we will be taking urgent and necessary action to re-establish Europeans’ faith in Europe, in its financial system, and, especially, in its banking system.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission appreciates the constructive spirit that has guided the trialogues where the regulation on the European Systemic Risk Board was negotiated. I want to thank the rapporteurs for the formidable efforts they have made so far, and the work is bound to continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you well know, the latest trialogue actually took place yesterday evening. We regret that an agreement could not be reached for adoption at first reading at this plenary part-session, but we are satisfied that all parties are committed to carrying out the adoption by September.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that many of the discussions between the Council and Parliament revolve around people and institutions and who will do what in the ESRB. Should the Chair of the ESRB be elected, or should he or she be automatically the ECB President? Should the ESRB general board and steering committee include outside independent experts and, if so, with or without voting rights? Should the President of the EFC participate in the work of the ESRB? I am confident that these diverging requests by the Council and Parliament can be merged into a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same goes for the many discussions revolving around the involvement of the Council and Parliament in the follow-up to the recommendations of the ESRB. There again, an agreement is not far away. I trust there is no divergence that cannot be resolved by a thorough negotiation and appropriate wording to avoid any misunderstanding on the respective prerogatives of both bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">So while I somehow regret that Parliament will not be able to vote on a text fully agreed with the Council now at this session, I am still delighted by the clear willingness shown by all to reach an agreement by September.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me say frankly that we badly needed a modern supervisory architecture, as well as a body doing analysis of systemic risks to macro-financial stability, well before the financial crisis hit Europe. We would be much better off now in dealing with the financial repair if we had already had this at our disposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore want to stress again that the fact that the new supervisory framework will be established rapidly, and certainly by 1 January next year, is indeed sensible. Our citizens expect action without further delays, which should be possible considering how much we agree in the fundamentals and how close we are to an agreement on even the details.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally important, the ESRB is an essential building block of a genuine economic and monetary union of its stronger economic pillar and thus of our systemic response to the financial crisis. It is also a key building block to restore and reinforce confidence in the European economy which is so much needed now. In order to strengthen the economic recovery, to strengthen confidence, we need to deliver on all fronts: safeguard financial stability, pursue fiscal consolidation, conclude financial repair and especially the new supervisory architecture, and reinforce economic governance. Only by making concrete and rapid progress on all these fronts can we strengthen the recovery and solidify the economic and monetary union. I count on your support on these very important endeavours.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was a good idea for Parliament to join the debate on the supervision and management of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also only fair to talk about these two major topics in a more general context, as we will have to act to obtain reinforced capital requirements and improved corporate governance, and to bring these to completion. We will come back to this, as I will have the opportunity of returning, as you know, in the next few weeks or months, to a series of proposals which were put together in an agenda approved by the Commission on 2 June, which the Council of Finance Ministers supported, and which the European Council adopted. We will also see –and I echo what many of you said – if there is a real consistency between decisions taken at the G20, decisions taken at the European Council and decisions taken at the Council of Ministers in the same vein.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are many subjects which are part of this architecture of prevention, crisis management and supervision. I am thinking of the funds for resolutions that we have proposed, like Mrs Ferreira herself, in the context of crisis management. I am also thinking of the earlier proposals of Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, and we will present legislative proposals on these subjects in 2011. There is also financial corporate governance and banking capital. I will come back to this when talking about Mr Karas’ report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say a few words on the two subjects for today. First, I will address supervision, which is effectively the backbone. This is an extremely serious subject and, as you have said, if we do not succeed in creating credible authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board, many other reforms will not be effective. Some weeks ago, we spoke of rating agencies – I will come back to these – and the implementation of prudential norms. We need this credible European architecture of supervision. This is why I want to welcome the high level of ambition that has been shown by your rapporteurs throughout the past few months: Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, Mr Skinner, Mr Sánchez Presedo, Mrs Goulard, Mr Giegold, Mr Tremosa i Balcells and Mr Balz, and particularly the level of ambition concerning the power of these authorities and their legally binding authority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We find here the spirit and the philosophy of the Commission’s proposals. We found some new ideas there, which we should use, to improve the European system of financial supervision, as well as the reinforcement of consumer protection that Mr Giegold proposed, notably to prohibit certain financial products. I am thinking of the role given to the authorities in the identification of systemic risks and in crisis situations. I am thinking of the reinforcement of the joint committee, as advocated by Mr Skinner. I am thinking of the improvement in the transparency of the markets, which we discussed in the context of the Omnibus Directive that Mr Sánchez Presedo is piloting.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are only a few examples: the most difficult things still lie ahead of us. Naturally, we have done a lot of work or, in any case, I have worked with you, for five months. We have made a lot of progress, but even if we are in the final straight, as I hope we are, we have not yet arrived at an agreement and what I would call a dynamic and credible compromise so that this can function. Although she is not here today, I want to welcome the Belgian Presidency, who, from the first few hours – 1 July, 10.00 in the morning – has responded through her finance minister, Didier Reynders, and who participated, very late yesterday evening, in a trialogue with many of you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to repeat what Mr García-Margallo y Marfil said. We need the Council to understand that now is the time to act and to make progress. Others have also said this. In any case, the Commission, with the competences that it has, will do whatever is necessary to encourage the Council to seize the opportunity that you are giving it – this is my understanding of the situation. The ball is in its court to use these few days to reach an intelligent and credible agreement. You can count on me to be available.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say a few words on crisis management and prevention in order to thank Mrs Ferreira for her commitment. I have myself believed in precautionary measures for a long time. I have thought for a very long time that, as regards ecological risk, industrial risk and financial risk, the polluter must pay, that a cure always costs more than prevention, and that, when we need to prevent or cure, it is not the taxpayers who should be called upon first and foremost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the spirit of the toolbox that we will be presenting to the Council of Ministers. We will bring forward many of the tools that Mrs Ferreira herself proposed, and we will translate these proposals into legislative proposals. I make the commitment that a legislative text will be presented to you. This is a subject on which I committed myself on the very first day – on 13 January – before you and before the ministers, during the course of my hearing and at the Ecofin Council in Madrid. You can count on me to present this credible toolbox, relying on the proposals of Mrs Ferreira, because, once again, I am convinced, in this area as well as others, that prevention costs a lot less than cure.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to say that I am speaking as the shadow rapporteur for the opinion.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The current financial crisis has highlighted the lack of effective management of crisis situations which have arisen in cross-border financial entities in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There have been different approaches adopted at national level. In general, the authorities have either used public funds to bail out the banks or they have isolated the banks’ assets in their own country, applying national instruments to tackle crisis situations, but only at the level of their own branches.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These actions have heightened the risks associated with the loss of confidence, distortion of competition, legal uncertainty and the high level of costs incurred for bailing out the banks, borne by taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, we need measures at European level to stop the management of crises involving a cross-border banking group using national systems, which may be extremely different, and which tend to protect branches located on their own territory and not resolve the problem faced by the group as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has confronted us with the evidence that greater coordination at European level is an absolute priority for the development and stability of the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">That said, I shall limit myself here to highlighting one fundamental issue, particularly in the light of the difficult trialogues still ongoing. If giving financial oversight authorities the power to adopt individual, directly binding decisions – as provided for in Article 10 of the regulations – responds to the political desire to react quickly to emergency situations, then in the case of daily supervision, this power conflicts with Articles 17 and 258 of the treaty, which state that it is the exclusive power of the Commission to ensure the application of the law of the Union. Furthermore, in this case, a paradoxical situation would be created in which the Member States, present in the highest body through their own authorities, would be indirectly responsible for applying the law of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I proposed a compromise amendment which attempts to resolve this discrepancy between the powers conferred on the authorities and the role and competences of the Commission, in full compliance with the treaty. I hope that the contribution of the Legal Affairs Committee can be used as a basis for any further compromises with the other European institutions in order to arrive swiftly at a much needed solution, which is completely in accordance with the law of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we may have a single internal market, but we have a fragmented supervisory body. It is obvious that this cannot work. We need strong central European structures which utilise the expertise and in-depth knowledge of the Member States’ agencies, while also having intervention powers to be used in emergencies. If only in light of the huge tax burden imposed on them by this crisis, citizens are expecting a quick, sound decision to be made in this House without delay. If there are power games being played at national level merely as to who decides what, this is of little interest to citizens. What citizens want is for an effective decision to be made to get problems resolved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Objectively speaking, if measures are required in an emergency, they must be dealt with and a decision made centrally at European level if coordination between Member States is inadequate and does not work. This is the line taken for decisions made by the G20 and G8, as well as by Heads of State or Government, but unfortunately, this is not the case at Council level. The Council only takes a narrow-minded approach. The public do not find this policy acceptable. We expect the Council to take action.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioners, if the European Union’s Member States want to be strong economically and externally, they must present a united front as the European Union. The financial markets supervision package, with a European Systemic Risk Board which is as powerful as possible, is therefore exactly what is needed, along with strong European – and I stress the word ‘European’ – banking, securities and insurance supervisory authorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Systemic Risk Board is – if you allow me to make the comparison – somewhat akin to the Federal President of Germany. In his current form, he does not have any far-reaching intervention powers – I would have liked him to have more – but he can display great moral authority. This means he can issue warnings, make recommendations, and all of this in public. The European Parliament – and I consider this to be a particular success – also insisted on stakeholders from civil society being included on the Board of the ESRB, in other words, consumer protection groups, trade unions and scientists. I really do regard this as an extremely positive move which should be highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="de">On that note, I would like to call on Member States not to resort to the outdated methods of the past to create the economic order of the 21st century, but to think and act in a European spirit.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioners, European supervision of financial markets is the minimum that we can do. It will require the regulation of rating agencies. We have seen what the instruments of speculation against states are, but the supervisory authorities that we have to introduce must not repeat the same mistakes by being both judge and jury. As a result, the issue of control has not been resolved: the control must be political. This regulation is necessary but not sufficient if we do not supplement it with an economic governance of the euro area and the European Union which goes beyond the Stability Pact. It is also insufficient if we do not take real measures against the flight of capital to tax havens. Finally, this European supervision will be insufficient if we do not take measures so that the regulation is also implemented at a global level.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the UK, the new government has taken radical action to overhaul and provide the necessary reform at a national level. Equally, the new European framework must radically improve both the quality and coherence of regulatory supervision. It needs an independent structure – truly independent in a regulatory sense – but there is a balance to be struck. The current proposals would allow the EU to overrule national regulators, and the danger is that technical standards may be used to actually make and dictate policy choices at an EU level.</p>

It seems to me at the moment, Madam President, that once this commitment becomes manifest tomorrow, the Commission has a first order function in negotiations with the Council.

One year on from the European elections, when we announced in public how we wanted to bring the finance markets into line, we are now at a point where our success rate ranges from very little to none at all.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem has already been explained. We are dealing with markets which operate globally nowadays. Member States still believe that they can use their national supervisory structures to apply rules in this environment. The fact that this did not work was not what actually triggered the financial crisis, but it contributed to Europe being affected by it as well. This is why I would ask when this realisation, which is often mentioned in grandiose speeches, will be converted into political action, where it is suddenly about protecting stock exchange centres and banking structures and no longer about protecting citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is the task to which we have committed ourselves as the European Parliament.

Crisis examples, such as Fortis Bank, exposed grounds for such suspicion and the need for a European supervisory architecture and discipline. Solvency II convinced me that cross-border insolvency and near-insolvency in financial institutions have to be tackled at the European level.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to address the Council, and obviously I, like many of us, am frustrated that I cannot do this directly, because I would like to say to the Council that Parliament is being reasonable in this matter. It is simply asking for European supervision for European actors and national supervision for national actors. It is asking for consumer protection and, in particular, the prohibition of products which everyone here would describe as toxic, and not just here, but also in industry, in the workplace. If they are toxic, why authorise them? It is obviously asking for binding actions. All of this does not seem to me to amount to extremism. Why can the Council not accept that? I think that the patience of our fellow citizens and the patience of this Parliament is coming to an end. If we give the Belgian Presidency a chance to act, this chance will be taken and we will have results next week.</p>

Here lies the essence of the entire debate on financial architecture and the supervision of financial architecture. We have currency union. Currency union cannot be separated – even according to the science of economics – from fiscal union, and the latter cannot exist without political union.</p>

All the proposals we have made were strongly watered down in the trialogues. The Council and the governments do not want strong intervention rights. Mr Giegold is right when he described what is currently going on as ‘parochial’. The intention seems to be not to tighten the regulations, but simply to design a system which is slightly less prone to breaking down. We will get a fragmented supervisory structure which will be incapable of exercising proper control over the financial markets. Inadequate conclusions are being drawn from this financial and economic crisis, which means that the next crisis is already brewing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many national economies, including those in Europe, will not withstand the blows to come, with all the social and economic repercussions this entails for people living in Europe. They are expecting this predatory financial market capitalism to be tamed and the dominance of politics to be restored. If the CEO of UniCredit Bank, Alessandro Profumo, says as he did at the weekend that we need a strong, uniform European Financial Supervisory Authority and a common set of rules for all Member States, calling for tighter capital rules, this is an appeal to this Parliament to actually draw up these rules. It is this European Parliament’s job to exert pressure on the Council and enforce effective regulation as a matter of urgency. This would be just the first step to a status quo ante .</p>

I would not want the reactions of the European institutions, and ours in particular, to miss the mark in their response to the crisis and the recent financial scandals.</p>
      <p sl="it">To create new laws and new so-called independent authorities may not, in fact, be the essential and decisive solution to the current problems.

      <p sl="it">I agree that we need closer coordination between the various national authorities but I also believe that it is not necessary to sanction everything in this area. Maintaining the possibility of having autonomous supervisory bodies is, in my opinion, surely preferable in order to provide greater protection for investments and savers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I am convinced that politics should take more responsibility. As the only European institution which is directly accountable to the people, I believe that we must not relinquish our prerogatives.

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I confess that I find it difficult to follow my fellow Members who are so fond of flexing their muscles and claiming a monopoly of our legitimacy in relation to the other institutions of the Union. Unfortunately, they often take a ridiculous stance. However, when the members of this House, through work and conviction, put forward a well-argued position when we defend what would appear to be the general European interest, confronted with somewhat tense nations, then it is a different matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this debate on European supervision, Parliament has played this role. On the subject of the European Systemic Risk Board, for which I am the shadow rapporteur for my group, I, like the rapporteur, Mrs Goulard, defended an ambitious position. I advocated mechanisms which would ensure a certain amount of efficiency, and I emphasised the supremacy of the European Central Bank. Why is this? Because the European Central Bank is the only Community institution in this group, and because it has shown itself to be serious.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Out of a spirit of Christian charity, I will not mention the names of all the institutions and all these great figures who suddenly disappeared during the storm. We can consider ourselves fortunate to have at least had a captain on board during the worst part of the crisis. I would therefore be reassured if tomorrow we see macro-prudential supervision attached to a strong Community institution, with micro-prudential surveillance necessarily remaining fragmented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In these troubled times, the European Systemic Risk Board must get to work as quickly as possible. The future will show if changes are necessary, but it is essential to start on a healthy basis, because systemic risks affect the entire European and worldwide banking sector.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The current economic crisis has shown us that we need a system to prevent crises and contain their adverse effects.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The de Larosière report, published in February 2009, examined financial supervision in the European Union, proposing the creation of a sui generis body which will be responsible for macro-economic supervision at European Union level and offer a solution to the current weaknesses.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, the European Parliament has been asking the Commission, as far back as 2000, to come up with proposals intended to guarantee the stability of the European Union’s financial markets. In practical terms, the European Union is at a critical juncture where it must prove its worth to its citizens who are expecting it to provide solutions to the current economic recession and effective mechanisms for preventing future economic recessions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There has been talk about a democratic deficit in the European Union, about the decline in the level of European citizens’ participation in the European Parliament elections, about their failure to identify with European policies. This is why I believe that the Treaty of Lisbon can really mark an important step towards remedying these shortcomings. However, this is only a start. A strong foundation needs to be laid which will foster confidence in Europe’s economic and political system through stability and the benefits gained.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We need an effective supervision system which will create the conditions for providing the economy with stable finances and ensuring economic growth and sustainable jobs. The unity of the European single market must also be supervised if we want to avoid its fragmentation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I ultimately feel that the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board and Financial Supervisory Authorities is appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even the members of the Council realise that the weaknesses of the supervisory system are or were one of the causes of the biggest global financial crisis experienced since the 1930s. They are also aware that national measures alone are not sufficient to deal with the consequences of this crisis, but that we need to look for global, or at least European, solutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Council should know that the European Parliament does not want an independent European supervisory structure and systemic risk board to be set up out of dogmatism or stubbornness, but from a deeply-held, cross-party conviction. This is the only way of guaranteeing transparency and protection for investors, based on a uniform regulatory framework and a uniform interpretation and application of this framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">One clear message from the crisis is that we need not less, but greater involvement from Europe in the financial sector; if we do not go forwards, than we will go backwards. Member States should drop the hypocrisy they display when calling for global solutions at G20 meetings and demanding at least European regulations at home, but actually refusing to make any compromise in the trialogues.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we should not be complacent about our work in this area and should not look down on the United States. Actually, on the one hand, the US is much closer to making comprehensive new legislation on financial sector regulation and supervision. They are also concentrating more on substance than on a turf war. The new legislation, which is before the US Congress, envisages a consumer bureau with substantive powers to give rulings, including a total ban on specific financial products. Standardised derivatives will be traded on established exchanges and forced through clearing-houses. Hedge funds and private equity firms will have to register with the SCC over and above a certain, very large capital limit.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are discussing how to distribute the powers between European institutions and national institutions. Well, the solution is quite easy. The macro-prudential institutions, like the ECSRB, should be closely linked with the European Central Bank, a European institution, but micro-prudential institutions need to be coordinated among national institutions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the measures for the supervision of the European financial system must – and this should be better emphasised in the report – have a priority objective, which must be very clear and strongly supported: to establish strict rules to control the derivatives market as this is one of the main causes, if not the main cause, of the current financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">Here, instead, we are, above all, designing a centralised institution, to some extent copied from the model of the ECB. This is not good, because at this point it is not known or fully clear what the role of the national supervisory bodies will be – the Banca d'Italia in our country. It seems that they are being watered down somewhat to the role of agent, which is not a particularly well-defined role. Instead, oversight should begin in our countries. In Italy, for example, it happens via a system of local branches which can monitor situations well.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, why should the headquarters of the European agency be in Frankfurt? Who decided that? Based on what criteria, if not in order – I would say – to make it conformant with the European Central Bank? We propose it be sited in Milan, for example, which is a major financial and banking market, including from a geo-economic point of view due to its position at the centre of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that this plan should generally go much deeper, with measures that require courage to implement, such as introducing a separation between commercial and investment banks in European legislation, based on the principles of the old US law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the current crisis has taught us that when a European bank runs into trouble, its problems can spill across borders. An EU-wide system of financial supervision is being established to deal with the prevention of such situations, while an integrated European framework for cross-border crisis management will hopefully compliment the supervisory architecture as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last two years have proven that relying on national approaches to cope with crises is clearly a sub-optimal solution. The new system will have to be developed in such a way that a crisis can be handled cost-effectively, moral hazards eliminated and taxpayer finance bailouts excluded. Asset transfers will have to be regulated in a manner that ensures a level playing field, especially for host countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">The cross-border crisis management system – based on 28 regime concepts – should be designed in a way that would eliminate the interdependence between banks and national budgets. It should also contribute to the emergence of a single banking market of the Union. After all, if we had a single banking market in Europe, we would not have to talk about cross-border crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, let me emphasise that all the elements of the European financial stability framework, as well as the resolution regime for cross-border institutions, should be adopted urgently to reduce uncertainty and fragilities in the banking sector. Having a European mechanism in place would also allow Europe to be more effective in ensuring that global solutions materialise quickly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate all rapporteurs on their work on this package of highly significant reforms. This overhaul of the EU’s financial architecture has been a huge undertaking for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and has dominated much of my first year as an MEP.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am glad that it appears that we are close to agreement. A proper functioning of Union and global financial systems and the mitigation of threats requires better consistency between macro- and micro-supervision. In retrospect, it seems astonishing that we did not have a single EU-wide macro-prudential body doing just this. Our financial markets for countries both inside and outside the eurozone are so closely integrated that an oversight body looking at market trends, asset bubbles, future causes of systemic risks and imbalances would perhaps have led to a faster, more coordinated response to the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The crisis has demonstrated many things: that our regulatory framework was not robust enough; that markets do not always self-correct; and worse, that they were exposed to unmonitored systemic risks. I welcome, in particular, the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board, a body designed to act as a watchdog giving an early warning of systemic risks or imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard, the most immediate priority is to provide a qualitative definition of systemic risk to enable effective functioning. The recent development that stress tests are to be published for some of the largest banks in the EU is welcome. I hope the Commission will follow this example, by likewise carrying out and publishing stress tests for public finances of all Member States on a regular basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, Parliament has put in an enormous effort and showed political will to compromise and agree this package of reforms before the recess, but we should take heart that the deal is within sight and we can still have these reforms in place before January 2011.</p>

Particularly for financial institutions operating across borders, a central body is required which can join forces with the national supervisory bodies at the crucial time and provide rapid, targeted intervention. Direct intervention rights are imperative where there are differences between national authorities at times of emergencies and also where there are infringements of Community law.</p>

Numerous discussions have taken place and work has been carried out in Parliament quickly and purposefully.

      <p sl="hu">The crisis has taught us all some painful lessons. We cannot allow financial institutions to carry out speculative and unsupervised activities which pose a risk to the job security of millions. The new supervisory authorities will serve exactly this purpose. I am glad that the compromise suggestions made to the Council included amendments that are important for Central and Eastern European countries. For instance, it was accepted that central bank presidents of Member States outside the euro area will have the right to participate in the managing bodies of the European Systemic Risk Board, and it was also accepted that a simple majority decision-making process will be used if there is a dispute between supervisory authorities. The new supervisory authorities will have to be established by the start of the Hungarian Presidency, that is, by 1 January 2011. In order to reach a compromise, I believe it is necessary for both the Council and Parliament to make concessions when technically expedient and reasonable. For instance, the Council should allow the seats of all new authorities to be in Frankfurt, it should allow cross-border financial institutions to be placed under the supervision of the European supervisory bodies, and it should make it possible for these bodies to operate independently from the Commission. Parliament should also make concessions. Fellow Members, I do believe it would suffice if we focused exclusively on strategic guidance instead of establishing technical standards. Finally, ECOFIN should be granted the right to announce an economic crisis. I trust that a compromise agreement can be made along these lines by September at the latest, and that the new institutions will be in place on 1 January.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Many of you, ladies and gentlemen – Mr Ferber, a moment ago, Mrs Győri, Mr Balčytis, Mr Karas just now – mentioned the citizens. I think that it is good to remind people of the shock, the concertina effect, the human social consequences of this financial crisis, along with its economic and social consequences, which have not come to an end. We are indeed carrying out this reform for the citizens. I think, like many of you, that if a new crisis should occur – the risks in various sectors were mentioned a moment ago – without us having learned the lessons from the financial crisis over the past two years, and without us having created tools of prevention and precaution, the citizens will not forgive us. This is very much a reform for the citizens. This is a question of putting financial services, the markets, in the service of the real economy, employment and therefore the citizens. This is one of my priorities, quite apart from what we are saying at the moment this afternoon, Madam President, on other points of concern to the citizens, such as the protection of citizens who are consumers of certain financial products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just today, the Commission adopted, at my suggestion, the revision of the directive on deposit guarantees, the revision of the directive on compensation for investors and a White Paper on guarantees in the insurance sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Lulling mentioned a point which is of interest to my colleague, Olli Rehn. It is clear, Mrs Lulling, that the President of the Central Bank must have a pre-eminent role in the European Systemic Risk Board. The exact mechanism for nominating the president is a point on which we are working with my colleague, Olli Rehn.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Klinz, I would like to thank you for the support that you are showing us. You reminded us of the importance of applying our rules properly. This is the very idea behind a single rule book, which I am personally very much in favour of.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say again to Mr Lamberts and Mr Giegold, who is here, that the question of the European authorities prohibiting certain products or certain transactions is an idea which interests me. I am open to this idea, which would mean that the supervisory authorities grouped together in the new European network must be proactive in the supervision of products, particularly the most harmful ones, which may pose a risk to financial stability and the protection of consumers that I have just mentioned. That must be embarked upon, Mr Giegold, well before we talk about a ban. I could imagine an important coordinating role for the authorities in this area. The Council also accepted that the authorities may have such a role. I think that it is possible to come to an agreement on a text which ensures a large scope of application while foreseeing the possibility of taking action on dangerous products or transactions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Hübner, Mr Méndez de Vigo, Mr Balz and Mr Audy mentioned the cross-border mission of these institutions. The proposal of the ECON committee to hand control of cross-border institutions to the authorities is an option which poses political and technical problems that I suggest you should not ignore. The important thing for me is to have in place, by 1 January 2011, authorities which have real binding powers to deal with the lack of coordination and the weakness or failure of supervision noticed in the past, to act in cases of emergency, to ensure respect for Community law and to control the rating agencies that many of you have mentioned this afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, after these authorities have been functioning for three years, and when their reputation on the markets is established, we will carry out an evaluation together with you to see if a change in competences is required.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Bodu, the Chair, Mr Lehne, and Mrs Regner also gave their support to the work that we are doing together. I think that we effectively need, as I have just said, real European supervision which is efficient and coordinated. This is why it is very important that we use the days that we have before us intelligently so that we can succeed in convincing the Council to grab the ball that is now in its court, and to take the opportunity that you have offered it to provide detail on these matters and to reach a true agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Baldassarre mentioned a worry that Mr Lehne also has concerning the powers of the authorities. I would like to remind Mr Baldassarre that the proposals that I have made on behalf of the Commission, which were also made before me, have been prepared with our legal service, without prejudice to the powers of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Pittella, Mr Méndez de Vigo, Mrs De Sarnez just now, Mrs Goulard, Mr Ferber and Mrs Lulling reminded us of the ambition of the proposals put forward by the de Larosière group. As Mrs Goulard also said, I would remind you that these are proposals that were made at the request of President Barroso. We have tried, in the Commission proposal, to stay as close as possible and even sometimes to go a bit further than the ambition of the de Larosière report on this European architecture. I would like to repeat to you my wish, in the weeks and, I hope, the days to come, with the cooperation that we will enjoy with the council of finance ministers, to stay as close as possible to the credibility and ambition of these initial proposals by the Commission, which are based on the proposal by Mr de Larosière.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say a word on a subject which Mr Bokros and Mr Audy mentioned earlier on relating to accounting standards. This has to do with the transatlantic calibration that I sometimes mention. I am not worried about the energetic interaction between Americans and Europeans. At the moment, 80% of financial exchanges take place on both sides of the Atlantic. The other regions of the world are there, between the Americans and the Europeans. I notice that President Obama and European leaders have signed the agreements and have taken the decisions together at the G20. We therefore have the same road map. Also, the last G20 was something of a follow-up G20, in my view. Even if it were only that, it is important that we show the same determination to implement what has already been decided and which is a long way from being implemented. The Americans adopted a different method from our own – they adopted a global package. They will now need to open the drawers one by one to implement these decisions. As for us, we have a series of proposals, which are currently being examined, on the regulation on hedge funds and private equity, the one which has just been adopted on CRD 3, and the one which I hope will be adopted on supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Brick by brick, week after week, we will come up with all the proposals expected of the Commission in implementing the G20 decisions. This is why I wanted not just to do the same thing as the Americans, but to give you an overall vision so that journalists, businesses, markets, citizens and European and national parliamentarians have an overall global vision, and to put this entire agenda into a complete and coherent document, which was adopted last 2 June and which is now our road map.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On some points, the Americans have achieved somewhat more, but we will also take action on one extremely important point, namely the regulation of derivatives and short selling, this coming September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that there are real parallels between the Americans and the Europeans. We are not always using the same tools, and we will not always use the same methods. Our banking sectors are quite dissimilar. I would remind you that in Europe, the banks finance between two-thirds and three-quarters of the economy. In the United States, it is the other way around. We do not always have the same banking structures. We will not always have the same tools, but we must achieve the same objectives within a similar timescale. The only point, Madam President, where we have a debate which may become a matter of divergence is the point that Mr Audy mentioned, which is the extremely important point regarding accounting standards. On this subject, we are having a confident dialogue with the Americans, but one without naivety.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I would say in conclusion, and I thank you for your speeches.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I propose that we imagine for a moment what would have happened in Europe with this huge crisis without the euro. In my case, I could argue that Spain would probably have had a big corralito .</p>
      <p sl="en">The euro was created 11 years ago. Creating a single currency was not an easy process and there were great speculative attacks on very important European currencies. However, I think that the benefits and advantages of the euro for the eurozone citizens are much higher than the costs associated with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Dear colleagues, now we are experiencing another European momentum; another European train – European financial supervision – has arrived at the train station and it is waiting for the European countries to jump on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also say that we will not have another opportunity to rescue the financial sector if there is another financial crisis and we continue doing business as usual. I will not say ‘in the ECB we trust’, because I know that my colleague, Sven Giegold, does not like to mix economy and religion, but the further step towards a European financial authority increases the role of the European Central Bank in European financial supervision.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a special responsibility within the area of financial services, as it is the world leader with regard to banking and insurance, and the world’s second largest securities market. Europeans expect a system of supervision that guarantees the reliability and strength of our financial services and we cannot disappoint them.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that we should make use of the time and reach a speedy agreement. We could go further in three directions: firstly, ensuring the effectiveness of decisions by the authorities in cases of emergency; secondly, clearly demonstrating our commitment to savers having priority with regard to protection for deposit institutions; thirdly, moving towards a European system for crisis resolution. Those who advocated self-regulation in the past now need to accept self-financing. The public cannot be the ones who have to pay the bills and carry the can during the next crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are three directions within the ‘Omnibus’ Directive: firstly, adapting ourselves to the Treaty of Lisbon; secondly, increasing transparency, providing information on sanctions to the European Securities and Markets Authority, and ensuring that financial institutions provide the information required to guarantee responsible investment; and thirdly, ensuring that there are correlation tables for the transposition of directives.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to end by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs: my compatriots Mr Tremosa and Mr García-Margallo, Mr Giegold and Mrs Goulard, Mr Skinner and Mrs Ferreira. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, those who put forward amendments, all those who made contributions, the secretarial staff, the group administrators and my assistants. They have done an excellent job, which has not yet borne fruit. I would also like to say that I acknowledge the work of the representatives of the Presidency and the Commission. However, we do not have Cassandra’s calling within this House; we wish to legislate and carry out effective supervision.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-430" speaker_id="96730" name="Sven Giegold" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tremosa i Balcells, ladies and gentlemen, even if I feel tempted now to touch on the subject of religion, mainly because of the emphasis placed several times on the principle of subsidiarity, I always find it irritating whenever this principle inspired by Christian social ethics is used to state that we should have as little as possible at European level. This principle clearly states that everything should be regulated at the level where it can be best regulated, and at the lowest possible level. However, what we have seen is that financial supervision involving major cross-border institutions in a single internal market is simply no longer working at national level. It is a pity therefore that my fellow Members are no longer present. Otherwise, I would have been glad to make them even more familiar with the principles of Christian social ethics.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, one thing which is also important to me is this compromise which we are now producing. We hope – obviously with your help, Mr Barnier – that we will actually now produce it quickly in order to avoid any misunderstanding here. Parliament tabled a last-minute compromise last week. According to the current interpretation we have, the points on which we indicate that we would be willing to change our position again, as part of a compromise we find difficult, are now taken as read, and all the other points are to be renegotiated.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rationale behind this is as follows; Parliament will approve because we all want the authorities to get started on 1 January 2011. The only thing I can say about this is that we all want the authorities to get started, but we will fight for strong powers. It does not work if an inch being given ultimately results in a mile being taken. This method will fail. The consensus in Parliament on this is too strong, and we want a compromise, but only with strong powers. I hope that this signal is also clearly understood by the absent Council. Otherwise, we are all going to find it very uncomfortable next week.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say three things.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first is that while we are flexible on the procedure, we will be even stricter on the substance. Let us be quite clear. We have made an effort. This Parliament agreed to interrupt the procedure of first reading. Nothing forced us to do that, other than the desire, which you have yourself shown, to seek a compromise, to have a discussion with each other. This should not end up as cherry picking. No. Parliament has, for a number of months now, been developing a very consistent vision, and I thank all my fellow Members for this. I cannot mention all of them. I will just mention Mr Karas as an example, who emphasised the fact that we wanted a European solution. This is our line; this is what we believe in for reasons of efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second remark has to do with the date. Yes, we want something by 1 January and, furthermore, I would say that I could repeat Mr Giegold’s words exactly: ‘we spend so much time together and we are so much in agreement that we end up repeating ourselves’, but I repeat this once again. The date is not a fetish. We do not want 1 January for its own sake. It is 1 January with good reason. What we do not want is to put pressure on Parliament only to get, on 1 January, a pretence of European supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all my colleagues here who have spoken, because we feel that there is a genuine basic unity in this Parliament. Of course, everyone has their sensitive issues here, but we need to ask ourselves – and, Commissioner, I would also have asked this question if the Presidency had been here – what will we take back to the citizens at the end of all this. Will we have at least laid the foundations – I will not go as far as saying the top floor, but at least the foundations – of a solid European house, or will we return with one of these pseudo-compromises which the Council has a taste for, but which Parliament would quite happily do without?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, please inform the Council that there is a convergence of opinions in this House that is rarely seen.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council must take note: for six months, it has been telling us that it had a fixed mandate from the Swedish Presidency, and now we also have a mandate.</p>
      <p sl="es">While we are talking about Cassandra, the important thing is not to prophesise the past, which is what the Spanish Presidency did, but to prophesise the future, which is what the Belgian Presidency seems to want to do.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have a consensus that is just as strong as the one within the Council, with an added advantage, which is that the winds favour Parliament’s stance and do not favour the old and anachronistic stance that the Council maintained up until the start of the Belgian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have the advantage that we incorporated proposals that had been rejected; proposals that were in the de Larosière report, such as the resolution mechanisms to which Mrs Ferreira has referred. It makes no sense to put in place a supervisor that can forecast the weather but cannot do anything in the case of shipwreck.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have the advantage that we anticipated things that other institutions said later. When we talked about systemic institutions, we were told that there was no such species; the European Council acknowledged its existence in March.</p>
      <p sl="es">When we talked about how the taxpayer should not have to bear the cost of the crisis and that pre-financed funds should be established by the sector for facing up to its responsibilities, we were told that this was premature, utopian or simply idiotic. Then, the Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the Commission said it, Ecofin said it, the European Council said it and took it to Toronto, and I would not understand why they are not advocating it now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Bill Shankly, a famous Liverpool football manager was once asked by columnists whether he thought football was a matter of life and death. He replied ‘no, it’s much more serious than that’. I think that the passion which he showed then is also being shown by many of the rapporteurs and the shadows in this particular field. I would like to thank everybody who has participated in this. We have converged from different directions but we have come out with a strong Parliament voice. I think it is convincing – here we stand united – being able to convince many that this is right and appropriate at the European level of discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The White Paper on the insurance guarantee scheme which you mentioned, Mr Commissioner, is, in fact, very important for us, and we look forward to that. Alongside the issues of binding mediation, it carries us towards what Sharon Bowles was referring to in terms of the issue of group support – something which was left out of Solvency II. Indeed, in terms of supervision, on a scale of things, I think we can be rightly proud that what we have is still a very ambitious project, something that I believe will lead to the right actions at European level in the future. We should be proud.</p>
      <p sl="en">On an international level, we should be proud too. I would agree with you, Mr Commissioner, that in comparison with the United States, we can speak positively about what we have done in our backyard on structural reform that the United States has failed to achieve, even in its most recent finance bill, especially in insurance, and that we can take this to Washington when we need to.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I do not necessarily agree with you on international financial accounting. You will not be surprised to hear that. I do not agree with using historical trends.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, on supervision, the rapporteurs deserve a pat on the back. We have far to go and I think it is close, but it is like a game of football after all. We have gone through full time, we are now in extra time. Let us hope it does not have to go to a penalty shoot-out.</p>

      <p sl="it">The EU cannot tackle this type of emergency promptly and effectively because it lacks suitable political and economic mechanisms and common rules. Firstly, we need a supervisory system that actually works, that goes beyond the bureaucratic approach used so far to tackle the systemic crises. Secondly, it is crucially important to coordinate and harmonise economic and fiscal policies, even if it means leaving behind those countries that are most reluctant to harmonise these policies. The European Union has a political, social and moral duty to intervene. That duty finds its justification in the values underpinning the Union and enshrined in the treaties. First and foremost, however, the Union has its own concern: the recent global crisis has already amply demonstrated how interconnected the financial systems are, and the Member States of the euro area are even more interconnected. Thus, in order to avert a crisis that could have much more serious consequences, it is necessary to monitor and intervene by means of strict external controls. The economy can only function with healthy financial markets dedicated to it. This is one of the conditions that must be met if citizens are to make the internal market, the European market, their own.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mrs Bowles, on behalf of the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Financial Stability Fund, a European financial stabilisation mechanism and future action (O-0095/2010 - B7-0318/2010).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in so many matters nowadays, the expression ‘the devil is in the detail’ is quoted. At times, this is becoming too much of an excuse for pronouncing conclusions aimed at markets, without realising that a less than fulsome follow-up negates the conclusions, or even does more harm than good.</p>
      <p sl="en">I said this about the banks’ stress tests, where we need transparent and credible assumptions, as well as results, published. I said it earlier when it was taking too long to come up with the detail on the Greek rescue, and the committee has, in fact, been demanding more details for months. We are the devils that look at the detail, and we want more of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 11 May, the European Stabilisation Mechanism was established utilising the EU budget. It had taken so long to deliver on the earlier promises that this was not enough, so, on 7 June, the more general European Financial Stability Facility was created. A bit more haste would have been useful, and perhaps cheaper.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are potential knock-on effects, as a result of these new instruments, for the EU budget and also for borrowing by other EU institutions, such as the EIB. It will be damaging if, once again, there has, in effect, been a bailout arranged for banks holding sovereign debt, and lending to SMEs in the real economy is what pays the price. So what plans are there to mitigate such an effect, given that growth is so important to recovery and SMEs will be in the vanguard of that?</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Special Purpose Vehicle itself, in the interests of EU solidarity, those countries that are not in the eurozone but wish to join the Stabilisation Mechanism should be able to do so. Can you confirm that the rules of the SPV are being changed to permit this? Indeed, more generally, as was raised in committee yesterday, we would like to know more about this off-balance-sheet vehicle, Member States’ accounting treatment of it and the advice for setting it up.</p>
      <p sl="en">There remain many other questions. How will the coordination between the stabilisation fund and the IMF operate? Will allocation be made on the 2:1 basis, reflecting the pledged amounts, and what is the relationship between the respective interest rates? Will the EU and IMF loans rank pari passu or will only the IMF loans benefit from exclusion in any eventual restructuring of the borrowers’ obligations. Is this all the right way around? Should the IMF be topping up an EU rescue, or should it be the other way round? Is the SPV active now or must first calls use the EU budget mechanism?</p>
      <p sl="en">I would now like to turn to Eurobonds. There is a fundamental question to face here, that if there is a general Eurobond with a common interest rate, then one of the most powerful incentives for fiscal discipline – market forces – is lost. Market forces are not popular right now. They were, in fact, sleeping as Greece and others ratcheted up debt much earlier on, but there are reasons for that embedded in the zero-risk weight applied to sovereign debt in the Capital Requirements Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Had that not been there, banks would progressively have been weaned off riskier bonds and spreads would have reflected better the fiscal positions of Member States and we would not be bailing banks out again via the Stabilisation Mechanism and, indeed, the forthcoming stress tests would be a whole lot less stressful.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of the new economic governance, surely this has to be fixed in the longer term and I would say automatically, not as part of a politically determined excess deficit procedure that takes away the zero-risk weight. But I think that here we have the opportunity to turn what is a problem in the Capital Requirements Directive into a useful tool in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since writing this oral question, I am pleased that the Commission has indicated its intention to involve Parliament in economic governance, surveillance procedures and forthcoming legislation, and the committee looks forward to participating wholeheartedly in that involvement.</p>

    <intervention id="2-440" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, as you have understood, I will be answering on behalf of my colleague Olli Rehn, who, incidentally, may have used a bit more of my time on the final response. Mrs Bowles mentioned angels. I do not know if there are many angels when we talk of financial services. I would like to say to Mrs Bowles that the devil is always in the detail, and I will respond in as much detail as possible to the questions that she has asked.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first question: what amount are we talking about when we talk of this European stabilisation mechanism? What is the link with the ceiling on own resources? Madam President, the conclusions of the Ecofin Council mention a sum of EUR 60 billion for the European financial stabilisation mechanism, but the legal limit is given in Article 2(2) of Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010, which limits loans to the margin available in the ceiling of own resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The decision on own resources limits the possibilities for the European Union budget to call for payments from own resources by the Member States to 1.23% of European Union GNI. This means that the combined total of the ceiling of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the total amount of the flow of debt services on the loans guaranteed by the European Union budget cannot exceed 1.23% during a given budgetary year. That is the precise response that Mr Rehn wanted to give to you on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second question: will the Commission carry out an impact analysis for these two instruments? According to the regulation on the European stabilisation mechanism, the Commission is required to prepare, six months after the creation of this mechanism and, if necessary, every six months, a report on its functioning. This report will be transmitted to the Economic and Financial Committee and the Council. Notably, it will include an impact evaluation of the text. As for the European Financial Stability Facility, this is an intergovernmental structure whose functioning is not subject to the evaluation requirements applicable to European Union texts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third question: what is the impact on the financial capacities of the EIB? The European stabilisation mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility will have no direct impacts on the borrowing and financing activities of the EIB. The EIB will only manage liquidities, provide logistical support and carry out certain back office functions for the European financial stabilisation mechanism. It will not lend or borrow on behalf of this mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fourth question: when will there be a legislative proposal for permanent crisis management on sovereign debt, and on what legal basis? Madam President, the Commission is working on potential proposals in close cooperation with the working group presided over by President Van Rompuy. No exact choice of legal basis has yet been made. You have just mentioned the question of the role of the European Parliament. The European Parliament will be kept informed of any change regarding all of these new procedures. The legal nature of the European Parliament’s participation will depend on the legal basis of the legislative proposals, as provided for by the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The sixth question: what is the coordination with the International Monetary Fund? The political conditions for a potential programme of aid to a Member State will be decided by a joint agreement with the International Monetary Fund when there is a joint package from the European financial stabilisation mechanism and the IMF, as is usually the case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The seventh question, which you went into some detail on: how should we respond to the potential needs of countries which are not members of the euro area? Member States not participating in the euro can, if necessary, appeal to the existing rules on assistance with balance of payments. Last year, the ceiling for the aid which can be given through this facility was increased by EUR 25 billion to EUR 50 billion, of which EUR 15 billion has already been committed for loans to Hungary, Latvia and Romania. In addition, the conditions on borrowing relating to the rules on balance of payments are more favourable than those established by the rules on the European financial stabilisation mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The eighth and final question relates to the choice of legal bases. Article 122(2) of the treaty has been used as the legal basis of the rules for this financial stabilisation mechanism, because the Commission and the Council have acted in emergencies in which a number of Member States were seriously threatened by grave difficulties caused by exceptional events outside their control. The Commission and the Council, which were placed under extreme pressure, in particular from the financial markets, had to act very quickly to safeguard the euro. This would have been difficult to reconcile with a long procedure involving an important role for some national parliaments. I would add that the European Parliament itself, Madam President, had called on the Commission, in a resolution adopted in April 2009, to adopt a regulation on financial aid to Member States on the basis of Article 122.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the most detailed reply I can give to Mrs Bowles on the basis of the detailed questions that she put.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, unfortunately I am unable to go into detail now on the disregard for parliamentary rights and the basis for the safety net. However, I wish to say the following on the subject. In our view, the financial stabilisation mechanism is not a substitute for developing a European monetary fund. I believe that we need a European bank levy which should be used, primarily, to raise the necessary capital for a European rating agency and, secondly, to develop a European monetary fund.</p>
      <p sl="de">The financial stabilisation mechanism illustrates the urgency of financial market reforms. However, it also indicates a lack of any crisis mechanism, as well as the fact that we need a political, economic and social union, and a stronger Europe in general.</p>
      <p sl="de">The best stabilisation mechanism, in my view, is to comply with the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact, implement the internal market and devise a competition policy based on a dynamic education, research and investment campaign, so that we can achieve growth and employment without us having to dip into taxpayers’ pockets in an emergency.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, without doubt, the decision taken on 9 May to create the European financial stabilisation mechanism was of crucial importance in protecting the single currency and the stability of the euro area in general. That is why Parliament, which asked the Council to proceed in that direction a long time ago, immediately welcomed it.</p>
      <p sl="el">That decision, like the decision to create a European Financial Stability Facility, finally sent an – albeit belated – message of unity and solidarity in the euro area to the international markets. The European Central Bank demonstrated the same willingness and solidarity in its decision on temporary intervention in the secondary bond market, a practice which is fully in keeping with the more general spirit of the decision by the finance ministers in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, these are mechanisms and measures of a provisional nature and, if we really want to learn lessons from the current crisis, obviously we should not wait for the next crisis to highlight the shortcomings and weaknesses in the euro area and the Union before we decide to intervene. Now is the right time to create permanent economic coordination and supervision mechanisms that will function as both prevention and cure.</p>
      <p sl="el">Within this framework, the recent Commission communication on stronger economic coordination is certainly a move in the right direction, but we should not forget that our basic objective is the stable and viable recovery of the European economy and that is why we need a framework of economic governance which focuses not solely on the pillar of financial restructuring, but also on protecting employment and on growth and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="el">In order to achieve this, our priority should not be sanctions; it should be incentives and preventive measures which will safeguard equal treatment for all the Member States of the Union and their citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, as you know, in this Parliament, we were very happy that solidarity has finally been introduced, even if some of us regretted that this was done many months after the initiative by President Van Rompuy to convene an extraordinary European Council on these questions on 11 February. In the meantime, the markets have done their job.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While we address this European solidarity initiative, I believe that we must also look at where we are coming from and recognise that, if this situation has been created, it is because we do not really have the right elements in place in terms of the governance of the euro area. Our fellow Member, Othmar Karas, spoke of the Stability Pact. It seems to me that the simple application of the Stability Pact is not enough, and that fundamentally, we have, from the start, underestimated these risks of divergence on the evaluation of the sovereign debt ratings of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we have a mechanism that was put together in an emergency, as you reminded us. You also reminded us that, in this Parliament, since October 2008 – that is, since the implementation of the facility concerning the balance of payments – some people have spoken up to ask that Article 122 be looked into. We did this in an emergency. Emergency is never the best counsel, and you mentioned that you would study the potential proposal for making such a mechanism permanent. I hope that you will come forward with more attacking proposals in this area, because we are sure that an area like the euro area does not just need good governance to avoid such situations arising in future, but should this happen, it also needs a permanent mechanism in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Next, I would simply say that I regret the fact that, rather than appealing to Eurobonds, the Member States preferred to introduce the special purpose vehicle at a time when we are also asking ourselves questions about the functioning of this type of structure in the markets.</p>

      <p sl="ro">On 9 May, Member States’ finance ministers decided to create a European financial stabilisation mechanism. This is part of a package of legislative measures envisaged to protect the euro and support the recovery of the financial situation in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the new mechanism will have to provide a prompt, well coordinated response if a state is unable to finance its public debt off its own bat. In fact, this will be able to contribute to the sustainability of the public finances of the beneficiary Member State. The EU has already responded to a crisis situation using the European financial stabilisation mechanism which it was not adequately prepared for.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to ask you the following question, Commissioner Barnier: given the temporary nature of this mechanism lasting three years and taking into account the EU’s need to respond promptly in crisis situations, when do you reckon that this mechanism will become permanent and where would the relevant sources of funding come from?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-446" speaker_id="96981" name="Franz Obermayr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, in the event of a crisis in other Member States, EU countries should now no longer bail them out with direct financial packages, as has been the case until now, but stand surety for them. This sounds a really good idea, but it does not by any means get rid of the basic problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problem is that countries in the euro area, with far-reaching differences in terms of financial policy and difficult financial policy conditions, are naturally faced with extremely tricky situations. In such cases, the problem is just shifted, and the guarantor himself is quickly made into a debtor. Besides, the issue arises concerning the dependency of rating agencies. To be able to secure capital at the lowest possible interest rate, the European Financial Stability Facility would therefore have to achieve the best rating from the rating agencies, which would make this instrument particularly dependent on US agencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Consequently, it does not make sense to create a public company, entrust it with such important duties and then put it under the huge influence of private rating agencies. However, with a European version of the agency, the question arises as to how to guarantee a neutral rating. I find, therefore, that this measure has not been thought through well enough. It poses the risk again of Member States running up debts at the expense and liability of others.</p>

    <intervention id="2-447" speaker_id="2278" name="Paul Rübig" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I am interested in the question of stabilisation and how we can achieve economic growth. My question is: given that the 2011 budget is in the midst of being negotiated, are you aware of any budget lines which can really boost employment? How can we provide better support to small and medium-sized enterprises, and how we can get more and better entrepreneurs? I believe that this is the crux of stabilisation. If we generate more profit, we can, in turn, distribute more resources and also make Europe a fairer place.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, CIP, is precisely the kind of measure which would be a huge help to us making further progress in the future. Any reduction of this programme would be totally counterproductive. During the analysis, we ought to look out for which budget lines totally discourage employment, which are neutral and which create new jobs. Would you have a suggestion to make on this?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, regarding the EIB, I think that one of the questions asked was what the conditions are in which it will be able to borrow on the markets, alongside these mechanisms which are being introduced, and if there will be an impact on interest rates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would simply like to ask you a question, Commissioner. In this context, do you not think that within the Van Rompuy working group, you or Commissioner Rehn should propose studying the idea of pooling part of the sovereign debt? This is not a proposition which is on the table, but it is much debated outside the working group. It might be worthwhile if this pooling of part of the sovereign debt were taken into account in the proposals which could be developed by this working group.</p>

    <intervention id="2-449" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, if you will allow me, I would suggest to you that Mr Rehn respond to you directly on the important question of Eurobonds, in particular, and on the final points that Mrs Berès mentioned a moment ago. He will do this in writing in the next few days.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In her initial speech, Mrs Bowles mentioned the stress tests, which are tests of resistance to events which have not yet happened, and which perhaps will not happen. We must therefore understand properly what the question is here, and in the Commission, we thought quite early on – President Barroso has expressed his feeling on this subject, as has Olli Rehn – that transparency would have great benefits. I refer you to the quite comprehensive response that President Barroso gave on this question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Karas mentioned a very important point which was raised in the preceding debate on prevention and precaution and, in particular, the idea that it is the banks that must pay for the banks, and not the taxpayers. I would like to confirm that, besides the communication that I have given on this subject, we will propose legislation at the start of 2011 which provides for the creation of these precaution or bank resolution funds to implement the principle of ‘the polluter pays’ while emphasising another idea, which I would repeat here, namely, that prevention always costs less than cure. However, this is only a tool, Mr Karas. This bank resolution fund, this tax or bank levy, is only a tool in a toolbox which contains others, the objective being to identify the risks early enough to prevent them turning into a crisis and this crisis turning into a catastrophe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the credit rating agencies, we are examining all the questions, including those of sovereign debt ratings mentioned a moment ago by Mrs Berès. I confirm that we are working on the diversification of this market, which is excessively concentrated in a few hands, and, in particular, on the possibility of a European agency. These ideas will also be turned into legislative proposals at the end of 2010 and the start of 2011. Mrs Berès mentioned the application of the Stability Pact. Like you, I think that we must go further. As you have understood, we introduced this European financial stabilisation mechanism in a time of emergency. As I said earlier on – and here I am also responding to Mrs Băsescu – we are working on more permanent mechanisms, and the Commission, together with the working group led by the President of the European Council, has not yet chosen the legal basis on which we will establish these proposals relating to a more permanent mechanism for crisis management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to conclude, Mrs Podimata, by mentioning the work that Greece has done, which you know well. We must take into account the very important commitment of the Greek Government to playing its part in this work. I would like to remind you that this recent crisis which has affected your country, though not only your country, and the risks of contagion associated with it, have provided good evidence of the interdependence of the Member States, especially in the euro area. This crisis has also emphasised, in my view, the need for Europe to demonstrate its determination to undertake fundamental reforms to ensure the smooth running of the European Union and the euro area as a whole. In its decisions on the creation of these two instruments, the Ecofin Council of 9 May plainly showed that the European Union was capable of responding quickly and efficiently to the great political and economic challenges. I believe, however, that it is clearly necessary to improve this economic and budgetary coordination, and I know that we can go beyond the word ‘coordination’ and go further when it comes to the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to say to Mr Rübig that, just like him, I think that we have learned the lessons in the current situation – and it is not over: we have spoken of supervision and we must follow through with the decisions taken relating to supervision and regulation – from the jolts on the euro and Greece, thanks to the proposals for governance and coordination and this system of response and stabilisation. The Commission has also made important proposals relating to budgetary surveillance. I think that we must do all this, but we must do even more to talk to the citizens, who expect us to deal with the economic situation, in terms of growth and employment. While on the subject of surveillance, stabilisation, efforts, regulation and rules, I think that we must also talk about initiatives in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy in order to regain growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is why, in the second part of my portfolio, I attach importance to the proposal I am working on with a dozen of my colleagues, which I will present at the start of October, on this idea of a Single Market Act in order to make the fundamental basis – the platform of the entire European economy that is the single market – work better. This is a market of 500 million citizens in which small businesses, of which there are very many, citizens and consumers are not doing well. Yet we know that if this market functioned better for small and medium-sized businesses, citizens and consumers, we could find 2% of growth in this market, in ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In summary, then, I think that we must continue with this discussion while taking the action necessary to respond to all the questions which our citizens our currently asking.</p>

    <intervention id="2-453" speaker_id="2173" name="Arlene McCarthy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, firstly, I would like to put on record my thanks to those who have helped to secure the agreement we have reached on CRD III (Capital Requirements Directive) regulating bank capital and bankers’ pay and bonuses. A very special thanks goes to my shadows in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the staff, and also to Commissioner Barnier for his continued support for the committee’s proposals, and of course, not least, to the Spanish Presidency for their persistence and efforts in 12 hours of trialogues to mediate between Parliament’s negotiating team and the 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final law we are debating today fully implements the Basel rules on capital against the trading book and re-securitisations and it robustly implements the international remuneration rules agreed at the G20. Financial experts all agree that a high risk short-term bonus culture, combined with a lack of capital, were central elements in the 2008 global financial crisis. Governments and taxpayers ended up bailing out the banking sector across the European Union with an injection of some EUR 3.9 trillion of support. In my Member State, the UK, an estimated GBP 1.2 trillion of support was extended, almost equivalent to one full year of GDP. Savers and investors saw the value of their pensions and investments decline as a result of the banks’ risky practices. The bankers walked away with the short-term profits from these risky practices, while the risks they took will remain on the banks’ books for years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new law amending the Capital Requirements Directive addresses these fundamental flaws and weaknesses in the banking system which led to the crisis. It will force banks to hold more capital against riskier activities on the trading book. The law also forces banks to reform their remuneration and bonus practices with rules that break the link between financial reward and excessive risk-taking. The effect of Parliament’s amendments is also to ensure that those remuneration policies, first and foremost, prioritise the health and stability of a financial institution and indeed, lending to the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are constantly told by the banks that they have learned the lessons of the crisis. If that is the case, why did the Bank of England financial stability report state in June that the proportion of bank revenues allocated to salaries and bonuses has, in fact, increased since the banking crisis? The extra GBP 10 billion paid out by UK banks in salaries and bonuses represents GBP 10 billion that could have been put towards banks’ capital and, as such, support, as the Bank of England makes clear, around GBP 50 billion of lending to small businesses and families. Furthermore, the Bank of England reports say that lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK has actually declined in recent months and that mortgage lending is expected to contract in the next few months.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, colleagues, at a time when governments across the EU are making substantial budget cuts, scaling back public services and support to families and businesses, we cannot continue with a banking culture that prioritises bankers’ pay and perks over sustaining capital and credit for Europe’s economic recovery. It is therefore imperative that these rules on bonuses apply in 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">These rules are deferral, in line with the business cycle with annual review clawback; tough measures for bailed-out banks; a cap on the ratio of bonus to fixed salary; payment in contingent capital alongside shares; increased transparency and accountability and improved corporate governance; and, of course, coverage of bonus-like pensions so a banker responsible for the collapse of his own bank will no longer be able to walk away with a GBP 16 million pension pot.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament has insisted on a tough interpretation of the G20 principles to ensure that the upfront cash proportion of a bonus is strictly limited. Paying a large part of the bonus in cash without any deferral or assessment of actual performance leaves, the Parliament believes, an unacceptable incentive for taking dangerous short-term risks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, we have a duty, as legislators, to defend the taxpayers’ interest. We have a duty to respond to the public’s concerns. Our voters demand and expect banks to prioritise stability and lending over bankers’ own pay and bonuses. In the last two years, since 2008, the banks have failed to reform their structures. They have failed to do this and we are now doing the job for them in order to rebuild trust and confidence in Europe’s banking system.</p>

    <intervention id="2-454" speaker_id="25718" name="Saïd El Khadraoui" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the constructive cooperation that has enabled us to establish what is, in my view, a coherent package of opinions and recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The financial crisis has made clear that remuneration policies in the financial sector have been excessively geared towards short-term profits and that this has encouraged risk-taking behaviour, with all the associated consequences for the economy as a whole in the wake of the banking crisis. In addition, the limited impact of non-binding recommendations on remuneration policies has been demonstrated, and so it is important that we lay down ground rules aiming to contribute to sustainable growth of the companies involved and of the economy as a whole. The political agreement concerning the Capital Requirements Directive just proposed by my colleague, Mrs McCarthy, is an important step forward, as it sets out, for the first time, binding provisions concerning the structure and payment of bonuses in the financial sector. The limits on payment in cash, the stipulation that there must also be the possibility of limiting bonuses in the event of underperformance, and the spreading of bonus payments over several years strike me as particularly important aspects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My report seeks to show that this is insufficient and that we need to look at remuneration policies from a broader perspective and strengthen the corporate-governance rules so that the ground rules and internal procedures for all the companies in the financial sector, on the one hand, and listed companies, on the other, meet the same criteria.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To begin with, it is important to exercise and expand sound internal and external supervision of remuneration policies. Therefore, companies should have a remuneration committee, which must be independent, and is accountable to the shareholders and supervisors, who must also be given access to all the potentially relevant information. This committee should also be able to cooperate closely with the risk committee on the evaluation of the incentives created by the compensation system. People engaged in risk control should, of course, be independent from the business units they control, be able to assert sufficient authority and be compensated independently of the performance of the business units under their supervision.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Risk management arrangements should be reviewed in detail by the supervisor, and companies should establish an internal procedure to address problems and conflicts which may occur between risk management and its operational units.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The remuneration itself must reflect the company’s long-term performance as far as possible. Bonuses should not just be guaranteed. The levels of variable remuneration should be based on predetermined and measurable performance criteria, which should be not only quantitative but also qualitative in nature. In addition, in the interests of social justice and for ethical reasons, the difference between the highest and the lowest remuneration in a company should remain reasonable. A proportion of variable remuneration should be paid out over a sufficient period. Furthermore, more than half should be paid out in shares or share-linked instruments, and effective recovery of a proportion of these bonuses must be possible. Also, an upper limit of two years’ pay should be set for severance pay, which should certainly be banned in cases of non-performance or voluntary departure.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to transparency, it is important that details of companies’ pension and supplementary pension arrangements be published and that shareholders be able to express their views on their company’s remuneration policy. We also call for the development of an international structure enabling disclosure of the individuals earning upwards of EUR 1 million, to include the main elements of salary bonuses, long-term pay and pension contributions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We call on the European Commission to continue its work and develop strict, binding principles on remuneration in the financial sector on top of those we have already agreed. We call for the establishment of a system for listed companies that provides full transparency, enabling us to find out which companies are keeping to the arrangements and which are not. I think that we can go even further in this matter. Commissioner, I am looking forward to your proposals on corporate governance, which have been announced in the Green Paper, as that is another dossier we shall certainly be continuing to work on in the coming months and years.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-455" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now debating another aspect of the response to the economic crisis, namely the lessons that can be learnt from it. After supervision has been dealt with, the next issue is how best to reform those remuneration practices which encouraged reckless risk taking, how best to reform capital requirements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding these two points, I should like to thank and congratulate your two colleagues, Mrs McCarthy and Mr El Khadraoui, the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with you, and who have demonstrated the commitment of your Parliament to a more responsible, more sound, more stable economy, to markets that should be placed once more – I repeat – at the service of the real economy, at the service of the citizens, rather than the reverse. This is an objective on which the Commission, in general, and I myself, in particular, are in full agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since my hearing, I have supported responsible European businesses, focused on the citizens, in order to improve the governance of financial institutions. I would like to thank Parliament for its support on these issues, on these tasks. I agree with your observation, Mr El Khadraoui. There must be binding measures on the remuneration policies of financial institutions. I am therefore delighted with the compromise reached by the three institutions on the revision of the directive on capital requirements, known as CRD 3. It is a balanced, well-conceived compromise which sends a strong political message to the banks and to the public.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This revised directive will strengthen the regulation system and increase the requirements for capital in areas where risks are under-capitalised. It will limit those remuneration practices which, I repeat, encouraged excessive risk taking, which have, rightly, been condemned by European citizens. It is a very important reform which tackles aspects which made a very significant contribution to the causes of the recent crisis: the trading book, complex securitisations, and remuneration practices. It is a text which not only transposes at European level the principles of the Financial Stability Board, which we agreed at the G20 in Pittsburgh, in September 2009, but which also goes beyond this by setting clear and stringent limits on variable remuneration, while allowing credit establishments and investment companies a margin of flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The payment of bonuses to directors of banks receiving State aid is greatly restricted. I think that that is fair. The clawback mechanism will also allow for a portion of the bonuses to be reimbursed in the event of under-performance. I also welcome the fact that these measures must be implemented by the Member States from 1 January 2011. I think that it is very important for the bonuses awarded in 2010, but not yet paid by 1 January 2011, to be fully covered by these new rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteurs, we shall propose corresponding rules for the other financial sectors, such as the insurance sector or investment fund sector, while showing respect for, and taking full account of, the particular features of each of these sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A few words about corporate governance in general, because beyond these aspects, Mr El Khadraoui’s report clearly illustrates how necessary it is to improve the governance of all businesses. This is one of the key elements of a more robust and more stable regulatory framework. I have begun this task. I recently put forward an international agenda for a financial regulation for growth. The Green Paper of 2 June 2010 on corporate governance in financial institutions is a first step in this direction. We are examining the role of auditors, of members of management boards, in order to check that everyone with a responsibility is fully competent to fulfil it. This is one of the requests made in your report, Mr El Khadraoui. Your report also deals with conflicts of interests, the role and function of boards of directors, risk management, the roles of shareholders, supervisory authorities and auditors in financial institutions. We shall open a two-month period of genuine consultation on all these issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also intend to undertake a study next year on corporate governance beyond the financial sector, in particular, concerning the role of shareholders, diversity, and the role of women, for example, in the composition of corporate boards of directors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, there is the matter of the modernisation of capital treatment. I have just referred to CRD 3 and the issue of remuneration. This is a different issue to those of the capital requirement for high-risk activities and the bank trading book, which are both at the root of the crisis. We now know that the current levels of capital held against these assets were totally insufficient in the face of the financial crisis. CRD 3 strengthens regulation in this area, remedies deficiencies in the ways in which capital in relation to the trading book has been calculated and considerably increases the levels of capital held against its assets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, some of you are undoubtedly concerned that these crucial reforms will not come into effect by the end of 2011. I am very aware of this risk. Nevertheless, when it became clear that the United States would not be in a position to implement the Basel Committee’s new rules on the trading book by the end of 2010, during my recent visit to the United States, I reviewed this matter with the US Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, and we reached an agreement, at international level, on a date for the application of the new rules. This international agreement was reached in May, when the Basel Committee agreed that the member countries would apply the new rules by the end of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With very flexible and internationalised markets, I think that it is extremely important to have global convergence, particularly between the Americans and the Europeans. I believe that by negotiating this deadline, we have ensured that all our international partners, chiefly the United States, will implement the rules in accordance with the amended timetable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am aware that these negotiations on CRD 3 have sometimes been very difficult. I should like, Madam President, to thank Mrs McCarthy and the shadow rapporteurs once again for the perseverance, creativity and receptiveness they have shown. I am delighted that I, my staff and my colleagues within the Directorate-General are able to work with you with such understanding.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, the financial incentives that bonuses have provided and that have affected the behaviour of stockbrokers, portfolio managers and directors in the financial sector were a major contributing factor to the financial crisis. We know what the outcome of this was, and therefore it is clearly a good thing that the directive is being amended so that we can avoid something similar happening in future. In this regard, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the new agreement and thank her for the work she has done.</p>
      <p sl="da">We actually discussed remuneration policies in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and we therefore welcome those areas of the agreement, for example, that focus on more openness and transparency in connection with the provision of information to all stakeholders, shareholders, employees, the general public and the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="da">Moreover, in the Employment Committee’s opinion, we were almost unanimously in favour of a ban on stock options. Stock options have been the bonus scheme instrument that has provided the greatest incentive to take unnecessary risks that have resulted in losses. Even the financial sector recognises this problem, and I therefore regret the fact that the agreement does not contain a ban on stock options.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is again absent. One must presume that the Council is not really aware of the political message conveyed by these regulations or by its absence.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the negotiations, the Council came out on the side of the bonus recipients. The European Parliament is in favour of clear European regulations. We are in favour of maximum limits. We are in favour of payment methods involving less risk. We are in favour of liability. We are in favour of restrictions on bonuses for managers of banks supported with public funds. We do not want cash amounts to be higher than the tied-up capital. We have managed to get our way with splitting the timetable. We are delighted that Commissioner Barnier has agreed with the Americans that the second part, the banking book and trading book, should be implemented globally together.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that we have adapted the trading book and banking book. The disclosure requirements have been clearly tightened, the inclusion of risk for re-securitisations in the trading book has been adapted to the banking book and the stress test has been introduced in the trading book to build up capital buffers for crisis periods.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that we have tightened the preventive measures against insolvency in the trading book, but on this point, I would like to mention that we need a harmonised European insolvency law on top of this. We support this compromise as it takes us further in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the area of bonuses and remuneration systems is one in which we have heard a great deal of rhetoric in recent years. On the other hand, there have been very few specific measures. It is therefore a positive move that we are now establishing legislation that is both clear and practicable. This legislation will most likely reduce the short-sighted and exaggerated risk taking in the financial sector. That will reduce the risk level and increase stability.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The financial services industry should have removed the elements of the bonus systems that are damaging to society long ago, but since this has not happened, there is nothing else we can do but legislate. It is too risky for society to largely accept the status quo. Taxpayers have already paid out too much to cover losses in banks that have taken risks that were far too high. It is now vital that the directive is implemented properly in the Member States and that the regulations are used effectively, thereby helping to change the current bonus culture.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the reform of bank capital is Europe’s most important legislative response to the crisis so far and it deserves big billing. Yes, I mean up there alongside the supervisory architecture. Under-capitalised trading books were a fundamental cause of the crisis, making speculative proprietary trading attractive and almost cost-free. So the three- to four-fold increase of capital required against such trading positions should be welcomed as directly addressing the root cause of the crisis and cutting down on the motive for casino banking.</p>
      <p sl="de">On remuneration, when I first suggested that big bonuses and pension lump sums could be paid in subordinated debt, many said that this could not fly. So I thank the rapporteur and my fellow shadows for supporting this idea, which we transformed into contingent capital and is already becoming part of mainstream thinking elsewhere. I regret that my specific tax-avoidance texts could not be included, but we have prohibited payment in ways designed to undermine the purpose of the directive.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, my political group is particularly delighted that this directive has been adopted. It is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors. I must say that the ability to strictly limit the variable remuneration of directors of banks assisted by the public purse, and even the possibility to defer up to 70% of traders’ bonuses in the long-term interests of the bank and, potentially therefore, to take account of the risks taken and the negative effects of these risks in order to reduce these bonuses, are important rules which translate the G20’s commitments in principle into real figures at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I must also say that in negotiations with all the other shadow rapporteurs and with the rapporteur herself, we constantly came up against a lack of commitment by the States, against the huge gap between fine rhetoric on the regulation of capitalism, on the raising of the moral standards of capitalism, on the one hand, and the negotiating positions of the Council and the main States, which constantly refused to agree figures, and tried to reduce the scope of and water down all of our ambitious proposals, on the other. I must say, Commissioner, that the Commission has largely been on our side in this struggle. Therefore, I think that this is an achievement which we can share.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, there is an important issue at stake. As we lost, we have had to make compromises. We lost a number of battles aimed at agreeing figures, and we have had to replace these figures with a number of words, often rather portmanteau words, such as ‘justified’, ‘appropriate’ and ‘balanced’. The challenge now is for the future European banking authority to translate these principles and portmanteau words into real figures, which will then be applied by all banks and all Member States. I would therefore like to know, Mr Barnier, how you intend to apply pressure on and strictly monitor this future process so that it does not distort the text on which we are going to vote tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we have obviously learnt something from the crisis after all, as irresponsible economic activity is now no longer to be encouraged or rewarded. The system supporting the payment of only some bonuses, in this case 20% or 30%, promotes efforts towards managing companies in a more sustainable way. The regulation should also set an example to citizens, as they have already footed enough of the bill, and it is incomprehensible why their taxes should be used to pay bonuses to irresponsible managers.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have here a regulation which is unique on a global scale. If the EU wants to avoid the possibility of emigration towards New York or Tokyo, it must now have a second trick up its sleeve, which means pushing more strongly for a common regulation on the international stage. After all, any managers who are successful and responsible also want to continue making a good living.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, it might be worth considering applying corporate governance requirements which do not affect the capping of executive pay, even in companies not listed on the stock exchange. This is a fundamental change towards greater sustainability and cost efficiency, and hopefully away from gambling.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it seems to me we have been able to do something very significant in regulating or creating a new framework for remuneration policy. On the one hand, we have managed to agree that the escalation of remuneration was one factor which helped cause the financial crisis. We have also been able to agree with each other that we have to increase the role of management bodies and particularly of supervisory bodies, including both internal and external supervision in companies. We have also agreed that general principles have to be established for situations when a completely independent management committee has to be formed in a company. We have finally managed to agree what previous speakers have talked about, that bonuses should be linked to long-term financial results and that they can be set aside.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We were also able to agree with something else, which seems to me no less important – we were able to agree that remuneration policy, although undoubtedly incorrect, was not the main cause, and certainly not the only cause, of the financial crisis. I welcome this last point in particular, because if we had written this into the report – and there were such suggestions – we would have accepted information which is simply not true, and this would not have helped us fight the causes of the crisis.

      <p sl="sv">After the extensive financial crisis, it is probably only natural for us to review remuneration policy within this sector. At the same time, we have to admit that the issue has, without a doubt, been politically interesting and quite simply populistic. It is clear that we need principles that promote and create guidelines for a sound remuneration policy. We know that there have been individual cases where remuneration policy could have given rise to the problems that we have seen over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, we must avoid broad generalisations and blaming the sector as a whole. We should perhaps remember that it is hardly in the interests of an individual company to encourage exaggerated risk taking. I am therefore also pleased that we were finally able to agree on the comply-or-explain principle, among other things. In the end, we succeeded in achieving a relatively balanced result. I believe this is a good result, even though I think that as politicians, we should perhaps, in principle, not go into as much detail as we are doing in this case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Karas has already mentioned some key points. I fully concur with him on them. I think that we need better capital requirements for financial institutions in both qualitative and quantitative terms. One thing is therefore certain, namely that the Basel rules need to be developed further. However, it does not help to force the situation as this could have totally the opposite effect.</p>
      <p sl="de">The financial crisis is obviously a global crisis. The lessons we need to draw from it must therefore be drawn at a global level as well. This means that if we tighten capital requirements, we must coordinate this measure internationally too. The level playing field must be retained. Judging in particular by the decisions that have been made in the last few days by our friends in the US, I have certain doubts about this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another consideration, which is especially important to me, is that the accumulation of current projects must not result in inconsistency. For example, texts and annexes must remain consistent. Calculation examples in the annex must also match the wording. However, the future supervisory authority will be responsible for the interpretation.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one other thing we should not forget. The financial economy and the real economy are not two self-contained systems. Capital requirement regulations have an impact on the real economy. However, at the moment we do not know exactly what this will be. We therefore need at least to carry out thorough impact assessments before we make any further changes to the legal framework. This has been the negotiating line adopted by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) from the outset. The compromise which has now been reached with the Council is therefore, in my view, the only sensible solution. I wish to thank Mrs McCarthy and Mr Karas, in particular, for the work they have put in to this report.</p>

The restriction on bonuses to top managers is a very important sign: first of all, because it is the first time, anywhere in the world, that a ceiling on payments to bank directors has been established; secondly, because this is a package of clear rules – managers’ bonuses must only be paid when the bank has collected the profits and no longer only on the basis of forecast results; and thirdly, because the new measures will put an end to the encouragement to take excessive risks.

      <p sl="sk">Inappropriate systems of remuneration contributed to excessive and careless risk taking at the expense of employees, savers, investors and overall economic growth, which finally also contributed to the financial and economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For this reason, I welcome the initiative leading to the regulation of remuneration policies in the financial services sector, which takes account of the fact that managers are often led by their own financial interests when managing a company.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Excessive risk taking is also, in many cases, contrary to the long-term interests of a company and its shareholders. In the case of banks and other financial institutions, moreover, taxpayers are faced with the risk that they will have to take part in rescue measures in case of financial difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, there is a real wave of post office closures at the moment in Austria while, at the same time, there has been a 40% wage hike at Post AG, but only for executive salaries. However, particularly during times of crisis, the general population is unable to comprehend such fantasy salaries, bonus excesses and serial severance pay recipients. It will not be that easy to put an end to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is well known that the German law on the appropriateness of management board remuneration has simply brought about more red tape and greater influence from foreign investors on remuneration policy and company strategy. The attempt to make management executives more accountable with retentions was thwarted by new insurance policies. The EU draft should draw a lesson from this.</p>
      <p sl="de">When one hears that disclosure of managers’ salaries in the US has led to their increase, it becomes clear that our plan is tantamount to fighting against a hydra. A chief controller will, at any rate, find it difficult to be responsible for two companies at the same time which compete with each other.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Commission. This is a specialist area but every single citizen in Europe is pleased that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are tackling the issue of excessive remuneration. We only know about the excesses of the banking sector because of the disasters that have happened. I would argue that, even if things were profitable in banking, the remuneration is way out of line from the general public perception.</p>
      <p sl="en">Transparency is the key to all of this. When people have knowledge of what is happening, then we can take action on it. We published the payments of farmers, from the very smallest right up through the chain, and we regard this as transparent. In my view, bankers make profits from public money, from their shareholders and those of us who take out loans, so it is time to tackle this particular problem. I am not, however, convinced that the mindset of many bankers has changed at all and I fear that when this does eventually blow over, unless the Commission is very strong, we will revert to type.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am deeply touched that you still have the patience to listen to me as I have been with you for four hours now, and I am delighted to be here, to answer your questions and to listen to your debate on some very important matters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, my thanks go to Mrs McCarthy and Mr El Khadraoui and to all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their commitment, their contributions, and the important improvements that you, the rapporteurs, have made to these texts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We still have a great deal of work to do on the issue of the financial sector, on remuneration in the other financial sectors, on corporate governance, on CRD 4, on derivatives and on short selling, and I shall propose some regulations on these areas in September.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Only today, the College approved two legislative texts on deposit guarantees and compensation for investors, and a White Paper on guarantees in the insurance sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To return to today’s texts, on which you will vote tomorrow, I think they are sound texts which have benefited from a considerable number of contributions in the course of the negotiation process, from positive amendments, tabled by your committee, in particular, concerning details on the calculation of remuneration, transparency in remuneration policies, restrictions on bonuses in those companies which have benefited from State aid, and clawback.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to international competitiveness, I would like to remind you that the Financial Stability Board’s remuneration principles are general principles designed for states, which differ considerably in terms of their economic development. There is considerable diversity amongst these states and, where the Financial Stability Board’s general principles allowed them too much room for manoeuvre as regards the implementation of those principles, it was indeed necessary, at European level, to ensure that the Member States implemented the text of the directive consistently. Clear rules have been implemented which cannot be interpreted in different ways. As I have already said on numerous occasions, I do not believe that a clear, consistent legislative framework would in any way compromise our international competitiveness. I even believe that if Europe becomes one of the very first continents to implement these intelligent regulations and intelligent supervision, it will enjoy a competitive advantage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to what you were saying about the workings of the new European authorities, we still need to establish these authorities. They have not yet been established. This is the aim of the debates we are having with the Council at this very moment. In my view, these new authorities will have to have real powers of coordination and be able to ensure that these common rules are applied coherently and consistently. Furthermore, there must be the opportunity to take decisions relating directly to institutions, in the event that European law is not applied correctly. This includes, Mr Canfin, decisions on rules relating to remuneration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, I assure you that the Commission will be extremely vigilant as regards these various points in the coming days.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now like to say a few words about the application of these new rules. They must apply to all investment banking firms. The directive includes a general principle of proportionality, which allows for the application of the principles to be adapted to different credit institutions, taking into account their legal structure, size, complexity and the nature of their activity. We firmly believe that CRD 3, thanks to you, will make significant changes to practices which have been all too frequent until now, and which have led to excessive risk taking by the banks and hence to the economic crisis, the consequences of which we are suffering today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to thank Mr Karas for his support on the issue of implementation, as agreed, in parallel with the US, in respect of insolvency law. We shall work on this issue within the framework of the programme for resolving the crisis, but it is a long-term project.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Christensen, you stressed the need for transparency. This is a very important point on which the European Parliament still has a great deal to do to improve the Commission’s original proposals, and I thank you for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Bowles mentioned the central issue of capitalisation, as did Mr Balz a short while ago. Capitalisation is indeed important. However, I think that an appropriate internal and external supervisory framework, which we are also debating, is equally important. Regarding CRD 4, which is under discussion with the banks, I must tell you, Mr Balz, that I am extremely anxious to carry through to the end and with great care the impact and macro-economic studies that we need in order to adjust the measures contained in CRD 3 and CRD 4. There is the adjustment within the Basel measures themselves, there is the adjustment between the Basel measures and the other measures relating to precaution and prevention, internal and external supervision, corporate governance, resolution funds and the range of tools for precautionary purposes, and then there is the final adjustment, with regard to which I am very vigilant – I say this one last time, by way of conclusion – which is a confident but clear-sighted adjustment between what the United States is doing and must do, on the one hand, and what we ourselves must do from a European point of view, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to achieve exactly the same objectives. They have been set by the G20. We must achieve them in parallel, and I shall be careful to ensure that this does indeed happen.</p>

Therefore, Commissioner, I am delighted to hear that you are in favour of a corporate governance regulatory framework for all companies, and I gather that there is to be an in-depth discussion on this with stakeholders in the coming months.

      <p sl="en">The first part of Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines’ question refers to whether the procedure for the selection of the JTI’s senior executive managers guarantees independence from the influence of large companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The answer is ‘yes’. The procedure for selecting the executive directors for joint technology initiatives follows the guidelines for the appointment of heads of community agencies and joint undertakings. The guidelines are applied to all EU bodies and hence ensure that JTI selection processes are fully coherent with those of other EU bodies such as executive agencies and regulatory agencies. In this way, the process for all EU bodies, including JTIs, is based on competence and merit and guarantees equal treatment to all candidates.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this respect, as was prescribed in the guidelines, Commission senior staff members were a majority both in the pre-selection committees and during the proceedings of the Consultative Committee on Appointments. These are the only two steps of the procedure where industry was given a role in one way or the other, apart from the indirect role of industry representatives when they cast their vote in the governing board at the moment of the appointment itself, which is among candidates shortlisted by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is to be noted that the running and operational costs of all JTIs are partially covered by industry, up to 67% in the case of ENIAC and ARTEMIS, the two joint technology initiatives in the field of nanotechnologies and embedded computer systems. This implies that their involvement was necessary and in keeping with the nature of JTIs as public-private partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second part of the question asks whether in those selection processes, the EU commitment to supporting SMEs is taken into account. The answer is that, generally, staff selection criteria for the day-to-day operation of the JTI must be based – as mentioned earlier regarding the guidelines for appointment – on competence and merit. In this respect, the promotion of SMEs is an important political objective of the Commission but may not easily translate into selection criteria for the appointment of staff covered by the EU Staff Regulations such as JTI staff.</p>
      <p sl="en">The executive director and his or her staff are covered by professional ethics principles in the EU Staff Regulations and thus, they are not allowed to defend or represent any specific interest, be it SMEs or large companies. The EU Staff Regulations foresee disciplinary procedures for breaches of this obligation. Having said that, the regulations establishing the joint technology initiatives cater for SMEs. They contain provisions encouraging and promoting SME participation and representation at governing board level.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Parliament and the Commission share this concern, but, Commissioner, specific cases are taking us in the opposite direction. We know that joint technology initiatives (JTI) are ‘common bodies’ and that they therefore have a selection procedure that must be followed. We also know that elected individuals must not come directly from companies within which they have seats on the board of directors.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let me describe an actual case. For the hydrogen JTI, with its budget of EUR 470 million, the European Commission went through a selection procedure that ended up with three people, and finally with one, who was a Commission expert originating from the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, but who, upon joining the board of directors of the hydrogen JTI, was replaced by someone originating from a large company, specifically Toyota Daimler.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this specific case completely contradicts the answer that you gave me, which should be logical in relation to the procedure. I would therefore ask, Commissioner, that you monitor the selection procedure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Certainly I would be prepared to keep a close eye, as you have asked, on this issue. I think that it should be noted that the running and the operational costs of all the joint technology initiatives are partially covered by industry. In line with that contribution, and in the spirit of a public-private partnership, some involvement of industry partners is foreseen in the guidelines for the appointment of the executive director.</p>
      <p sl="en">This involves a prominent role, of course, for the Commission’s senior staff – who are always a majority in the selection process. The involvement of industry was of two kinds. Perhaps it would be helpful if I outlined how that was. One member out of three in each pre-selection committee (with voting rights) and the other two members are: the director-general from the parent directorate-general from within the Commission or one of his/her deputies as chairperson, and a director of the parent directorate-general. There is one observer from industry in the consultative committee on appointments (without voting rights); and the six members of the consultative committee on appointments are senior Commission staff members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three out of the six industry representatives on the governing board of the fuel cells and hydrogen JTI, which appoints its executive director, come at present from SMEs. That SME representation in the governing board is actually enshrined in the fuel cells and hydrogen regulation which reads that ‘at least one of the representatives to the Governing Board appointed by the Industry Grouping shall represent SMEs’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, as I said at the beginning, I will be quite happy, as the Member of Parliament asked me to do, to keep a close eye on these procedures in the future.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 16 by Joanna Senyszyn (H-0331/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European Union accession to the European Convention on Human Rights</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has recently delivered several rulings regarding legal provisions in Poland which are in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Hitherto, the question of how ECHR rulings are implemented by EU Member States which are also members of the Council of Europe has been a matter for each individual Member State. Will the anticipated accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights alter this situation and, in particular, are there any plans to introduce EU mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of ECHR rulings by Member States of the European Union which are also members of the Council of Europe?</p>

      <p sl="en">Accession of the European Union to the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will not affect the manner in which a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights against an EU Member State is executed by that Member State. That means that the accession agreement can only create obligations on the basis of the convention and, where applicable, of any additional protocol of the convention which the Union might ratify insofar as it concerns acts and measures adopted by the institutions, bodies, officers or agencies of the Union, but not when it concerns acts and measures adopted by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are no plans to introduce any EU mechanism for monitoring the implementation of such rulings, since there is no legal basis for doing so. Indeed, Protocol No 8 to the Lisbon Treaty states that accession will ‘not affect the competences of the Union or the powers of its institutions’ or ‘the situation of Member States in relation to the European Convention’. This relates not only to the scope of the substantive obligations of Member States, but also to the manner in which a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights against an EU Member State is executed.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I have a supplementary question related to rulings of the Court concerning breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, the case of Lautsi v. Italy. In a judgment passed on 3 November 2009, the Court held that hanging crucifixes in classrooms is a violation of human rights, and on 15 June 2010, in the case of Grzelak v. Poland, it held that the lack of opportunity for a schoolboy to attend lessons in ethics in the majority of Polish schools is also a violation of human rights. Is the Polish legislation, which was held by the Court to be at fault in these two cases, also at variance with the draft …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will try to answer the question. Where Member States act in the scope of Union law, they must respect fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter and in the general principles of Union law. Any violation of this obligation may lead to an infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this is the only procedural means that the European Union has at its disposal to ensure the compliance of a Member State with fundamental rights. Conversely, where Member States act outside the scope of Union law, there is no general competence under the treaties in the area of fundamental rights. Therefore, the Union is precluded not only from monitoring in general whether a Member State respects fundamental rights, but also from monitoring whether a Member State complies with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

One of the most important questions in this process will be that of the relationship between the European Court of Justice and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Politically, and in terms of real commitment to fundamental rights, it makes no sense and it runs completely counter to Articles 6 and 7 of the treaty, which say the EU and its Member States will obey the convention. Indeed, a mechanism was put into Article 7 to try to make sure that Member States do not breach human rights, so how is what the Commission said compatible with the mechanism under Article 7?</p>

      <p sl="en">I confirm that last year, the Commission presented to the Council a proposal for an agreement between the European Union and its Member States and the Principality of Liechtenstein to combat fraud and any other illegal activity and to ensure exchange of information in tax matters. In addition, the Commission has presented to the Council a draft mandate to open negotiations on similar agreements with Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland.</p>
      <p sl="en">Both the draft agreement with the Principality of Liechtenstein and the draft mandate are still pending in the Council, as some Member States have political reservations and link those files with the revision of the EU Savings Directive. I believe that these draft agreements and mandates should not be held hostage to the Saving Directive revision, as their objective is to fight against fraud at a time when there is an even more urgent need to protect our common financial interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has no specific information indicating the main third countries in which European funds choose to set up offshore companies in order to evade taxes. However, it is my conviction that the proposed agreements will contribute to improving the flow of this kind of information and they are essential tools to promote the policy of good governance in the tax area, which is built along the three following principles: transparency, exchange of information and freer tax competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective of this policy is not to target tax havens per se but to reach an agreement with as many third countries as possible on the common principles of cooperation and transparency. The ECOFIN Council has endorsed these principles and has recognised the need to promote them on as broad a geographical basis as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft agreement with the Principality of Liechtenstein and the draft mandate for negotiations with four other jurisdictions constitute prime examples of a coherent EU approach. They provide a multilateral framework for minimum rules on exchange of information and assistance between all the parties, which should enable EU Member States and third countries to combat tax fraud and evasion more effectively. But the Commission is doing more to promote its policy of transparency, exchange of information and freer tax competition in its relations with third countries. This is pursued, notably through initiatives such as the enhancement of administrative cooperation, the code of conduct on corporate taxation or the communication tax and development, cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters, which address relations with third countries. The Commission is also very active, together with its Member States, within international organisations such as the OECD, notably in the global forum on exchange of information and its peer review process.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear from what happens in practice and from what you have told us today that the Member States cannot deal effectively with this very important problem with their own control mechanisms alone. Of course, it goes without saying that this form of tax evasion seriously damages growth and leads to flows of funds not on the basis of the criterion of return, but on how best to evade taxes.</p>
      <p sl="el">There is another approach, as adopted in Spain and the United States of America, where controls of deposits are more relaxed and thus, these tax havens become less attractive. Of course, be that as it may, that cannot be applied in Member States which have no effective control mechanisms, because it results in loss of revenue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Well, first of all, I should say that when negotiating with third countries, namely the countries which I mentioned, we negotiate on behalf of the 27 Member States and we take a multilateral approach in negotiating issues relating to tax evasion. Your point is a really interesting one and we are looking at various forms of tax evasion. As you rightly pointed out, tax evaders are adjusting to the changes in our controls; that is why we have this Code of Conduct Group where we try to ensure that the code is applied not just at Member State level; we also try to encourage third countries to apply the principles of this code of conduct. This could also allow us to make progress in dealing with tax evasion.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">In the Commission’s view, what are the chances of cross-border cooperation and development in the southern Serbia – Macedonia – Kosovo border region and, in particular, in the Presevo Valley, which belongs to Serbia and is inhabited by Albanians?

      <p sl="en">The European Commission is indeed aware of the situation and the worrying economic conditions in the southern Serbian region, including the Presevo valley area. Historically, the area has been underdeveloped and is currently the poorest in Serbia. The Commission has been providing significant financial assistance since 2000.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objectives are to reduce the disparity between southern Serbia and the rest of the country in terms of living conditions and public services, and to ensure that the area plays a full part in the state institutions with responsibility for planning, future investment and their implementation. Concerning cross-border cooperation, under the IPA instrument for the pre-accession assistance programme for the region to which the question refers, this will depend on future progress in the relationship between the partners concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, the European Union will continue to encourage and support the rule of law, investment infrastructure and local border traffic in this region through the instruments it has at its disposal. These instruments include the EULEX Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo and the activities which the European Union supports under the annual IPA programmes for Serbia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as Kosovo is concerned, the Commission’s October 2009 communications on Kosovo included a number of important proposals which the General Affairs Council, December 2009, asked us to take forward. As a result, Kosovo will effectively start to benefit from the European Union financed cross-border cooperation project later this year. The Commission will mobilise IPA component II for Kosovo-Albania and for Kosovo-the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2010, this year. We intend to include Kosovo-Montenegro as well, starting next year.</p>

      <p sl="en">On this particular issue, I have to say that the problem of the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot sportsmen and women should be solved through an internal Cypriot dialogue, through ongoing talks to find the comprehensive solutions I referred to earlier.</p>
      <p sl="en">The United Nations framework offers an opportunity for such talks. The European Union has no competence to intervene in such cases. Ultimately, this regrettable situation results from the yet to be resolved Cyprus problem. The Commission strongly supports the leaders of the two communities in Cyprus in the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus, as I said earlier.</p>
      <p sl="en">A swift solution to the Cyprus issue would effectively address the problem raised by the honourable Member, but I can add that the Turkish Cypriot sportsmen and women should have the right to decide freely for which federation they want to be active. There should be no pressure from any side. As mentioned earlier, this is an issue for internal Cypriot dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 22 by Gay Mitchell (H-0329/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Middle East Peace</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Despite our proximity to the Middle East and efforts to coordinate a united foreign policy, the European Union remains a peripheral player in efforts to move along the peace process between the Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How is the Commission using the European Neighbourhood policy to bring positive results to bear on this situation?</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Union is a major actor in the Middle East peace process, both politically and practically. At a political level, the European Union’s role is founded on strong bilateral relations with all partners in this important region. The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has provided the framework for these bilateral relations, which can be tailored to each country’s needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">ENP meetings provide a platform for regular, in-depth and robust discussion of various issues, including those relating to the Middle East peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has used ENP meetings with Israel and the Palestinians to address different aspects: political issues, discussions of specific human rights cases, the situation on the ground, our assistance work, etc. In each case, the ENP framework has helped to consolidate a regular flow of information and sharing of views.</p>
      <p sl="en">At a practical level, the European Union designs its substantial support for this region as a result of bilateral consultations in the ENP framework. For example, the European Union is a major contributor to Palestinian state-building efforts and to relief efforts for the refugee population throughout the Middle East. In parallel to close bilateral relations, the European Union has consistently supported a multilateral approach to the Middle East peace process. The Union for the Mediterranean offers another forum where the Middle East Peace Process can be discussed by all partners in this region.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the European Union – along with the United States, Russia and the United Nations – is a member of the Quartet, which is supporting the current proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinians. At its meeting of 19 March 2010, the Quartet indicated that a peace deal covering all final status issues should be completed within 24 months.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply. Is the Commissioner not concerned that the Arab states in the Middle East constantly fail to meet their commitments to humanitarian aid in the region? They have only done this once – I think in the mid-1980s – in the last 20 years, while hard-pressed taxpayers in the European Union are meeting commitments in difficult times. What have you done to raise this question?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I understand from Mr Ging’s evidence yesterday from UNRWA to the joint committees, led by the Development Committee, that the efforts by non-governmental organisations did succeed in bringing to bear pressure on the Israeli Government in the area of humanitarian aid, which we have singularly failed to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know what the outcome is going to be – it will be a two-state approach and we have the road map, but do we not need new ways of communicating our message to both the Israelis and the Palestinians in the region?</p>

The Middle East peace process, and this particular region, is indeed an area over which we cooperate closely with Cathy Ashton, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission.

Yet this morning, we heard from John Ging, the director of operations for UNRWA, that in practice, although food is now being allowed in by Israel, people cannot afford to buy it because nothing is being allowed in for commerce or business to create the employment and the job prospects to give them sufficient income.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think Israel’s policy has been regarded by many of us as deceitful.

      <p sl="en">Respect for human rights and fundamental values and adherence to democratic standards are at the heart of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The Commission has been monitoring the implementation of the EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia action plans since 2006, when the action plans were signed. This monitoring is recorded in the Commission’s annual progress report, which we issue every spring.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the case of Azerbaijan, last year’s assessment indicates an uneven development in the field of democratisation and human rights. We have noted some positive developments but we continue to be concerned in particular about freedom of expression and freedom of media, an assessment which the European Parliament shared in its resolution of 17 December 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Georgia, in 2009, the country made good progress in the implementation of the ENP action plan priorities, especially in the areas of rule of law, reform of the justice system, good governance and the fight against corruption. The issues of human rights are being discussed regularly through the EU-Georgia Human Rights Dialogue which met twice in 2009 and will, in fact, meet again this week in Tbilisi to review progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is following developments in both countries, including in relation to commitments taken in the context of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The Commission continues to raise its concerns with the administration of Azerbaijan and Georgia at various levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission assesses progress in its annual reports on the implementation of the action plans agreed with the partner countries. The financial locations for ENP partners through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument will, from next year, reflect in an objective and transparent manner the degree to which the values underpinning the ENP in the area of democratic governance and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are effectively shared.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with the approach that neighbourhood policy is about reform for reforms. The more our partners are committed to reforms, the more active the Commission is in supporting that country and ensuring that reforms are adopted and implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you look at the countries participating in the Eastern Partnership, you can see that this policy is actually working. We have the same set of instruments – the Association Agreement, the Economic Integration Agreement and a method for dealing with mobility and visa-related issues. If you look at the participants in the Eastern Partnership, you can see a big difference in their attitude to reforms and in the Commission’s attitude to those countries. I could cite Moldova as a good example – the country with which we have actually started negotiations on an accession agreement, with which we have started the dialogue on visas, and with which, I hope, we will very soon also start negotiations on the Economic Integration Agreement, otherwise known as deep and comprehensive free trade agreements.</p>

      <p sl="en">Fair Trade-type schemes – or ‘private sustainability assurance schemes’, to give them their proper, though rather cumbersome, label – have an important role to play in promoting development and informing customer choice. One of their biggest assets is that they are non-governmental in nature. As expressed in the Commission’s May 2009 communication on these schemes, governmental involvement should be limited so as not to interfere with the dynamic nature of Fair Trade and the manifestation of consumer preference.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also recognise that there is considerable scope for consumer confusion. That is why the Commission is supportive of the efforts of bodies such as the ISEAL Alliance, the International Trade Centre and UNCTAD to provide more clarity on the sustainability criteria used for different schemes.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission, responsibility for Fair Trade-type schemes is shared between different Commissioners depending on the initiative in question. Thus, for example, the services of Commissioners Tajani and Barnier have taken the lead in the preparation of the guide to socially responsible procurement. Those of Commissioner Dalli lead on informing EU consumers, and those of Commissioner Piebalgs lead when it comes to projects in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">DG TRADE currently plays a central coordinating role to ensure that EU policy initiatives are coherent and consistent with the 2009 communication, and I am prepared to maintain that coordinating role in line with the commitment taken by my predecessors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Indeed, very briefly, because this is a subject which we could discuss at length. Let me just say that the negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Colombia and Peru were indeed finalised recently, but the agreement has not yet been formally initialled.</p>
      <p sl="en">The text of the agreement is currently subject to legal review in order to ensure coherence and correspondence of the two negotiated texts in English and in Spanish. This is likely to end in the autumn of this year, and, once the final texts are initialled by the negotiators, the Commission will submit them to Council for signature and conclusion of the FTA.</p>
      <p sl="en">The FTA will be formally submitted by the Council to the European Parliament for its consent after the adoption of the Council decision for its signature. At this stage, it is difficult to predict the exact date for this, but it is likely to take place in the second half of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not yet clear whether the national parliaments would also be called on to approve the agreements. The Commission will examine whether Member States’ ratification is necessary as soon as the final text of the FTA is consolidated, taking into account the new distribution of competences between the EU and the Member States resulting from the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can confirm that the agreement with Colombia and Peru includes a broad clause on human rights. As this clause constitutes an essential element of our relationship, it can therefore lead in case of breach to the unilateral suspension of trade preferences without prior consultation. Such suspension would be made through a decision taken under qualified majority by the Council on the basis of a proposal either by the Commission or the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, pursuant to Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.</p>

We are going to continue to monitor this very closely.</p>
      <p sl="en">With respect to the question by David Martin, yes, we have made that assessment. In the end, it is a political assessment. You know what the remedies are; they are the right ones.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report drawn up by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the common position adopted by the Council at first reading with a view to adopting the European Parliament and Council Regulation on novel foods, amending Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 258/97 and Regulation (EC) No 1852/2001 of the Commission (rapporteur: Kartika Tamara Liotard) (11261/3/2009 - C7-0078/2010 - 2008/0002(COD)) (A7-0152/2010).</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I, too, should like to extend warm thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and fellow Members, both present and absent, for their really tremendous cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In my opinion, the objective of the novel foods regulation should ultimately extend beyond merely food-safety aspects, as other aspects, too, are important to consumers in today’s society. Examples are environmental aspects, animal welfare aspects and ethical objections. Indeed, we often hold discussions here on food that has been tinkered with. Innovation is all well and good, but not at the expense of human life and health. Fortunately, a large majority of Parliament agrees with me on this, and I hope that we can also win over the Council.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What exactly are ‘novel foods’? Well, these are products that were not on the EU market before 15 May 1997 because they had not yet been invented or were not yet recognised as food in the EU, for example. One example of this is nanotechnology. The manufacturers would like to place this on the market. Consumers always love novelty, and indeed new technologies can help us combat obesity, for example. On the other hand, we must be extremely careful about authorising new technologies if we do not know for certain that they are harmless to health, the environment and animal welfare. One of my starting points, therefore, is that the precautionary principle must always apply when novel foods are placed on the market. A food should not reach our plates unless its safety is guaranteed. In addition, consumers must always have a choice and so, if the food is a novel food, this should be stated on the label.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now for the stumbling block: meat from cloned animals and their offspring. Research has shown that consumers are spending more and more money on animal products produced using methods respectful of animal welfare. Cloned animals are often crippled or diseased, and most are not even alive when they are born. In other words, there is little sign of respect for animal welfare. So far, cloning of animals for human consumption is not commercial practice in the EU, but the possibility that imported meat from cloned animals is already on our tables can no longer be ruled out. There are no specific EU rules for either cloned meat or the placing on the market of semen from cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The discussion on cloned meat is not new. The European Parliament has been debating the cloning of animals since back in 2006. In 2008, it adopted a resolution by Mr Parish seeking to regulate the trade in meat from cloned animals. However, the talks with the Council on that report made it clear that that call by Parliament would not be answered. The Council took the view that meat from cloned animals should fall under novel foods legislation. Therefore, Parliament was unable to reach agreement with the Council at second reading. If Parliament were to give its assent to meat from cloned animals being dealt with under novel foods legislation, it would be giving indirect assent for cloned meat to reach our tables.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, the main focus of the novel foods legislation will be on safety for consumption, and there will be much less emphasis on animal welfare and ethical aspects. Therefore, I make an emphatic call for separate legislation on the cloning of animals. Time is short, as the trade in meat and semen from cloned animals was approved in the United States a few months ago. Without a European position, there is a high likelihood of meat or semen from cloned animals finding its way onto the EU market unnoticed and unhindered. I can only hope that Parliament will remain just as firm on this point as it has been over the last three years. We must not produce any unpleasant surprises at the last moment. After all, as a politician, it is damned difficult to explain to voters why – without a public debate on the subject – we are serving up meat from cloned animals on the tables of our consumers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in March 2009, Parliament voted on the novel foods proposal at first reading. Many of the amendments that were carried have been incorporated into the Council position that was adopted at first reading in March 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council position maintains the principle of the need for pre-market authorisation for innovative products to reassure consumers that new production techniques are safe for humans and animals and respect both the interests of consumers and the environment. The proposed procedure would streamline and speed up the authorisation process through a centralised food safety evaluation undertaken by EFSA, and would set precise deadlines at every stage of the process. It also includes an improved safety assessment to allow safe traditional food from third countries to enter the EU more easily. I am grateful for Parliament’s broad support for the improvement of the proposal to streamline the authorisation procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to nanomaterials, I underline that the Commission is considering the EP’s request for the systematic labelling of all food containing nanomaterials with a favourable disposition. However, before finalisation of the text, we need to come to an agreement on the adaptation to the new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty, especially those regarding the necessary adaptations of the definition of nanomaterials. I am confident that a balanced solution can be found so that the improved text can be finalised in a timely manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding animal cloning, I share the importance that Parliament attaches to this highly sensitive issue. As Members will recall, I am committed to producing a report considering all aspects of cloning for food production by November 2010, which will be followed by legislative proposals if appropriate. I am committed to looking at all issues, especially those relating to the health and welfare of cloned animals during their productive life and natural lifespan. The impact that any measures on cloning would have on international trade is also a key aspect which will be addressed in this report. I will view the conclusions of this report with an open mind, with a view to identifying a satisfactory and proportionate solution that can be implemented effectively. The report will act as a launching point for subsequent discussions, with the aim of reaching an outcome satisfactory to all institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Liotard, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their valuable work on this important legislative file. I look forward to hearing the views of the Members.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, as you have said, this regulation is very important, not only for consumers, but also for the food industry. It deals with novel foods and new processes for manufacturing foodstuffs.</p>
      <p sl="es">As has been said here, the most controversial issue has been that of meat originating from cloned animals and their offspring, as what generally enters the food chain is the offspring, not the cloned animal. I believe that it was a sensible move on the part of Parliament to remove the issue of meat from cloned animals from this proposal, as it is not really possible to dedicate just a few paragraphs to such a novel and new technique as the cloning of animals, even though it is normal in some countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is an amendment relating to this within which the Commission, as you have promised, is asked to present a report and a legislative proposal. We are having a bit of a debate here, including within my own group, as to whether we should ask the Commission to present a proposal banning meat from cloned animals, or simply ask the Commission to present a proposal. My opinion is that the Commission should present the proposal, and we should not tell it how to present it. The Commission should present the proposal, and then we will debate it in Parliament, say whether we like it or do not like it, and amend it. This is my position, although we are divided within my group, and tomorrow we will vote on a divided basis.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is another issue, which interests me a great deal, and which you have mentioned, which is the issue of nanomaterials. I agree that a new definition is needed, but we should not limit ourselves to definition and labelling. Any authorisation of nanomaterials must be preceded by exhaustive scientific tests, as these are new materials that are to be incorporated into food, and the question of food safety needs to be a priority. I hope and trust that this will be the case.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her efforts and also for her cooperation on many of the important issues our group had.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The main concern which the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament had still related to food derived from cloned animals. Limited research has been carried out on the effects of eating food derived from cloned animals on humans and no research has been conducted to reach the conclusion that such food is safe to eat.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Ethical concerns about the use of cloning, the lack of knowledge about the effects of eating such food products on consumers, as well as issues concerning animal welfare, lead us to the conclusion that there is no justification for the use of cloning to produce food.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report also deals with the issue of food products containing nanomaterials, as well as the issue of food produced using nanotechnology. The effects of nanomaterials on the human body are unknown. We must do our utmost to guarantee safe consumption. Therefore, we will support the development by the European Food Safety Authority of special methods for evaluating the risks involved before such food is authorised for sale. We must adopt a cautious approach to food technologies if we do not fully understand their impact on the human body and environment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also important to keep consumers informed about what they are eating; hence the reason I support the labelling requirements.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although the main objective of this regulation ought to be about making certain that the food is safe for human consumption, animal welfare is also an important concern. I am happy to support the amendments which will improve animal welfare, such as the development of alternative test methods and the exchange of data between applicants for novel foods, if this will avoid repeating the tests on animals.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Parliament’s position on these issues was very clear at first reading and the report was adopted by a large majority. Given that the Council showed itself to be extremely reluctant to reach a compromise on the issue of food derived from cloned animals, it is important that Parliament adopts a firm stance now. We represent citizens and we must not forget this fact.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and, on behalf of our shadow rapporteur, Ms Lepage, I would like to express our support for the main key points of the report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
      <p sl="de">As my colleague said, the main outstanding issue in the revision of the novel foods regulation is the question of animal cloning. While no safety concerns have been identified so far with meat produced from cloned animals, such a technology still raises serious concerns about animal welfare, the reduction of biodiversity, and ethical considerations.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is why we want to exclude meat produced from cloned animals and their offspring from the scope of this regulation, and we ask the Commission to present a legislative proposal addressing all aspects of this issue. It would be unacceptable to set up an authorisation process for the marketing of cloned animals without giving European citizens and the European Parliament the chance to have a proper debate about all the implications of this technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me also remind you that this position has already been clearly expressed by Parliament in its 2008 resolution on the cloning of animals for the food supply chain.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to nanofood, we should indeed make sure that no products containing engineered nanoparticulates are put on the market until appropriate specific risk assessment methods have been developed and approved. Guidelines in this regard should be drafted by EFSA in consultation with all stakeholders and approved by Member States and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">Most of us would also agree that the question of transparency is crucial when we address this dossier. We therefore need to guarantee public access to data on which the risk assessment for novel food is based. It is not only studies paid by public money that should be publicly accessible, but all data related to risk assessment, in conformity with the Aarhus Convention and the EU law currently applying.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is no contradiction with this principle of public access to data and protection of intellectual property rights, as long as an applicant who uses data from another applicant pays royalties. Transparency should also apply when we speak about the labelling of products from animals fed by GMOs.</p>
      <p sl="de">To conclude, I would like to stress our hope that the discussion in conciliation will lead to a clear text which guarantees both safety and transparency for our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I was first elected in 1999, one of the first debates in which I spoke concerned food safety. We Belgian Members had been elected in the midst of the food crisis there, which involved chickens, PCBs and similar issues. One of the first things the Commission proposed back then was the White Paper on Food Safety, which, I believe, proposed 83 measures to ensure food safety in the European Union. That was 11 years ago, and so many years later, we can be proud of the work accomplished. I believe that approximately 90% of that work has been implemented, and indeed one of the few outstanding issues relates to the European Commission’s announcement back then of its intention to explore how to deal with this kind of product: novel foods, that is. These are foods manufactured using new production techniques, foods that did not exist before 15 May 1997. The original Commission proposal from January 2008 had a number of objectives: ensuring food safety, protecting human health and also securing the functioning of the market for food.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As I see it, over the last three years, rapporteur Mrs Liotard has steered a splendid course and has demonstrated constructive cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs and also within Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. At first reading, she managed to obtain the support of a particularly large majority for her proposals: 658 MEPs supported her work, which is a majority of the kind seldom seen. Therefore, I think it important, Commissioner – and Council, which is unfortunately absent – to bear in mind that this House is united, and is incredibly strong. We believe that foods derived from cloned animals and their offspring should be excluded from the scope of this regulation, and we do indeed want more than just a report, Commissioner; we want the European Commission to table a legislative proposal.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants to go even further; we also want a moratorium on these foods. We want the Commission to present a legislative proposal without delay, and we are really pushing for this. I believe it is very clear, including from the words of the previous speakers, that this House is united. The – absent – Council has accepted only a very limited number of amendments from our first reading. It is clear that the Council is taking a very unyielding approach to this dossier; something that I find regrettable. Such an unyielding approach has meant that, despite the efforts of the past weeks and months and the countless informal meetings, we have not in fact progressed a single step and are now forced to go to second reading, to stay strongly united and to ensure that we do make some progress in conciliation with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, my whole group supports the rapporteur’s approach, the desire to retain as many of the first reading amendments as possible and also the whole approach to cloned animals and other elements of this proposal. I hope the Council receives this message loud and clear after the vote and that we can then establish honest, constructive dialogue. I hope the Commission does keep its promise to produce not just a report but an actual legislative proposal. I believe this is something the European public really needs and is calling for.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank my fellow Member, Mrs Liotard, for her sterling work. Personally, I am always in favour of putting consumers’ safety and right to information first, and that applies to all foods. The report that we are discussing here deals, among other things, with the issues of new food additives, enzymes, flavourings and ingredients with flavouring properties, as well as the issue of food containing nanomaterials. Can these things affect our health? If so, should they therefore be included in a regulation on medicinal products?</p>
      <p sl="da">It makes sense to have EU legislation in this area, but there are many different interests involved. Nanomaterials, cloned animals and esoteric products are already consumed to a large extent in other parts of the world. Who actually wants these new initiatives? Is it the industry that wants to sell more products? Or is it really the consumer? I do not believe it is the latter. I believe that citizens in the EU want good food in their supermarkets with a reasonable declaration of the ingredients. In my home country, I see more and more customers choosing organic goods, which signify a good standard of animal welfare and no artificial additives.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, I would like to say something about cloned animals – and my thanks to Commissioner Dalli for his comments on this subject. In Europe, we can easily feed ourselves without the need for cloned products. My own small country, with a population of 5.5 million, produces around 25 million pigs and more than 100 million chickens a year without any use of cloning.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Food products obtained by using nanotechnology must certainly be submitted to specific risk assessments before being approved, labelled and placed on the European market, as is true for food derived from cloned animals and their offspring. The precise purpose of these regulations is to safeguard food safety and human health.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I agree that the name ‘novel foods’, although uninspired, is interesting enough to make you long for every kind of beautifully coloured, juicy fruit, offering an extraordinary taste, never having been seen before. Unfortunately, however, the reality is much duller. We are justified in not wanting food products obtained by using nanotechnology to be approved until after nanospecific tests have been carried out.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Just because, in recent years, scientific discoveries are being made in this field at an ever-faster rate and their practical applications may provide real, life-saving solutions for eradicating hunger or tackling the effects of the economic crisis in the future, this does not give us the right to discard any concern for our safety and health and for those of future generations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is amazing how casually we often talk about food derived from cloned animals, as if it has been around for hundreds of years and we could not imagine our everyday lives without it. Need I remind you that the technology being used to obtain such food is still experimental in many respects.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would just like to end by asking you a question: are you willing to put this food on the table for your children to eat?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to express my thanks to Mrs Liotard. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) cannot support her on every point. We take a different view regarding additives and animals fed with feed derived from GMO plants. However, she has done an excellent job. I also want to thank our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso, for the excellent work she has done.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, as she has already mentioned, there was a controversial debate within our group on the topic of animal cloning. I am pleased to say as coordinator that the majority of the PPE Group are in favour of the ban on cloning and that we will also vote in favour tomorrow as a group, regardless of individual opinions which take a different view on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The following important reasons were put forward during the discussion in the group. Firstly, even our agricultural experts do not feel it is necessary for us to have meat from cloned animals to guarantee our food supply. We do not need it. Unfortunately, we must say on ethical grounds that, if the cloning of animals is used on a large scale, it will also become easier to clone people, which is quite clearly unethical.</p>
      <p sl="de">The population is very evidently against it, as stated by all the surveys. I am sure that we are not just talking here about a vague gut feeling. Anyone who has taken a really close look at the statement from the EFSA cannot endorse it in good conscience. It contains so many unanswered questions, justifying this sense of unease.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the crucial reason is animal protection. This is mentioned by the EFSA, EGE and many other agencies. Cloned animals suffer. Only around 10% of implanted embryos ever reach birth, and then a third of them die by the third month. They suffer an agonising death. They often need to be put to sleep because they have terrible diseases. Animal protection is not just a principle which we can apply willy-nilly. The authors of the treaties have imposed this on us. We must absolutely avoid creating laws which fail to take animal protection into consideration. It is for these reasons that we will be supporting it tomorrow too, with a large majority.</p>

    <intervention id="2-556" speaker_id="4262" name="Jo Leinen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a similar picture seems to be emerging from within all the groups. We had an interesting debate too on this regulation, which was also filled with controversy. However, the large majority of us feel that we will vote tomorrow with the rapporteur and give a clear signal to the Commission and Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I believe that you said that we have a consensus. With novel foods, we need prior authorisation before they enter the market. I also explicitly agree that we need a central authorisation procedure and not different authorisation procedures in 27 Member States. This would not conform to the concept of the internal market and the uniformity of health and living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have new technologies entering the food market – as has already been mentioned in this Chamber – such as nanotechnology and GMOs. We are adopting a cautious approach in this House until we know all the facts and can be sure that our citizens can buy food which is totally safe in our supermarkets and then eat it afterwards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are not calling for a ban on GMOs and nanomaterials. We want consumers to be given the freedom of choice or, in other words, a label indicating if these materials are contained in the food. I hope that during its cross-section debate on nanomaterials next week, the Commission will also reach a definition and perhaps a regulation so that we can have more material available about how we should handle nanomaterials.</p>
      <p sl="de">A great deal has already been said about meat from cloned animals. I would like you, Commissioner, to remove this section from the novel foods regulation. This would pave the way for a regulation on all the other topics which are not controversial. However, I would still call for a decision to be made about a separate regulation for meat from cloned animals before the conciliation procedure has ended, and to remove this from the novel foods regulation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the novel foods regulation includes a list of traditional foods from third countries to be admitted onto the European market.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Committee on the Environment has approved the amendment proposed by my Group, according to which these foods shall have to conform to the safety requirements in force in the European Union. Furthermore, we enthusiastically welcomed the proposal to subject these foodstuffs to an advance ethical opinion, to avoid the circulation on our market of foods deriving from endangered species, or the consumption of foods which would be reproachable for us Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main point of difference relates to the inclusion on the list of cloned meat for food, which we do not want. An agreement was not reached between the parties during the trialogue. Despite this, the wait cannot continue any longer, but the Commission ought to submit some proposals on the labelling and traceability of meat from cloned animals as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Unfortunately, the most crucial breakthrough for farmers is not included in the report on food products arriving in the EU from third countries. Such a breakthrough, fair competition and fair trade would have required that only food produced by manufacturers complying with strict standards similar to those met by European farmers – such as Hungarian farmers, for instance – are allowed into the European Union. We all know about the extremely rigorous cross-compliance rules. We should specify it as a requirement that food from third countries can only be imported into the EU if identical animal welfare, food safety, environmental protection, social and other criteria are met. However, there is a positive breakthrough, namely, that according to one of the proposed amendments, the labelling of products derived from foraging animals which are fed genetically modified organisms should mention this fact. We welcome this. We also support the fact that the report gives priority to food and consumer safety as a fundamental principle instead of the unconditional enforcement of free trade that previously seemed to be above almost all other considerations. Please take into account the rather difficult situation currently facing farmers and ensure fair competition for European farmers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating a regulation which is particularly important because it deals with novel foods, because technological innovation plays a crucial role in the food processing industry and because it must always serve the interests of the consumer. This is how we can recognise the benefits of certain healthier novel foods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, on the sensitive issue of the placing on the EU market of food derived from cloned animals, and particularly their offspring, I cannot go along with those who, straight away, wish to take advantage of this regulation to talk about a systematic ban. I find it regrettable to have only one ideological opinion on the issue of cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission has pledged to put a proposal to us. Without anticipating whether or not there will be a ban, let us be careful not to indulge in any scientific populism on such sensitive issues, which require a very rational approach. Let us not systematically adopt a defensive position or, worse still, an entrenched position on a complex matter which deserves to be studied in depth. The precautionary principle must be observed, but it must be founded on scientific and not ideological opinions, and on a risk assessment. Had the precautionary principle existed a few decades ago, the first heart transplants would never have taken place and hundreds of sick people would not have been cured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is no doubt that prudence requires us to respond to questions about nanomaterials, about the semen of cloned bulls, already imported by many European breeders. What consequences will this have for transatlantic trade when, in practice, foods derived from the offspring of these cloned cattle are already on the European markets?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us therefore withdraw foods derived from cloned animals from this regulation and allow the European Commission to work at its own pace to guarantee greater food security for consumers. Our Parliament will then be entirely free to debate, amend and finally voice its opinion on this fundamental issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I asked myself the following question at the start of the discussions: Do we need a regulation on novel foods? Do we not already have enough rules governing food? We certainly do need it. However, I have certain criticisms regarding this document at second reading, especially in the light of our efforts to cut red tape. If there is going to be a novel foods regulation, it should really only apply to novel foods. If the rapporteur now, before the second reading, brings back all the amendments rejected from the first reading with regard to genetically modified products, for instance, where there is already very comprehensive legislation, this should be flatly rejected.</p>
      <p sl="de">Constantly rehashing ideological concepts which have already been dealt with and rejected umpteen times does not convey a clear legislative process, but mainly serves just to confuse the general public.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation is different with regard to nanotechnology, which is a new procedure. However, we should avoid demonising this new technology, as has often happened in the past. We must not stand in the way of progress. Just a few weeks ago, I attended a talk on nanotechnology given by a representative of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany. I am astounded at the information that is already available and at the research that has been carried out. We should invite this representative to appear in committee, which would put a stop to speeches about how we still need to do a great deal of research. We certainly still need to do this with nanotechnology, but the opportunities which it opens up are huge. We should continue to utilise and promote them.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards animal cloning, I would like to remind you that we made an explicit undertaking with the Treaty of Lisbon to protect animal welfare and to take animal protection fully into account in all legislative procedures. This is why I am pleased that the Commissioner has already agreed to table a new document on this issue. I look forward to finding out what will be put before us. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The purpose of this regulation is to provide a higher level of food safety and protection for consumers, the environment and animal welfare, based on the precautionary principle.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There are major doubts at the moment surrounding the safety of meat derived from cloned animals. These animals have suffered premature ageing or other diseases. Scientists do not understand very clearly either what the reasons are for the differences between the breeds of animals produced using traditional techniques and those reproduced using cloning.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Cloned animals suffer. Most cloned organisms have not survived or have died prematurely. The success rate is one viable organism in 75 cloning attempts. Last but not least, cloning also raises issues about the safety of using these techniques. This technique is still too dangerous to be used for the direct benefit of mankind. It is a serious ethical issue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given the serious health risks involved and the moral consequences of using these techniques, I believe that we must not beat about the bush on this matter.

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the food I put on my dinner table is not the same as the food my parents ate when they were young. The food my parents put on their dinner table is not the same as the food my grandparents ate when they were young. That is something that we should, in fact, be pleased about, partly because the variety of food has increased, but mainly because it is a prerequisite for us to be able to feed the whole planet.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What we will be voting on here tomorrow is something as strange as what my children and my grandchildren will be putting on their dinner table. It is important to remember here that we must not simply prohibit or put obstacles in the way of something that is new. We must guarantee that it is safe. In this regard, I would like to remind you of three basic principles that have guided me, and that I hope will guide my fellow Members.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Firstly, the legislation must have a scientific basis. Our decisions must be based on relevant research, and on objective and well-conducted science. It must not be a question of personal taste, religious conviction or particular interests. In order to meet future challenges, we need to welcome innovation and science, not prevent or obstruct it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, it is important to use a scientific basis to take note of and safeguard the safety of novel foods. Consumers will reject novel foods if they cannot be certain that what we are offering is indeed safe. The citizens of Europe have a right to demand that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly and lastly, food safety must never be used as a pretext for protectionism and new barriers to trade. This is at complete odds with innovation and development.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thus, I would like to see innovation and the development of novel but, above all, safe products. We must not impede or prevent new things, but we must guarantee that they are safe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, novel foods mean that we also need new regulations. Apart from the issue of consumer protection, there are relevant ethical questions as well that are raised by the production of novel foods.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main concern here, as also highlighted by the debate in the Chamber this evening, is the issue of meat from cloned animals. The situation in the European Union regarding our meat supply is adequate. There is no reason, therefore, to have to fall back on meat from cloned animals.</p>
      <p sl="de">Meat from cloned animals is definitely not a priori harmful. However, risks cannot always be excluded either. There is no reliable evidence available to show what kind of suffering such animals endure. What is known for definite at the moment – and this is borne out by the statistics – is that cloned animals become ill more often.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cloning is a clear encroachment on nature and we require a clear political decision on this. Not everything that can be made is also for mankind’s benefit. There must be no cloned animals in the food chain. We must send out a consistent, clear political message to the Commission and our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important topic in this regulation is the rules on nanotechnology. In order to guarantee a high level of consumer protection and legal certainty for producers, we urgently need a definition with a horizontal scope, which not only applies to novel foods, but also to the food contact materials and cosmetics directives, as well as the biocide authorisation regulation, which we are currently consulting on at first reading.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight out of ten European citizens consider the cloning of animals for food to be unjustifiable and six out of ten say they would never consume products derived from cloned animals. This data confirms once again that there is not one valid reason to allow the cloning of animals for food.</p>
      <p sl="it">Authorising the trade in food and products derived from cloned animals must make us all reflect carefully on the consequences of such a choice. To allow today the consumption of meat, milk and cheese from cloned animals could, in the future, mean allowing trade in products which are not healthy and not natural but artificially created in a laboratory. Further, as Mrs Antonescu said a short time ago, we still do not know today if cloning for food purposes really is safe and does not pose risks to human health. We only know that this technique causes suffering, hurt and pain to animals, which is often avoidable.</p>
      <p sl="it">Traditional production methods and the work of millions of farms which, through hard work and sacrifice, guarantee excellent products every day, are also put at risk by cloned food. So finally, I say ‘no’ to cloned food on our tables but ‘yes’ to a healthy, balanced and – why not, if I may say so – Mediterranean diet.</p>

The agricultural sector in Europe produces food of the highest standard, whether based on conventional or organic agricultural production. Stringent regulations and quality standards are constantly being imposed on and implemented by the agricultural sector in Europe. The precautionary principle must apply in particular in the food sector. We do not need meat from cloned animals for the sake of food supply security. As the European Parliament we should, during the forthcoming second reading, …</p>

There are a whole range of reasons why we do not need this meat from cloned animals. Our European citizens, who are our consumers, reject this product.

The same applies to nanotechnologies and one very important issue that we need to address in this directive is the labelling of modified products.

The contentious issue now is products from cloned animals, which I do not support personally, and the labelling of products from animals fed on genetically-modified foodstuffs. However, this regulation did not originally apply to genetically modified foodstuffs, which are handled by another directive, and we should ask the Commission to revise it. Before that, however, this House should state that meat from cloned animals does not belong among the objectives of our agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to extend my warmest thanks to all those who have participated in this debate. I think it a great shame that the Council is not present, as I believe that this House has again taken a very clear position on cloning, and indeed considers that this has no place in the present regulation and should, at all events, be the subject of open and public debate. I myself would not want meat from cloned animals on my plate, but I can imagine others saying we want separate legislation. In any case, it is very clear that we want to see separate legislation on this and that it should not be dealt with as part of the novel foods regulation. I hope that this message comes across very clearly, as today we have been talking about nanotechnology and cloning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Indeed, much has been said about this, but the novel foods regulation is about very much more. It is about all the new technologies that are on the verge of discovery or that scientists are working on at the moment. We do not want to stand in the way of innovation, but we do want consumers and producers to know where they stand, and we want to know for certain that the food on our plates is safe. Therefore, I hope that this discussion on cloning will no longer stand in the way of the novel foods legislation, and also that developing countries wanting to place natural, traditional foods on the European market are not now deterred by this kind of bickering from trading with the European Union in simple, natural products. I hope that Parliament will repeat the signal it has given in today’s debate with equal clarity in tomorrow’s vote, and then, I believe, things should turn out fine.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report adopted today on the placing on the market of novel foods is further confirmation of our Parliament’s responsiveness to the information and food safety demands made by Europeans, rather than to those made by animal testing and food lobbies, which are often motivated by economic concerns. We reject in principle the genetic modification of humans, animals or plants until it is demonstrated at every level that it has absolutely no repercussions for citizens’ health. Animals, moreover, should not suffer for human health. I wonder what possible advantage there can be in consumers having access to meat that comes from an animal that has been battered prior to slaughter, and ‘reconstituted’ into a succulent steak through an injection of engineered nanomaterials or proteins. Only a few months ago, when voting on thrombin, also known as ‘meat glue’, I voiced my concerns about initiatives that have a clear industrial benefit without, at the same time, guaranteeing complete protection of consumers. I therefore voted in favour of Amendment 14, in which it is argued that the European Commission must undertake to present a specific legislative proposal on the placing on the market of novel foods derived from cloning processes. As a good Italian and Emilia-Romagnan, the only ‘pies’ that I enjoy are those of the ‘alla bolognese ’ kind, since I can be sure that the age-old recipe is authentic. I reject, on the other hand, those genetically modified ones that are served up to consumers without any detailed information to make them fully aware of the true nature of the food on their plate.

      <p sl="pl">Today’s debate on novel foods is very important from the point of view of protecting the health and life of consumers throughout the European Union. For it is extremely important that both Parliament and the Commission create mechanisms whose fundamental purpose will be to prevent the adverse effects which might be caused by putting new products on the market about which we still do not have, today, full knowledge as to what effect their consumption may have on the body. All citizens of the Union are entitled to the necessary protection and security in this area. They must have complete confidence that food available on the market does not contain ingredients which are new, unidentified and perhaps harmful to health. Therefore, we cannot allow the sale of food products made using technologies which have not been used or tested before. I am certain that on the matter of introducing new food to the market, strict precedence must be given, above all else, to protecting the health and life of consumers. Only if this is guaranteed can new products be authorised for sale in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this debate was timed badly. I would like to have seen the Dutch team win, even if for the last time in this World Cup. This is perhaps a bad omen, because we are no longer allowed to watch, so they will probably not win after all.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, today – or more precisely tomorrow – we are completing a legislative package that we have been discussing for more than two years. It is not just controversy that is responsible for this, but also the European elections that have taken place in the meantime, and also the entry into force of a new EU Treaty which has meant that we have had to adjust a few things.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I think that, if we can draw a conclusion from today’s debate, it is that we are voting on a compromise which completely deserves to be approved, even if, in some areas, we might do so with gritted teeth.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to emphasise two aspects. The first is the environmental requirements in industrial plants. What we are talking about here is the better implementation of best available techniques in Europe. I think that we have found a paragraph of exceptions in the compromise which is currently before us which gives the European Commission – Mr Potočnik, here I am addressing you directly – the tools to ensure over the next few years, better and more firmly than has been the case up to now, that the approximately 52 000 industrial plants in Europe which are affected by this finally make better use of best available techniques than they currently do.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have heard many arguments in this debate. I would like to take up one of these and deflect it, because I cannot comprehend it at all. It has often been said to me that the use of best available techniques is too expensive and that we will thereby endanger the competitiveness of European industry, and even more so in the crisis. I do not like to remember my past, but I come from the former GDR, East Germany. The economic and ecological collapse of the GDR was attributable to the fact that for decades, we neglected to invest in up-to-date technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that every industry and every industrial enterprise, for its existence, needs to invest in up-to-date technology, because otherwise it will become less competitive, and this naturally means also reducing emissions of pollutants. Today, we have the opportunity to bring in a law which will improve this situation from which we are starting.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second part of the directive – and here we have some of the gritted teeth that I mentioned – deals with large combustion plants. We are talking once more – as we did before with the last directive – about renewing exceptions up to 2020, and in some cases 2023, for large combustion plants which do not have to achieve the environmental obligations and, in particular, the limits on air pollutants.</p>
      <p sl="de">Here I call on the Council, but also perhaps all of us here, to consider very carefully how sensible it really is that we regularly bring in ambitious environmental targets, and we discuss them and welcome them here, but always, whenever it comes to implementing them and transforming them into concrete legislation, then a tragedy begins in Europe. Then it suddenly becomes clear to the Member States how much it costs, which bills we have to pay, and then, as a rule, the ones who have done this in advance are punished.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are a number of Member States which now already meet the obligations, and which will, in the end, be left out in the cold. I will say it here once again: whether we are talking about industrial plants or large combustion plants – which essentially means coal power stations – we are not dealing with science fiction. We are not talking about things which are not available; on the contrary, this is up-to-date technology. Best available techniques – what is available on the market given competitive and cost factors – can be incorporated into these plants, and today, against this background, we are completing a legislative package which I think is better than what is currently in force, and therefore I would encourage us all to approve it. I would also like to thank my fellow Members, who, while sometimes pulling no punches, have worked with me on this for the last two years, for their support, their legwork and, above all, for the fact that almost all of the main groups have subscribed to this compromise.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, since I am also a sports fan I share your views, but there is a comfortable 3-1 lead for the Netherlands, and I think the proposal we are discussing today is worth being here for.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are at the threshold of an agreement on industrial emissions that will bring European Union action to reduce pollution from the largest industrial sources into line with ambitious environmental objectives. At the same time, it will provide opportunities for eco-innovation and strengthen sustainable production methods in important sectors of our economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would not have reached this point if it were not for the hard work of the European Parliament on this important dossier. I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Holger Krahmer, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, for the excellent work carried out on the proposal for a directive on industrial emissions.</p>
      <p sl="en">This directive represents a significant step forward in the control of industrial pollution in the European Union. We presently find ourselves in a situation where industrial pollution accounts for over 80% of emissions of sulphur dioxide, over 40% of dust and over 30% of nitrogen oxides. We find ourselves also in a situation where implementation at local level, with differing applications of best available techniques, is diverse.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore very clear that the status quo is insufficient, not only in terms of protection of the environment, but also in terms of distortion of competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strengthening of two of the core elements of the legislation – the application of the best available techniques as a rule, and revised emission limit values for major sectors – is absolutely necessary, and I am happy to see that Parliament shares this point of view.</p>
      <p sl="en">Action here will ensure that industrial installations throughout the European Union achieve high environmental standards and protect the health and well-being of our citizens. It also provides us with the opportunity to stimulate eco-innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The work of the European Parliament, as I already mentioned, has been key in reaching an agreement that maintains the environmental integrity of the Commission’s proposal and that, on a number of occasions in the institutional process, seemed unachievable. By voting now to agree on this directive, Parliament can demonstrate its true commitment to reducing pollution from industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission can accept the compromise package – and it is a compromise – in order to reach an agreement on this directive at second reading, and I would encourage Parliament adopt the same position.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should particularly like to compliment our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, since we all know that we have truly achieved a result which at times seemed hopeless. I would like to point out that this directive, this dossier, was thought to be at serious risk of going to conciliation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, as we have also heard from the Commissioner, it is obvious to all that we are dealing with a piece of work which has been complex and which has required a great deal of time. One need only reflect that this is a directive from 1996 and that the work done brings us to the fifth and most important amendment of the directive on industrial emissions.</p>
      <p sl="it">These few bits of information alone tell us, I believe, about all the shortcomings and defects of this legislation. The directive has proved difficult to implement – I would note that infraction procedures have been opened against nine Member States – and has a sphere of application so wide that at times it is actually inappropriate. So, all of this – we must not hide from it – has led to great efforts, has required sacrifices from all institutions involved, all political groups and all national delegations, and it has frequently put us face-to-face with truly difficult choices.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, this evening, I am here to say with conviction that, in my opinion, we have achieved the best possible result to protect competition, the environment, and European industrial and employment policy. We truly have, on the one hand, a directive which imposes common obligations on all Member States and, on the other, a directive which also allows the necessary flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="it">So, I truly hope that the results of this recasting have an immediate effect on reducing administrative burdens and, in the medium term, improve environmental performance and strengthen European industry.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Krahmer for having pushed for ambitious legislation. I would also like to thank everyone who has given their support and come up with proposals, because the work that has been done on this directive is important. The directive covers more than 50 000 industrial plants, in other words, plants that employ a lot of people while, at the same time, being the cause of a large proportion of the air pollution and which therefore have an impact on the environment and people’s health. The proposal that we will be voting on tomorrow is far from perfect, but nevertheless represents a definite step in the right direction compared with current legislation. It is therefore worth voting for.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The main problem is that we are extending the time limit for exemptions for large combustion plants, despite the fact that they are responsible for 90% of the industrial emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. On this issue, we were quite simply not able to get the better of the Conservative parties in the Council and the European Parliament, which I feel is unfortunate. Nevertheless, the positive aspect of the proposal that we are to vote on tomorrow is the fact that, in future, there will be stricter and clearer conditions for when exemptions can be granted. The main priority of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament was precisely this, namely to create order and a stronger wording that would mean that there can de facto be fewer exemptions than there are today. I am pleased that we succeeded in achieving this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, the best available technique and reference documents will play more of a key role, and the industry will have a great deal of flexibility to make the necessary investments. Overall, this may mean that we create the conditions for taking a step towards a reduction in industrial emissions and all of the positive consequences that that will entail for health and the environment. At the same time, we will also be taking steps towards fairer competition, as the amendments will provide the impetus for better implementation with regard to emission limits. Last but not least, additional and safer jobs will be created when our part of the world has to face up to competition from countries where large investments are currently being made in precisely this type of transition. Mr Krahmer, we must not end up in a situation like that of East Germany where we are lagging behind.</p>

      <p sl="de">He has been able to argue that, with regard to this legislation, Germany has applied it effectively, or more effectively than any other Member State, including my own. This places Germany at a competitive disadvantage compared to others. This is an argument that can apply to many aspects of environmental legislation. There has to be a level playing field. The legislation that we put in force has to be applied equally and effectively across the European Union if we are to protect the environment, and if we are to ensure that certain countries do not gain a competitive advantage by not investing in the improvements that are necessary to make that possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The question is that we have now recast this legislation. We have not perhaps relaxed it, but we have addressed the fact that the first measure failed to be applied by Member States. Member States have got off the hook. My Member State, the United Kingdom, has got off the hook. It has not done what Germany did.</p>

This has meant that, for example, the Netherlands currently suffers more air pollution from three filthy coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom than from the 11 Dutch power stations. This indicates very clearly how uneven the playing field is in terms of air quality and of our approach to industry. The Netherlands, and also Germany, the home country of my colleague Mr Krahmer, has implemented this very well and very strictly, whilst other countries, such as Italy and the United Kingdom, have been failing to do so for years. It is crystal clear that this legislation needs to be tightened up, and so it pains me to see Italy and the United Kingdom, in particular, blocking improvements time and again in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, when all is said and done, I am a definite supporter of this tightening up. After all, although they have another 12 years, afterwards even the power stations in the United Kingdom and Italy, and also elsewhere in Europe, will have to comply with the high standards, thus guaranteeing the health of our citizens in all the EU Member States. At the end of the day, that is what this is all about.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will ultimately be voting in favour of this legislation, but with a heavy heart, as it has been such heavy going. So often, we hear all MEPs speak of the need for a level playing field, but when it comes to implementing this for the sake of clean air, many Member States back out and lag behind. This shortcoming remains but, at the end of the day, it will not be long before all Member States have to comply. We are to be given a level playing field and we are to have clean air. That is something worth voting in favour of, although the process has been disappointing, with a number of Member States letting us down. At the end of the day, however, we are making progress. I believe that the match is now over, and that the Netherlands has reached the final.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I hope that Mr Eickhout’s disappointment at the legislation we are discussing this evening is mitigated by a famous victory for the Netherlands, using perhaps the best available football techniques in their game this evening. Sadly, England could not be there, but never mind; we cannot have everything.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moving to the subject of the debate, I would first of all like to pay tribute to the work that Holger Krahmer did. It was a very long, complicated piece of legislation and he genuinely worked to involve all of the political groups and all of the different shades of opinion in this debate. We have reached, in the end, what is an acceptable compromise. Nobody got what they wanted – perhaps that is the mark of good European legislation but it is a bit of a messy fudge – and nobody is happy. Member States are not particularly happy. Certainly some Members of this House are very unhappy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope Mr Eickhout’s unhappiness is mitigated later but, nevertheless, it is a good overall result. The compromises reached are, in my view, a good balance between, on the one hand, protecting the environment but, on the other, taking into account some of the quite legitimate concerns held by some Member States that forcing a lot of coal plants to close early would actually be a bad thing for the environment – what would the power be replaced by? We have our long-term emissions legislation and directives to meet, which would be compromised by forcing too many plants to close early, and, at the end of the day, all the improvements we want to see have to be paid for by somebody. At the end of the day, that is always the consumer. We have a recession across Europe and we must be careful to get the balance right between environmental protection and costly improvements.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Krahmer, ladies and gentlemen, the new directive will create a new, more demanding and up-to-date legislative framework for industrial emissions, which we consider to be an important step forward for better defence of the environment and of public health, particularly of those living and working near industrial complexes or in areas affected by them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By setting limits to emissions of an expanded series of pollutants and establishing the need to adapt high-emissions industries to these limits using the improved technologies that are available, an important principle is established: that in order to protect the environment and public health, we must implement in productive processes the best technology that scientific and technological development made available to us, particularly in those with the greatest environmental impact.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is also the approach we support for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. As an alternative to the use of market instruments such as carbon trading, which the European Union has been supporting, we propose a legislative approach that is environmentally efficient and socially just, in contrast to what happens with the commercial approach.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For this reason, we welcome the rejection at this second reading of the application of emissions trading to nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide as some have suggested, and we have noted the amendment that clarifies the possibility of also setting limits, and hence an approach by legislation and not by the market, for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases subject to the European trading system for emission licenses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nevertheless, while continuing this overall effort to reduce emissions, we must not forget the differences that exist between Member States and the specificities of each, such as the respective productive systems and conditions of production, as well as the ability to implement the necessary adaptations in technology and productive processes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This commitment ensures that this varied reality will be observed. The appropriate and justified amendments that are envisaged, alongside the national transition plans, ensure the flexibility needed for the implementation of the improved technologies that are available, without compromising the original goals of protecting the environment and public health.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We also appreciate the possibility expressed for Member States to maintain or adopt stricter protection measures than those set in the present directive, namely regarding the aforementioned greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order to safeguard sustainable production in the various Member States and regions, this new legislative framework must be complemented with EU measures supporting the modernisation of productive systems, especially in the more vulnerable economies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, it is also essential to support investment in public research and development to ensure that the best technologies available are developed and continuously improved.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the measure being examined today is one of the most important in the entire legislature and shall indeed have significant economic ramifications.</p>
      <p sl="it">We began with a text approved in committee with the Lega Nord delegation voting against it since, as it was initially proposed, it would have brought the closure of many industrial plants and the restructuring of others. Following the Council’s block and a series of trialogues held between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the Council and the Commission, it was revised and amended with, in our view, an overall improvement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, we shall vote on a text which increases attention towards the environment by industries but which, at the same time, does not have an excessive impact on the European industrial economy, particularly in the time of crisis which we are currently going through. Respect for the environment does not mean closing European industrial plants, because these facilities would simply move to third countries or emerging markets where environmental controls are non-existent.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, China recently declared that it has no intention of reducing its ratio of energy source usage – 80% coal to 20% oil – and, in fact, has declared that it wants to double its energy needs by 2020. Closing or moving businesses from Europe to other countries brings no advantage to the global environment, only lost jobs and aggravation of the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the compromise achieved with the Council, which we shall be called on to vote for tomorrow, finalises the framework for industrial emissions in Europe over coming decades. It is a legislative success because, at a time of serious economic difficulty and important environmental challenges, a logical, realistic and balanced solution is being promoted.</p>
      <p sl="el">This applies in particular to the transitional national plans which will apply to large power plants. In my country, in Greece, the initial provisions required immediate adjustment, which put thousands of jobs and the country’s energy security in danger or, alternatively, would have required new filters worth hundreds of millions of euro to be fitted to old plants due for closure in three to four years. In other words, either we would have wasted a massive amount of money or we would have had to pay a huge economic and social cost.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, the electricity market is not yet a single market. It will take time to achieve that objective. If, therefore, we seek draconian measures for just one aspect of the market, then that will generate serious costs to states on the rim of the Union which, as yet, have no interconnections or contact with the rest of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="el">With the compromise, on the other hand, between national plans, we have achieved – albeit belatedly – huge environmental benefits which will accrue at different times, depending on the real conditions and situation in each Member State, at no huge social cost. It is a judicious arrangement with which those of us who warmly supported it have every reason to be satisfied.</p>

The thanks for this must, of course, go to our rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, for his excellent work, but also to all the shadow rapporteurs and the others who stayed with us on this objective to make Europe’s air cleaner.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Environment Agency has given us a report which shows that in some areas, we still have a bad situation as regards air pollution, nitrogen oxides and dust. Commissioner, you said it yourself. Now we hope that, with this new amendment, you will also have a tool for carrying out controls. We hope that you will also really implement this in a hard-headed manner and not accept any major exemptions or time wasting. After all, the previous directive dates from 1996 – that is, 14 years ago!</p>
      <p sl="de">I can understand the new Member States such as Poland and others, but I cannot understand the old Member States at all – the fact that in all these years, so little has been done, and the arguments that we hear again in this instance too, with regard to jobs and costs. Well, of course, these things always turn out badly; if we wait too long, then everything comes at once. If we do our work on time, then we can also carry out innovations and still protect jobs.</p>

Companies might close and the costs for solving the resulting problems will be much higher than if we really tried to find the best solution.</p>

This is the least we must do for the sake of human health and the environment. Even after this directive, the situation will not really be good anywhere in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am especially sorry that both the number and size of the exemptions were so great under this compromise. It is quite pointless to imagine that by doing this we are doing a service to our industry or our levels of competitiveness: on the contrary, in order to implement the EU 2020 strategy, for example, we should be investing in green growth, resource efficiency and clean competitiveness. Something else that grieves me about this proposal is that no progress is being made in the areas of emissions into the soil and competency. I do hope, given how difficult the situation is of course, that the Commission will be able to implement prompt and effective measures under the Soil Directive.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of course, it is a good compromise. I am especially pleased about the inclusion of the best available techniques principle, although the European safety networks, the minimum requirements, are only at the needs assessment stage, particularly with respect to exemptions. I think that it is especially important that there has been mention of the fact that this directive will naturally not prevent Member States from applying more stringent and better legislation, and this applies to greenhouse gases too. I hope that, when the directive comes to be amended and brought up to date in the future, the Commission also makes carbon dioxide emissions part of an integrated environmental monitoring system, because this is the right and effective way to go about things.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would first like to express my genuine admiration for the rapporteur, Mr Krahmer, and for an incredible piece of work, not only from a professional, but also from a negotiating standpoint, because to achieve a compromise and such a balanced result in the case of complex and sensitive legislation of this type is an almost superhuman performance. The new directive finally unifies the procedures applied in the European Union, and contributes towards reducing the administrative burden, ending disunity in the implementation and enforcement of the regulations in the Member States. I notice, of course, a certain dissatisfaction with the result of the trialogue negotiations in my country among civic groups and the regions, but I am, at the same time, aware that although the European Parliament did not manage to carry through all of its requirements and comments, a strong compromise was achieved, which will bring a real reduction in emissions and improvements to the environment, and not only in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The transitional national plans, together with the possibility of exemptions for large combustion plants, will slow down the modernisation process to some extent, but will, at the same time, provide national economies that depend on coal for power with an opportunity to innovate, and to do so within realistic time periods. The requirement to create a European rescue network was watered down but, of course, the European Commission must reconsider the minimum emission levels at regular intervals, thereby creating a definite basis for a European emissions standard. Strict rules have been pushed through for granting postponements over the introduction of the best available techniques, with a considerable level of flexibility provided to the relevant bodies. After tomorrow’s vote, therefore, it will be time for them to take responsibility, and especially for the Commission to take responsibility and deal with the pressure, since the compromise version of the directive is a foundation, and genuine success will depend on the implementation process in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, stricter principles on industrial gas emissions and fulfilling obligations concerning environmental protection are the main objectives of changes to legislation for industrial facilities in the European Union. The draft directive on industrial emissions, which combines and amends eight existing directives, is crucial from the point of view of improving the condition of the environment and air quality in the European Union. It introduces a tightening of standards for emissions from large combustion sources, and its regulations cover a significantly higher number of combustion plants.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The energy sector of each country has its own specific character and energy security policy, at least until we adopt a common, uniform energy policy. Around 95% of the Polish energy sector is based on coal. Adoption of the new directive’s initial requirements would result in a serious threat to Poland’s energy security as well as to that of other countries in our part of Europe which are in a similar situation because their energy sector has similar characteristics.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of this, it is a good solution to make it possible for Member States to achieve environmental objectives by establishing transitional national plans, enabling the temporary application of higher emission limits. Another key factor will be the possibility of granting permits with derogations, whereby it will be possible for consent for emissions to take account of the local situation and specific geographical and economic conditions. However, changes to environmental legislation should always move in the direction of setting objectives which can be achieved by all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The compromise text restores many of the Council’s original plans, which took account of the fact that many Member States, because of their dependence on coal or geographical conditions, are unable to comply with very high environmental standards. This approach to reducing emissions and bringing in high standards is one which I think is proper, because it is both rational and workable in practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">First, a degree of flexibility is maintained for businesses and for the authorities responsible for granting exemptions. Next, I must applaud the new version of the ESN, which caused so much controversy and which seems much more achievable now that it has been restricted to certain sectors. It is also important to point out that, thanks to the agreement reached, there is a stronger link with the Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive, and the somewhat irrelevant notion of creating an SO2 and NOx quotas market has been removed once and for all from the text of the new directive. A few reservations should, nevertheless, be borne in mind, and they relate more specifically to the provisions on soils. The Soil Directive is still pending, and unfortunately, this major issue will be addressed only by those Member States which have their own legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tomorrow, Parliament has a duty to adopt the points of the agreement reached at the end of the trialogues.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to comment on two matters. The first is a quick answer – the match has ended and the score was 3:2 to the Dutch.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second matter concerns Member States with a coal-based industry and the draft directive. Poland is participating, and is going to participate, in the realisation of European energy strategy, so we welcomed the compromise reached in the trialogue on the draft directive on industrial emissions. Poland has a fuel structure which is unique at world level – over 90% of its electricity and heat are generated using local coal, which gives our country security and a high degree of energy independence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The transitional periods for large combustion plants concerning SO2 and NOx emissions are particularly important to us. Without the derogations, it would be necessary to carry out, in a technically and economically unjustified way, the premature and sudden shutdown by the end of 2015 of over 30 functioning power plants and over half of the thermal power plants and district heating plants which supply the population and industry. The transitional periods allow the process of shutting down generating facilities to be spread gradually over the years 2016-2023 and the facilities to be replaced with modern power units of the highest potential generating efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The investment process which has begun in our country is also directed towards fuel diversification in accordance with current energy policy up to 2030. This will allow a reduction in the share of solid fuels in the production of electrical energy to below 60%. It should also be said that Poland, when implementing the requirements of the climate and energy package, is going to have to make an enormous effort to achieve, in 2020, a 20% share of renewable energy, an improvement in energy efficiency and technological redevelopment of energy generation for low levels of CO2 emission.</p>

As a doctor, I would, of course, welcome a more dramatic reduction in emission ceilings, but this is not realistic in practice. I am pleased that an agreement has already been reached with industry in the Czech Republic and that there is a national plan for the gradual reduction of emission ceilings, so that the new limits should be achieved within 10 years.

It is a pity, because it is a hugely important directive for both air quality and EU industry. At the time, I did all I could to ensure that its importance would not have any negative associations, in that it was expensive without having any of the environmental benefits mentioned. It is a shame that no one asked the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for its views, even though the directive is obviously also its province.</p>

Plants will have to be closed prematurely and the costs to the consumer will be considerable. Nevertheless, it is good that the compromise takes into consideration the need for flexibility in respect of old plants that are hardly used. The premature closure of plants would represent a cost that the resultant environmental benefit would not cover. It is also good that the emission limits for carbon dioxide, as promoted by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, did not get through, because there is already too much control that overlaps with emissions trading.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a key point that allows us to address problems of environmental protection and distortion of competition is, firstly, requiring BAT conclusions to be used in setting permit conditions and, importantly, emission limit values. Flexibility is still possible but must now be clearly justified. The Commission can collect information on the use of this flexibility. The largest sources of pollution – large combustion plants – will have to apply best available techniques by mid-2020 or shut down by 2023. You are probably aware that our proposal was for a shorter time.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these measures, as well as provisions on monitoring inspections and public transparency, mean that this package should be agreed to allow us to move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is certainly ready to help in this implementation process but I have stated many times that I will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings if necessary. I hope that I have already proved that in the first half of my mandate. I believe that a level playing field is an important argument that we have to follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning competition, of course we should take care of competitiveness and competition in Europe and of course we want to compete with China – but not with their air quality standards. Even today, we can see that in Europe, there are many premature deaths which prove to have been caused by poor quality air conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is fair to say that we give industry time to build changes into normal investment plans. We should also look to a positive side of the agenda: that we also gain a technological advantage. It is important also to recognise that the Commission’s IPPC recast proposal does not fundamentally change the existing 1996 IPPC regime. The original proposal was based on a thorough impact assessment that took place over two years in Members States’ industry and non-governmental organisations. It is also crucial to remember that the concept of best available techniques takes into account the costs of applying these techniques.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to know that we have a lot of complementary policies to support industry: the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, the Environmental Technologies Action Plan, the Seventh Framework Programme, the Competition and Innovation Programme, structural funding and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">To summarise what I have heard today: better environment, stay competitive, European jobs, sustainability, cutting costs, too many exemptions, stricter rules, more flexibility needed, interests, balanced rights. That is what the compromise is bringing. The fact is that we are moving. The fact is that we are moving in the right direction, in the direction of a better quality of life, a more healthy environment, a more level playing field for industry, with stimulus for new innovation. I think that the proposal which is on the table and which was excellently handled by the rapporteur deserves your support. It certainly has the support of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, three relevant things have happened while we have been debating: first, it is clear that Europe will be the football world champions. A good omen, I think. Who exactly it will be, we will see. I do not want to express any preference now. The second is that Germany is receiving compliments from the United Kingdom. Chris Davies, many thanks! That also does not happen every day. It is certainly worth noting. Thirdly, all is still well with the world; even the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance finds football more important than environmental protection. Regrettably, our fellow Member, Mr Eickhout, has left us again. However, congratulations to our Dutch friends, of course.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wanted to talk about two aspects of the debate to which I have just been able to listen. The first is that I understand all the worries and woes of my Eastern European friends only too well. As an East German, I am also half-Eastern European. I understand that Eastern Europe cannot immediately catch up on every step of environmental policy that has been taken in the Western European countries in recent decades. In order to get high-level environmental protection, one has to be able to afford it. Yes, that is true. However, I think that – even if we allow for this – it is worth approving this compromise, because it will do justice to the different starting positions that many Member States find themselves in.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the argument that the use of best available techniques will endanger competitiveness, in particular, with respect to China, is not only false; it is also dangerous. We must deal with the fact that industrial processes in Asia are always cheaper than here. However, we will only meet this challenge if we implement best available techniques in as many branches of industry as possible. Those which do not do this will become less competitive.</p>
      <p sl="de">No one, including this law, is demanding that an industrial enterprise should be switched off tomorrow. No one is demanding a leap from 0 to 100 in order to achieve a particular pollutant limit within a week. We have enough transitional periods, but to say that we must go without for competitive reasons is false. I also think that with this directive, we have set a course not only for environmental policy, but also for industrial policy, a course for which it is worth working in the next few years.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to welcome the trialogue conducted on the subject of the proposal for an industrial emissions directive. Europe needs a policy which will take into account the modernisation capabilities of the industrial installations in every Member State. The majority of provisions included in the text of the directive reflect a necessary adjustment aimed at ensuring that economic operators in the energy industry which need time to comply with the new regulations can continue to operate. In this respect, derogations are extremely important, and can be made on the basis of clear criteria that need to be outlined by the Commission based on guidance.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the moment, we are witnessing tentative development of alternative energy resources in certain regions. This maintains considerable dependency on fossil fuels. We must find solutions enabling us to invest in state-of-the-art energy production facilities in the least polluting way possible. We must also facilitate the transition of workers from polluting industries, such as coal mining, to other economic sectors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Commission must ensure that the latest generation technologies for energy production are distributed uniformly throughout the whole of Europe by providing logistical and financial support, where needed, to Member States which still do not have the necessary resources for investing in such projects.</p>

      <p sl="de">Industrial activity requires a high level of environmental protection. This is particularly true for the prevention of air and water pollution, but also for biodiversity. At the moment, the European rules on industrial environmental protection are too fragmented and do not yet achieve the desired degree of usage of best available techniques to raise the level of environmental protection. As a result of this, it is of particular concern that we make utilisation of the best available techniques the rule rather than the exception. The main strategy emerging as a result is to combat environmental pollution at source. With the recast and the renewed discussion of these rules, important steps have been taken towards restricting the possibilities for exemption and reducing bureaucracy, which is particularly relevant for SMEs. Apart from this, the Commission has the task of regularly checking whether further Europe-wide uniform requirements are needed for individual activities and plants, and reporting on this to the Council and to Parliament. It is also requested to support and monitor the Member States in implementing the measures. In this regard, cooperation with European confederations of industry, SMEs and NGOs plays an important role. The second implementation report in 2019 will show whether the application of best available techniques in the EU has really become the rule, in order to ensure a high degree of environmental protection in the industrial sector.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The legislative process of the directive on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control), which is important for the whole of the EU, is slowly drawing to a close. However, it should be emphasised that not all Member States are able to implement it. From Poland’s point of view, if adopted in its present form, the directive could have serious consequences for industry and district heating plants. Losses to industry may be as high as PLN 50 billion. Implementation of the directive will also have an adverse effect on thousands of Polish businesses. Reducing the level of pollution to the proposed value will mean many old plants will have to be replaced by new ones, which is a bigger problem than reducing carbon dioxide emissions. However, in the case of district heating plants, the directive provides for a transitional period for adapting to Union standards until 2019. This is four years shorter than Poland had expected. Extending the transitional period would make technological conversion easier for small heating plants. Introduction of the directive will also affect the lives of ordinary citizens. According to estimates made by the Polish Ministry of the Environment, introduction of legislation on industrial emissions will cause a 20% rise in the price of heat, and the costs of using electricity will also rise. In view of the above, the recommendation for second reading of the industrial emissions directive should be rejected.</p>

    <intervention id="2-608" speaker_id="4346" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the common position adopted by the Council at first reading with a view to adopting the European Parliament and Council Regulation setting out the obligations of agents selling wood and products made of wood (rapporteurs: Satu Hassi and Caroline Lucas) (05885/4/2010 - C7-0053/2010 - 2008/0198(COD)) (A7-0149/2010).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Mrs Hassi is to be thanked for having picked up working on this report, which was already under way, the original rapporteur being Mrs Lucas, who gave up her seat to take up other responsibilities in the British Parliament.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-609" speaker_id="28321" name="Satu Hassi" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the original rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, along with the negotiators from the other political groups, very sincerely for their exceptionally high levels of cooperation. My thanks also go to Spain, which headed the talks in the Council of Ministers, and the Commission. Both the Commission and the Council altered their original views significantly, and the EU will now shut down its market in illegally harvested timber. This breakthrough, which is of global importance, would not have been possible without the support of a strong majority in Parliament for a ban on illegal timber.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Now, a clear ban has been agreed on operators that place timber or timber products on the EU market for the first time. These operators must be aware of the wood’s origin. Retailers have an obligation to record where they have purchased the wood or timber product and where they have sold it on. In this way, it is possible to discover, for example, the origin of wood used for furniture.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament would have liked a ban on the entire chain, and not just the first seller. The regulation negotiated, however, contains guidelines requiring subsequent links in the sales chain and monitoring organisations not to act against the aims of the law. All parties must therefore take responsibility for ensuring that no illegal timber is sold in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am sorry that the Council did not agree to list this regulation under the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law. I would appeal strongly to the Commission that it should rework the directive as soon as possible to apply also to the latest environmental legislation. The most blatant breaches of the ban on the sale of illegal timber should be treated as crimes.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament’s negotiators were concerned about the concept of negligible risk that came out of the Council’s insistence on a statutory text. We examined the sort of contexts in which this concept occurs in current legislation. It seems to mean a risk that is, to all intents and purposes, zero, in laws that concern such issues as genetically modified micro organisms, BSE (mad cow disease), food hygiene, cosmetics, pesticides, etc. Parliament therefore accepts the concept of negligible risk, understanding it to mean a risk that is, to all intents and purposes, zero.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With respect to the shortcomings that remain in the act, I would still like to mention the fact that printed matter is excluded from its scope of application. I fear that this could turn out to be a huge loophole, and one that will grow in size, and an incentive to outsource the printing of books and magazines to countries such as Turkey and China.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A total of 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation, and a part of that by illegal harvesting. Illegal harvesting also destroys biodiversity. It is because of this that we are losing, for example, potential medicines before there is even a chance to study them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">For years, the EU has preached against illegal timber, though at the same time hypocritically providing it with it one of the biggest markets there is. Despite the grand speeches, the EU has, through its actions, promoted the destruction of the world’s natural forests. The fact that the EU is now to prohibit placing illegally harvested timber on the market is a globally significant breakthrough and an excellent example of how the EU can, again through its own actions, be part of the solution to what is a global problem. This legislation is a way for us to support all those countries that wish to curb illegal harvesting in their own territory.</p>

    <intervention id="2-610" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank the European Parliament and, in particular, both rapporteurs, Mrs Caroline Lucas and Mrs Satu Hassi, and the shadows for their engagement with the Council and Commission, which has resulted in the compromise text we have before us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Forests are of vital importance in maintaining biodiversity and in global climate and water cycles. Nowhere are the three pillars of sustainable development clearer than in relation to forests. In addition to their environmental value, the economic and social value of forests is immense, as I know well from my own country in which forests cover almost 60% of our territory. In many developing countries, forests provide not only jobs but also medicines, food and shelter that are critical for the subsistence of millions of rural people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your vote should pave the way for a second-reading agreement that will send a clear signal to the world: the EU will not accept illegally harvested timber. The challenge remains as to how we detect illegally harvested timber. By itself, the regulation is not enough to tackle illegal logging as it only covers timber on the EU market. The EU will continue to engage with countries wishing to strengthen forest governance, in particular through FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements. I am glad that the text before us recognises the efforts of countries entering into such agreements with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">To those who say that this proposal is a burden to European forest owners, I would say that legitimate operators should not face an undue burden – the text has considerable flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal in front of you deserves your support. It certainly has mine.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-611" speaker_id="28126" name="Christofer Fjellner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Hassi and the other shadow rapporteurs. We were a long way from an agreement when we started this work, and I believe that we still have different views on certain aspects. However, I must say that we worked well together. I would also like to thank the Spanish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I had three things in mind when working on this issue. Firstly, that timber is a wonderful and renewable material that we use too little rather than too much. The legislation that we are now laying down must not create more problems or bureaucracy for those who use, and trade in, timber. We must not impose higher requirements on timber than we do on oil, for example. If this legislation results in someone choosing to produce products from plastic instead of timber, then it will be the environment that will suffer the most.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, it must be possible to implement the legislation. Many of the proposals that we have seen while we have been working on this, and that we have thrown out, have quite simply been impossible to implement. The legislation must not cover recycled material, nor must it include products that are far too complicated or impose excessive regulations on operators that are far down the product chain. It is not acceptable to demand that a table containing chipboard be labelled with the origin of the individual fibres, or to force a book seller to guarantee workers’ rights in connection with the felling of the trees from which the fibres in the books come.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The third point that I had in mind is that the legislation must not become a pretext for a new wave of protectionism. The export of timber and timber products was an important factor in Sweden becoming rich once upon a time. We must not prevent other countries that are currently poor from exporting and trading. Therefore, the requirements that we set for what we import must not be so high that, in practice, we exclude developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">After working for several years on this matter, I have to say that the compromise that we have today is as far as we can go. Many of my objections have been heard, for which I am very grateful. I think the proposal we will vote on tomorrow is very much better than the one I actually voted against last May. I think that we have achieved a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would just like to remind my fellow Members of one thing, and that is that when we talk about illegal trade in timber and timber products, we need to remember the main causes of this and continue to combat them: unclear ownership rights, corruption and poverty. This must not become an excuse to stop the important work of combating corruption, as that is the main problem.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, today’s debate and tomorrow’s vote are truly an emotional moment, an historic moment. I see many friends here who fought hard with us. We have now just about managed to bring the Council round to Parliament’s initial positions, and we have before us a piece of legislation which protects both European citizens and European producers.</p>
      <p sl="el">Until now, European citizens buying timber or timber products had no way of knowing if they were legal or illegal and if, in buying them, they were subsidising bloody civil wars financed through illegal felling or climate change through deforestation. Now, with this legislation and thanks to Parliament’s efforts, we have managed to get the Council to agree with the obvious, by which I mean that illegal timber should also be considered illegal in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have also managed to centralise, through the European Commission, the control inherent in the terms, approval and authorisation on the part of the operators who will supervise legal timber evaluation systems and approve timber products. We have also managed, when each operator examines if timber is legal, to include legislation on biodiversity and numerous other matters.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nonetheless, there are two crucial points which the Council did not accept and which, in my opinion, are critical. The Council refused to accept the obvious, that being the first to import illegal timber and timber products on to the European market should be an infringement included in the directive on environmental crime. This is absolutely absurd. As is the fact that the concept of negligible risk has been retained, thereby opening a back door to certain activities which do not need to comply with the procedures provided for in the legislation. However, this legislation protects European citizens and European producers from unfair competition from cheap illegal timber.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to thank my associates who worked on this issue, such as Alexandros Kandalepas and his staff.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, you see before you a very happy man, and not only because of the Dutch team’s victory against Uruguay in the semi-final. It is also because today we are sending a very strong signal to the rest of the world. Five hundred million Europeans no longer want to use illegally harvested timber, and those who do attempt this practice will be punished. This is a very important signal on the part of the European Union, and should not be underestimated. Deforestation – both legal and, in particular, illegal – remains a major problem in the world. The European Union is now making effective use of one of its strongest powers, the power of 500 million consumers. Fair is fair, however: this signal is actually only effective thanks to the European Parliament. The Council wanted to deter the use of illegally harvested timber, whilst the European Parliament wanted to prohibit it: an important distinction. As far as I am concerned, this is a great victory for democracy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to thank the Spanish Presidency – regrettably, not even the Belgian Presidency is present – for the work it has done to obtain majority support in the Council for a prohibition on the import of illegally harvested timber. I call on the Council – regrettably absent – to set to work on proper enforcement of this regulation, as that will ultimately be the key to its success. Unfortunately, if it is not enforced effectively, it will be a paper tiger.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Hassi and her predecessor, Mrs Lucas, most warmly for their excellent cooperation. This also goes for the shadow rapporteurs. In my opinion, Parliament has set an example of how it can operate and express its democratic power.</p>

      <p sl="en">The agreement is strict enough to ensure real strides in the protection of forests and biodiversity, but also flexible enough not to be over-burdensome for legal and honest traders. We would do well not to underestimate the success there. It is possible to come to such agreements when we all work together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to highlight one of the very welcome side effects. It follows on nicely from what Jan was just saying. For me, a very welcome side effect of taking a dossier like this through Parliament is the huge effect on public awareness. Certainly in the UK, it has widened out beyond what I might call the usual suspects, the green environmental groups, and has engaged the wider public. For me, as a very new MEP, it has brought unprecedented contact with the public, all of whom are supporting Parliament and, I think, are impressed that Parliament has been able to move this subject in the direction in which they want to see it going.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs of this excellent work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we know, deforestation is one of the planet’s main environmental and social problems, and each year we lose 13 million hectares of forest, thereby contributing 20% of global carbon emissions and constituting an enormous threat to biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Deforestation’s contribution to climate change is undeniable and, as such, is a major cause of extreme weather events and floods, and even of the desertification of vast areas of the planet. The loss of forest puts all humanity at risk, but this risk and this impact is not shared equally by all of us. The communities with the least resources and those that depend most on the forest and nature to survive are those most affected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Deforestation is linked to our collective existence, the scarcity of natural resources, their distribution, the rights of local and indigenous communities, and social justice. The main cause of deforestation is illegal logging, which accounts for 20 to 40% of the world’s industrial timber production. We are therefore also talking about the transfer of wealth from the producer to the countries consuming this timber. This illegal practice places sustainable timber exploitation and the companies involved in it at risk.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Nice sounding words are not enough. Parliament must adopt strong and consistent measures in this fight. This report takes a very important step in this direction by defining prohibitions on timber trading.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Good intentions are not enough either. Effective means are needed, particularly penalties, which could be of three types in this case. Firstly, fines that eliminate any financial benefit from the illegal practice, to be increased for repeat offenders; secondly, the confiscation of the timber and any products in question, and; thirdly, the immediate suspension of authorisation to exercise any commercial activity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why those exploiting or trading a natural resource must be socially responsible, and that is why those importing timber or timber products into the European Union for the first time must be investigated to ensure that the timber has come from legal sources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is also why all subsequent operators must supply basic information on this timber, namely its origin and its destination. The public must also have the right – and I am ending here, Mr President – to access information on those in compliance and those who are not.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, my thanks to Mrs Hassi, who has quickly acquainted herself with a complicated subject. I would just like to mention a few of the many areas that the report deals with: the illegal importing of timber into the EU, endangered tree species that are felled illegally in remote parts of the world and the importing of finished products manufactured in countries outside the EU. If we are talking about timber that has been produced in European forests and that has been legally felled, it is not difficult to obtain information on the country in which the timber was felled, the species of tree, the quantities and value in order to be able to place a legal logging mark on a product. However, how far back should we trace timber, and which products is it realistic to check? I am thinking about furniture consisting of MDF and chipboard that is made of recycled wood, for example. We need to produce realistic legislation, otherwise we will only succeed in making European companies unable to compete any more on a global level and causing them to move far away from Europe’s well-intentioned standards and controls. I hope that, with this proposal, we will be able to prevent that from happening.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The result that has been achieved is a lot better than the disadvantages of the compromise, but I want to point out, as the rapporteur, Mrs Hassi, did, that the major drawback with this is the absence of sanctions, at European level and at a minimal level, and also that at this stage, the regulation is not included in the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law, either in respect of illegal harvesting or in the trade associated with it. I hope that the Commission will put forward proposals relating to this as soon as possible. In the same way, it will be vitally important to include printed matter in the regulation in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is very late now and I do not think I should distract us from the idea that this relates to one of the most important votes we will have this week in this Parliament. It is important for our citizens, judging by my postbag and the number of e-mails I have received. There is an online petition, which, about four hours ago, had 125 000 signatures – and the number is going up every minute – urging us to stick with this proposal tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important for the climate, as everyone has mentioned, but I think, as the Commissioner has said, it is most important for the millions of people who live in the world’s poorest countries and whose livelihoods are being destroyed by illegal logging. Let us take Madagascar, where 100 000 rosewood trees were illegally chopped down last year, each tree worth more than the average GDP in that country. No wonder illegal logging fuels criminality in Madagascar. The civil war in Liberia, mainly funded through illegal logging, killed 250 000 people. It fuelled the war in Cambodia in the 1990s and it is the enemy of democracy. Global Witness calculates that 15 tonnes of timber crosses from Burma to China every seven minutes, helping to prop up that despicable regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Illegal logging deprives millions of people of a better chance in life because billions of dollars are lost in tax revenues to governments. Human Rights Watch says that USD 2 billion have been lost in tax revenues in Indonesia. That is enough to provide basic heath care for 100 million people in that country and is more than the entire health budget of that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what we are doing today is a first step. It is not perfect, as the Commissioner has admitted, but it is a lot better than where we started off with a kind of voluntary code with which we would have due diligence. I would like to thank the Commissioner for going further than his predecessors. I would like to thank the Spanish Presidency for pushing for this agreement and I would like to thank Hilary Benn, the former UK Secretary of State, for sticking his ground in Council and pushing for a more ambitious agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Tomorrow, we will make a start. I think Satu Hassi and the shadows have done a very good job, but we have to maintain consumer pressure and public awareness. I hope the Commission will also play a role in doing that and in getting good enforcement of this very important new law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the world’s forests are being destroyed – sometimes with the support of governments, but often through illegal activities. The drugs trade and the timber trade are two activities that can generate such enormous amounts of money that they corrupt governments, which makes enforcement hugely difficult. Five years ago, I took the case to Louis Michel, the Commissioner at the time, and said we needed a measure like this. He was sympathetic, but his services and lawyers said it could not be done. I would say to the Commissioner that there is an important piece of advice there, which is that if the lawyers say it cannot be done, then change the lawyers. It can be done, and here we have proof of it. This is excellent, this is good news and an important measure.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this directive requires that Member States introduce enforcement regimes which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive. What does that mean? What if Slovenia says that the penalty for illegally importing wood will be 10 years’ imprisonment, and the United Kingdom says it will be a slap on the wrist? How do you ensure that this legislation will be put into effect properly across the whole of the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, I would ask you to write to Member States and tell them that you are going to start publishing details of the penalties they put in place to ensure that this legislation is properly enforced, and that you will name and shame in a way that has never been done before. One sees the words ‘effective, proportionate, dissuasive’ time and time again. I would like you to be the first Commissioner to actually ensure that those words have proper effect.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think that we are making good legislation today. It is good and right that we are taking steps to avoid illegal timber being placed on the European internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, what holds for all environmental laws also holds for this law: we cannot just put in what we want, but we must also always check whether what we put in and prescribe is feasible in the end. Therefore, I think it is right that we have, in the end, come to the compromise that due diligence only needs to take effect at the first instance of placing on the market, and also that only then can the import ban be issued.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would be much too bureaucratic to provide documentary evidence of origin throughout the entire supply chain within Europe. This was on the table at the beginning of the debate. I think that it is not realistic here to constantly keep new accounts and provide documentary evidence, from the timber yard and the sawmill right up to the furniture factory. This produces bureaucracy which, in case of doubt, produces more paper and thereby may even accelerate legal felling. Therefore, we must be moderate in this area and ensure balance. We have succeeded in doing this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not in favour of the approach that Mrs Hassi has just spoken of, namely that we can bring in a zero-risk policy. This is not only applicable to felling, and it will not work. Zero risk is not feasible. It produces bureaucracy and, above all, produces new risks. We must ensure that the laws remain balanced and feasible. In this sense, this compromise is a good one. I am pleased that we will be able to approve it with a large majority tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, this illegal harvesting of forests must be stopped and we have to fight against it. We are surely all unanimous on that issue. I cannot, however, support this compromise in all respects, for example, where it concerns each operator in the chain being in a certain way responsible for verifying the origin of the wood. In my view, this is connected with the very considerable fear that this will increase bureaucracy both for forest entrepreneurs and owners. That should not be the purpose at all.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we implement this regulation, we must also ensure that the very comprehensive certification system already in place in several countries is valid and that we do not start to create an overlapping verification method that again adds to bureaucracy and, in a way, weighs down our competitiveness in the forestry sector. It is also important that we do not accord timber a status that is inferior to other materials. That, too, is now something to make us apprehensive.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the issue that we have before us is a very important one, and it is easy to agree with what has been said here this evening. At the same time, as Mrs Manner just said, in this work we are starting to lose sight of the fact that we have very sustainable forestry production and forestry activity in northern Europe, particularly in the Nordic countries. Unfortunately, we are forgetting this fact in our implementation of the important objectives that we had to prevent the import of illegal timber to the European market. This is an important example of how we should not work.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am grateful that Mrs Hassi and others worked well in the trialogues, and therefore I, too, will be able to vote in favour of this tomorrow. At the same time, we need to learn from this, that when we do something important, as we are about to do here, and as we are also doing now, and finally produce a good regulation that prevents the import of illegal timber, we must not forget that it might have an effect on our own production within precisely this sector. We have quite a bit to do in this area in the future. We must try to avoid the sorts of problems that we have in connection with this issue in particular.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The trade in timber purchased illegally or through illegal logging has pushed down the price of timber and contributed to the impoverishment of forests. This is why it is imperative for Europe to improve the legislative framework in this area. The new feature of this regulation, namely, the introduction of the due diligence and control system operated by accredited monitoring organisations at EU level, will provide an additional filter for verifying the legality of placing timber materials on the market. However, it is not a perfect solution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There are options for bypassing even this system. This is why, as part of the debates in the competent committee, I proposed an amendment whereby monitoring organisations will automatically lose their accreditation if the competent authority notes the operators’ failure to implement an efficient due diligence system. The content of this report is unarguably a particularly important step towards combating the placing of timber obtained illegally on the market. However, further measures are …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, 2010 is the year of biodiversity, and with the regulation before us, an important provision will be created for measures against climate change and for the preservation of biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU can no longer offer a market for timber and timber products from illegal felling, as this illegal felling is a significant cause of deforestation. After all, 20% to 40% of worldwide industrial timber production comes from illegal sources. Around 13 million hectares of forest are deforested every year, as we have already heard today. Twenty per cent of worldwide CO2 emissions are can be attributed to this deforestation, and they are a leading cause of the loss of biological diversity. By providing an absolute ban within the European market on illegally felled timber or products manufactured from it, the European Union is showing that it takes its responsibility for preserving biodiversity seriously.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The position of the European Parliament formulated in the report of Caroline Lucas is correct and decent, and should therefore be supported. It is not possible to accept the continuing tolerance shown by the governments of some European countries towards the trade in illegally harvested timber, or the way in which they avoid imposing penalties for this activity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">After a detailed examination of the positions of European Union governments concerning the regulation in question, it is hard to know whether some governments represent the views of their citizens more than the views of the business mafias who profit from the illegal harvesting of timber. The fact that some governments are not interested in suppressing the illegal grey or black economy should not be an obstacle, and should not lead us to tolerate the vandalistic looting of forests.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is late and I will try to make it short, but not because the issues are less important. On the contrary, it is because of the high level of consensus in the room.</p>
      <p sl="en">Forests are at the heart of the battle against climate change and at the heart of the battle for protecting biodiversity. Together with the recent Regulation on illegal, unregulated and unrecorded fishing, this means that in the European Union, we will have the instruments to counter illegality in two of our key natural resources: fisheries and forests. And, yes, it is also an important part of the fight against poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The impact of the regulation depends on effective implementation, and the challenge is far from over. However, today we can start to appreciate the fact that a solution on this difficult, but important, file has been found. We are clearly dealing with a proposal of a noble nature. I am looking forward to engaging in the implementation and enforcement process together with you.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate at this late hour. I was involved in the situation to which Mr Davies referred: in a discussion with the European Commissioner for Development Cooperation at the time, in which he said that he thought that legislation such as that which we have now been negotiating would be impossible. I am glad that we have made possible what he thought impossible at the time.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Both the Commissioner and the other Members have duly spoken about all the types of harm that illegal harvesting causes. Many have been and are concerned about bureaucracy. I would like to remind everyone, however, that the bureaucratic demands on all those except the first party to place timber or timber products on the market are extremely modest: simply that they should know and can prove where it was bought and where it has been sold on. The companies should have the documents needed for this in any case. It is required, for example, under the laws on VAT.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am pleased that many companies, in the packaging and furniture industries, for example, have supported the ban on illegal timber. I have also received messages from wood industry trade unions that are in support of this and which talk about the harm to competition due to the fact that there is too much illegal timber on our market. As has been said here, this law must be implemented properly, and I am also seriously in favour of keeping a record of what sort of sanctions the Member States enact. They need to be genuinely effective in the prevention of malpractice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Nowadays, 20-30% of industrial timber production worldwide is from illegal sources. We need to clean up the European timber market as soon as possible. While it could still be improved, the proposed regulation is ambitious and courageous. In my view, it is an effective tool for limiting rampant deforestation, without imposing administrative constraints on our European companies or harming timber, which will, on the contrary, become more highly valued.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The regulation establishes a binding provision which delegates responsibilities on the basis of the ‘due diligence system’. This allows operators to trace timber and timber products, to access information on observance of the applicable legislation and, thus, to obtain sufficient guarantees to prevent the sale of products from logging considered to be illegal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The obligations contained in the regulation must target those operators who place timber on the market for the first time, because that is when there is the most risk. Furthermore, in order to guarantee that this regulation is effective, we should emphasise the need for regular controls and a system of stringent, deterrent penalties for offenders.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is a well-known fact that every year, in various countries of the world, thousands of hectares of forest disappear without being replaced. In many cases, we see illegal extraction even in European Union countries. Even in advanced countries such as the Czech Republic, timber is stolen by selective extraction or clear cutting without the knowledge of the owner. Commercial forests, of course, not only have an environmental role, but, as the term ‘commercial forest’ suggests, also have the role of producing timber. It is important for legislation to pay heed to the restoration of an optimal mix of tree types in forests. This is linked to the management of animals, especially the taller ones. It is appropriate to resolve these questions at the corresponding national or regional levels. Not even the best directive can have an impact on the damage caused to the economy of individual regions through the export of all kinds of timber outside the borders of the regions. In my opinion, the proposals contained in the European Parliament report are in accordance with the existing opinions of this supreme lawmaking body of the Community, and it would be appropriate to give full support to the report. The accelerated implementation of the regulation, the penalties in case of a breach of the regulations and the ban on trading are a necessary minimum. The attempts by some governments to take an extreme liberal approach in this sector are outrageous, and may damage the national economies of the states which uphold them on the Council. The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left will certainly support the rapporteur’s proposals.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Illegally harvested timber and timber products have no place on our market. As far as I am concerned, the sale of timber should be permitted only if it has been established on the basis of credible standards that the timber has not been harvested illegally or unsustainably. My appeal would be for us to think beyond the environment and the climate and consider countries where so-called ‘legal’ deforestation is depriving local populations of their livelihood. This is also a human rights issue. Today, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) can show what it really means by stewardship and charity. The EPP Group wanted to decrease the protection of local populations by hiding behind the low moral standards of legislators in third countries, who allow their people to be exploited by facilitating large-scale deforestation or failing to combat it effectively. Last week, Dutch television showed how our energy companies profit from coal mining in South Africa. The spokespeople of these companies were turning a blind eye; they lacked the courage to be publicly accountable. Similar practices occur in the deforestation sector. We must eradicate these root and branch. The EPP Group cannot use the lack of effective laws and ethical codes as an excuse to switch off its own conscience. Large-scale logging drives people from the areas where they live. I endorse the environmental and climate targets, whilst also advocating protection of human rights.</p>
