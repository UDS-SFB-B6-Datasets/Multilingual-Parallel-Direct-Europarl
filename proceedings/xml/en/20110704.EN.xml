      <p sl="unknown">Last Friday in Warsaw we inaugurated the first Polish Presidency of the European Council in the presence of President Van Rompuy and President Barroso. The European Parliament expects that it will be as amenable to our Parliament as the Hungarian Presidency. On Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Donald Tusk will present the Polish Presidency’s work programme, so we will meet the Polish Presidency on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">There are two pieces of news concerning our nearest neighbours. We are following events in the EU’s closest neighbours. In a referendum held on Friday, the citizens of Morocco approved amendments to the constitution strengthening the democratic nature of the country’s regime. However, these reforms must continue and be farther-reaching, so that they reflect the true aspirations of Moroccans. I would like to add that representatives from the European Parliament were present as observers during the election.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The next issue concerning our neighbours is as follows. During yesterday’s peaceful demonstrations which took place in many towns throughout Belarus, hundreds of people were arrested and have been put on trial today. The European Parliament supports the citizens of Belarus in their efforts to enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all those arrested and sentenced for political reasons.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">News has reached us of the death of Otto von Habsburg. Otto von Habsburg-Lothringen was one of the first promoters of European integration and a co-author of the idea of Pan-Europa. For many years he was Chairman of the International Paneuropean Union, the oldest European integration movement. For two decades, as a member of the European People’s Party, he was also a keen proponent of expansion of the EU to include the countries of Eastern Europe. A former Member of the European Parliament has left us.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 25 June another of our fellow Members, Jan Kułakowski, a former member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, died. As a Polish emigrant at a time when the Communist regime was still in power in Poland, he was Secretary-General of the World Confederation of Labour for 14 years. While I was Prime Minister, he was the chief EU membership negotiator for four years. Jan Kułakowski contributed greatly to the fact that Poland can now preside over the activities of the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Two outstanding Europeans with very different biographies have left us. Their lives were linked by the idea of a peaceful reintegration of our whole continent. They have left us, but their legacy to future generations, including all of us seated in this House, remains. The way that Europe changed in their lifetime is proof of how much can be achieved even when the starting point is one of crisis and difficulty. Let us not forget their input into the European idea. We will build on their achievements.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (COM(2010)0484 – C7-0265/2010 – 2010/0250(COD)) (A7-0223/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="1-020-000" speaker_id="1928" name="Werner LANGEN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="27-11-1949" birth_place="Müden/Mosel" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my task is to report to you on the decision by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in respect of the regulation on derivatives. Nearly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and two years since the G20 decisions, we now have a regulation on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and money-market products that is ready for a decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would first like to thank everyone who has contributed to enabling the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to come to a unanimous decision: my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs, the staff of the secretariat, but above all Commissioner Barnier, whose proposal laid the foundation that enables us to pass a rational, strict and effective regulation on derivatives. I would also like to thank the Hungarian Presidency, which has worked day and night to bring the very conflicting positions in the Council closer to each other. Regrettably, it has not been possible to achieve political agreement. For that reason, the dossier will be handed on to the Polish Presidency of the Council. I am optimistic that, after the summer break, we will succeed in finding a solution relatively quickly under the Polish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the remainder of the procedure, the question arises as to whether we should vote on the legislative text and whether to hold the final vote. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will discuss this again this evening. The two rapporteurs and the chairs of the two largest political groups have indicated to me that they would like to defer the final vote until September in order to maintain room for negotiation with the Polish delegation and not bring about a second reading at the outset.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main points of the report, which are also controversial, concern legal provisions relating to central counterparties, better collateralisation in bilateral contracts, higher initial capital requirements, greater transparency through reporting to a trade repository and the avoidance of market manipulation in connection with derivatives. These are the most important elements. If we look at the volumes concerned, at the end of June the volume of over-the-counter derivatives traded was USD 60 billion in total, while those traded via stock exchanges amounted to USD 67.9 billion. This gives us an inkling of how the issue of OTC derivatives having had no security whatsoever apart from through bilateral agreement was actually one of the main causes of the financial market crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problems that remain concern, firstly, the scope of application. There is admittedly a clear blocking minority in the Council in respect of the Commission’s proposal to restrict the regulation to over-the-counter derivatives. The proposal is also in accordance with the G20 decisions. The US finance minister, however, recently began an initiative to extend the rules to also include derivatives traded on the stock exchange. Parliament has taken a very clear position in opposition to this, and we intend to stick to this line. I believe aligning ourselves with the G20 decisions to be a sensible course of action. My request to the Commission, then, Commissioner Barnier, is that Commission officials and staff also stick very clearly to this line, even if the Council has other suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second area is exclusions from the scope of application. In our view, these exclusions should be kept as narrow as possible. There were many requests for exclusions, including some that were absolutely justified. We have exempted only the Bank for International Settlements in Basel and allowed a transitional arrangement for pension funds in respect of bilateral clearing. Intra-group transactions between parent undertakings and their subsidiaries are to be exempted from the clearing obligation. Various associations have intervened here, wishing exemption for these too. However, let us take the German Savings Banks Association as an example – an association to which the regional banks in Germany with the greatest derivatives risk belong. LBBW is the second-largest German regional bank, and this bank alone reported a derivatives volume of EUR 2.3 billion as at 31 December 2010. This shows that we cannot treat associations in the same way as parent undertakings and their subsidiaries.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third area is clearing thresholds for non-financial counterparties. Here we have agreed that undertakings that are only end-users are to be excluded. One outstanding matter is the recognition of third-country clearing houses. Here we demand reciprocity. I would also like to make it quite clear that where interoperability is concerned – meaning cooperation between different clearing houses – we want to restrict this to cash securities only and to require at least three years’ experience first.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am optimistic that, following the excellent preparatory work by Hungary, the outstanding matters will be resolved under the Polish Presidency. Of the 33 amendments submitted, some are mere technicalities. These concern adaptation to the Treaty of Lisbon, as the proposal was not complete in this respect. The others are essentially amendments which will be able to be resolved when the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs makes its decision. The 13 amendments submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, which would change the scope of application completely, should be rejected. On that note I should like to express once more my very warm gratitude for the constructive cooperation we have enjoyed from all sides of this House.</p>

    <intervention id="1-022-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur, Mr Langen, just highlighted the obligation that we have, with this and a number of other texts, to learn everything we can from this financial crisis. It has been an extraordinarily intense crisis and, despite what some bankers may think, it is not yet over. Their crisis may be over, but the crisis, with its associated economic and social consequences, is not.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have a duty, product by product, sector by sector, market by market, to establish intelligent regulation and effective supervision. We need to do that, but it will not be enough. We also need to ensure that the people of Europe, from whom we are demanding great efforts at the moment, feel that those efforts are fair and equitable, as well as necessary. That is why I was pleased to stand alongside President Barroso a few days ago when the Commission proposed the creation of a tax on financial transactions, and why I am currently working on new rules on certain types of pay and bonuses which can be neither justified nor explained in the present circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us return to the agenda of ambitious reforms that we have undertaken together. Ladies and gentlemen, together with the Council, we have introduced a new supervisory framework, enhanced supervision of rating agencies – the previous arrangements being insufficient – additional capital requirements for our trading book and, as I just mentioned, a first set of rules on pay.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Shortly – in a few weeks’ time – I will present a fundamental text on the bank capitalisation rules required to implement the Basel III measures in July and the bank management and resolution measures in September and, finally, to undertake the major review of the very important Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Market Abuse Directive in early autumn.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have met today to talk about what is, as Mr Langen pointed out, a very important and fundamental issue, namely the regulation on derivatives. Our aim is to improve the functioning of the markets, which, as he said, carry out some EUR 600 000 billion worth of transactions. They were at the heart of the crisis; obscurity was at the heart of the crisis. The timetable for this reform is very important. I said this to the finance ministers again last week. We need to honour and implement the G20 commitments, and we need to do so in particular before the end of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to honour our commitments, therefore, and that is why I am pleased to hear you confirm, Mr Langen, that you have come to an agreement with several groups enabling you to take the few weeks that you need to reach a proper agreement at first reading – I believe that this is possible, and I believe that it is necessary. In particular, an agreement that still needs to be reached on three important issues for the Commission: supervision, scope of application and third countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like briefly to discuss these three points, starting with supervision. I hope that the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the supervisory colleges will continue to play an important role in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are talking about markets and infrastructure that, although not national, are at least European, and even often global. Effective coordination between European regulators is therefore crucial. I believe that the Commission proposal on this point is balanced. It successfully reconciles the Member States’ primary responsibility regarding approval and supervision with the allocation of important tasks to ESMA and the supervisory colleges, as you requested.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point concerns scope, and clearing, reporting and access obligations. I broadly support an enlarged scope for reporting. As regards mandatory clearing, I listened carefully to Mr Langen’s position. A broad scope has both advantages and disadvantages, as we know. Although a broad scope enables us to close certain loopholes in the law and to ensure convergence with the US approach, we cannot ignore the sensitive nature of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For my third point, I would like to say a word about third countries. Let us be clear, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to see the duplication of pointless rules. During my recent visit to the United States – the third in the space of a year – I identified with the finance minister, the regulators and the supervisors the risks of what we called ‘underlaps’, or the gaps between transatlantic legislation, and the risks of overlaps, or the duplication and overlapping of pointless rules. One of the keys to the success of this reform lies in the management of regulatory arbitrage risks and of the extra-territorial impact of third-country legislation on the Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we must stop being naive. Our aim must be to establish a level playing field based on the mutual recognition, but not the extra-territorial application, of third-country law. This is what is meant by sincere and full reciprocity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I note, moreover, that Parliament has adopted amendments aimed at developing a mechanism for coordination with third countries. I hope that we will be able to expand on this discussion during the trialogue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Those are the points I wished to make quickly and precisely, Mr President. I am grateful once again to your rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the very important work he has done with all of his colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and the coordinators from the various groups, whom I also thank.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this proposal has had a lot of attention, partly because there has been lack of transparency and understanding of derivatives, making derivatives a target for demonisation. However, derivatives are widely used for risk management, including by corporate entities engaged in the real economy and by pension funds. Of course it is also true that, like many financial products, they can be abused or made overly complex.</p>
      <p sl="en">The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs was made early in the report’s consideration, and I appreciate the fact that the rapporteur reflected much of it in his report. On matters specific to our committee, we considered it key to dispel notions of retrospective legislation on outstanding contracts, which may well be illegal. However, the retrospective extension of reporting, where this is simple due to electronic records, I consider acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also pleased to see the uptake of the suggestion of FRAND – fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing practices. This can usefully be applied in a range of financial services to achieve openness and competition, while respecting legitimate property rights. We are also pleased to see inclusion of corporate exemptions for legitimate hedging and intra-group exemptions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in one minute may I just quote from the report of the US Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission on OTC derivatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘The biggest financial institutions drove the market and over-the-counter derivatives after these instruments were fully deregulated in 2000. In the wake of that action, the market for these derivatives spiralled out of control and out of sight, growing to USD 673 trillion in notional amount by 2008. We concluded that over-the-counter derivatives contributed significantly to the crisis. The report explains the unlimited leverage, the lack of transparency, the lack of capital requirements, and the concentrations of risk that proved so disastrous. It also lays out how credit derivatives fuelled mortgage securitization and amplified losses from the collapse of the housing bubble. After that collapse, derivatives were in the centre of the storm. Millions of derivatives of all types between systemically important financial firms were unseen and unknown when the financial system nearly collapsed. The obligations hidden from view added to the market uncertainty and escalated the panic we saw in the fall of 2008, leading to government rescues of financial firms.’</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a need to regulate, there is a need for transparency. We congratulate Werner Langen and we will follow.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to use an image much loved by the Commissioner, this is a new brick in the regulatory and supervisory system that he is courageously and effectively putting in place. A new brick, and soon there will be another one, with short selling. To ensure that those bricks are firmly in place, however, we need the Council’s agreement, and that is why I believe we should make the most of the coming days in order to try to make a success of a trialogue that will enable us to reach a decision at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is in favour of postponing the vote on the legislative resolution until the next part-session. Doing so will give the negotiators time to reach a proper agreement. As Mr Langen, who has done a remarkable job in this difficult affair, said, this agreement specifically deals with the role of, and supervision by, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). ESMA is a key element in this financial regulatory system that has been established. The conditions must be in place, at European level, for that authority to carry out all aspects of its role, which is very important in this case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the issue of scope, we support the rapporteur’s proposal to limit it to over-the-counter derivatives and their markets; it is also important to consider the issues of interoperability and of third countries. I would also point out that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in an effort to be practical, believes that there is no point in imposing the provisions retrospectively, except, perhaps, in the case of transactions that are carried out over a long period of time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This system is difficult and complicated, but it is vital if we are to prevent a repeat of the financial crises we have gone through.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to join in thanking Mr Langen and the other Members with whom we have worked to finalise this complex report.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that Mr Langen made a particularly important point when he said that we wish to maintain the scope of this regulation, keeping faith with the mandate of the G20 in Pittsburgh in 2009. The basic objective was to bring the majority of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives onto regulated platforms in order to prevent their continuing exposure to a high level of risk and speculation. When it comes down (as it did) to exchanging or guaranteeing USD 400 million without collateral, that is, without adequate reserves, the risks we are running become clear.</p>
      <p sl="it">Having said that, however, I should also like to raise two problems. The first problem is the relationship with the Council; the second problem is the coherence of the proposal for reform of the financial markets that we must take forward.</p>
      <p sl="it">I raise the problem regarding the Council first and I say it very clearly. The feeling is all too often that the Council represents an obstacle to reforming the financial markets swiftly and well. I hope that the new Presidency will take on this problem because this time too we have to factor in an extension that is due in large measure to positions, difficulties and disputes arising in the Council. It is a problem that also affects the procedure that we wish to follow.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second question relates to the coherence and specificity of the provisions. There is not only the measure on OTC derivatives but also the measure on short selling and other matters. I would like to draw attention to two points: the specific issue of the commodities market, a special market that requires special anti-speculation measures, and the problem of the exposure in derivatives of local authorities in EU countries. I think that these are problems on which Parliament must intervene.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I wanted to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the positive atmosphere he has created in the debates we have been able to have. They have resulted in an ambitious and responsible text on which there is very broad agreement in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to emphasise two points on which we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, presented proposals, and which were subsequently taken up by all the political groups that supported this text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first point concerns harmonisation by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) of the rules on collateral-related competition between clearing houses. We know that one of the great dangers of this text is that risks will be concentrated in clearing houses when they were previously spread around. They will be concentrated in clearing houses, which actually compete with each other by reducing the level of security within the system. No provision was made in the initial Commission proposal to prevent clearing houses competing on the level of security, an important criterion of which is the level of collateral.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point that I wished to emphasise is our proposal to expand Parliament’s text; we have removed the threshold set by the Commission which limited the transmission of information – the reporting of trading information – because not all derivatives will be traded in clearing houses. We have therefore made provision for all information, be it on over-the-counter trading or on trading carried out in clearing houses, to be transmitted to the regulator so that he has an overview of the risks that exist. I hope that the Council will be receptive to this important development of Parliament’s text.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the cornerstone of today’s package on financial products, EMIR, was the focus of global agreement, via the G20, regarding future legislation on derivative instruments. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Dr Langen, and his team for ensuring that the global dimension of this regulation has been considered. I believe that the Langen report has demonstrated that the democratic process, both here in the Parliament and other EU institutions, including the Commission, is working. Although aimed at modifying the use of derivatives through increased transparency of reporting, and, where applicable, reducing counter-party risk through central clearing, this has been an example where the most vocal and persuasive voices shaping this legislation have been those delivering growth and value in the European economy, namely businesses, large and small, from many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report presented to plenary this week considers proportionate responses to different derivative products based on risk, considers the end-users of such products when used for hedging business purposes and takes into account the needs of millions of European savers and pensioners.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must now ensure that technical details, in particular on segregation, third countries and different types of collateral, are suitably addressed. Where there are overlaps on to other legislative reports such as MiFID, MAD and CRD, we must ensure that the principles established in this regulation are delivered throughout and that our European businesses are not at any stage disadvantaged. Such treatment of non-financials must be ensured in subsequent legislation so as not to discourage genuine business hedging, which would have a significant impact on risk management in the real economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Goebbels has just set out very clearly the role that derivatives played in the financial crisis and what scale they possess. In view of this enormous scale, many citizens are calling for such financial products to be taken off the market altogether. We called for that too. However, we realise that such a small political group as ours has no chance of achieving a majority for this. We have to accept that, and we do. Nonetheless, I would like to emphasise once again that we thought it would be sensible to go further in this regard. On the other hand – and I say this to Mr Langen clearly and with respect – in our view the resulting report is acceptable and fair.</p>
      <p sl="de">Three important points from our perspective are the clearing obligation, the authorisation and monitoring of central counterparties and the reporting requirement for derivatives traders. These seem to us to provide an important and capable basic framework and a sound infrastructure that will enable us to arrive at a rational regulation. Moreover, this regulation is essential if we are to be able to levy a financial transaction tax – which is currently a subject of debate – on derivatives transactions. Although we have not succeeded in asserting all our demands, we believe that this report is absolutely worthy of our support.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention one more point that I considered to be particularly important: the reference to the problem of trading in food commodities and the associated speculation. We were only able to include this reference in the recitals; Mr Langen was prepared to do this. This point will come up again as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) progresses.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, our party has already given this matter some consideration, but I do not have enough time to go into things to any degree right now. We do have some ideas for different ways of working with the financial markets, and how the things that derivatives are used for can, to some extent, be achieved by other means. It would take too long to explain all this at this juncture. However, I should be happy to provide you with more information in this connection.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am now speaking about the aspects relating to economic and monetary affairs rather than legal affairs. There are two prongs to this legislation: first, clearing derivatives through central counter-parties. So there will not be the situation that prevailed after Lehman went down, where it took a long time to sort out who owed who what, although it is worth pointing out that matters were, by and large, sorted out. The second aspect is reporting of all derivatives to a central registry. So, in future, there will be a much better understanding of the level and ownership of derivative contracts, and an alert will be given if it seems there is a build-up of systemic risks.</p>
      <p sl="de">The comparison with US legislation has and will be taken seriously in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage. Equivalence, not sameness, is the key, as we are not the US and there are important differences between our legislative processes and theirs. For instance, the powers of rule-making devolved to ESMA cannot be as wide as for their US counterparts, and conduct of business aspects in the EU belong to MiFID and MAD.</p>
      <p sl="de">I support exemption of foreign exchange from clearing, since there are already settlement procedures through CLS Bank that cover the risk. I also support the exemption of pension funds from the clearing obligations. This should continue until the collateral problem has been solved. Here we do have a difference from the US in that their CCPs accept a wider range of collateral so that their pension funds are not caught in the expensive cycle of asset conversion that would apply under EMIR.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also hear a lot about horizontal versus vertical silos. What is important to my group is open access and the efficiency that competition provides. We need to ensure that there is not unfair profiteering, because the costs incurred in the financial system in general take their toll on the real economy and real people.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over-the-counter derivatives have been portrayed as representing a sort of uncontrolled jungle without rules, in which speculators and fraudsters have operated undisturbed.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report seems to bring a bit of clarity to the sector, starting with the storage of trading data, lifting the veil of darkness that until now has been present in the market. The requirement for central counterparty clearing is undoubtedly useful to prevent risks and promote the overall stability of the financial system. However, it is a good thing to exempt non-financial companies from this requirement – truly productive ones, I mean – as they can have recourse to derivatives to hedge specific risks, for example those linked to changes in exchange rates. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should also play a decisive role. We hope that it proves equal to the task and does not turn out instead to be just a bureaucratic European superstructure.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report fits into a context of a broad international review of the sector, following common guidelines. The financial markets are one of the most interconnected things that exist at a global level and it is therefore necessary to act in as concordant a climate as possible. For the same reason I think that, for example, the introduction of a tax on financial transactions at an EU level only would be difficult. I am of the view that good regulation, the most extensive regulation possible, of the entire financial sector will work better and certainly be more useful than possible new taxes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, most of us will remember the historic meeting between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan 25 years ago in Iceland, the subject of which was exactly what we need to debate today: disarmament. Looking at what they are capable of, I am astonished that derivatives in their present form – even if constrained somewhat by the current measures – are still defended so vehemently. After all, they have proved themselves capable of triggering an explosion of wealth, but also – it has to be said – of causing extreme destruction. The figures have already been given. My compliments to Mr Langen for having managed to fend off so much attempted influence, including that based on the interests of nation states.</p>
      <p sl="de">Before we get bogged down in the detail, it needs to be said that the main problem has not been solved. The genie is still out of the bottle. As a global community, if you will – insofar as it exists – we are attempting to gradually reduce the risks on the world’s financial markets. In this respect the present report is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but as you mentioned, Mr Langen, the regional banks – squeezed as they are between the savings banks and the financial giants – still represent a huge risk. Great difficulties exist in the private sphere. Neither do I agree with pension funds being let off in the way currently proposed. We can only hope that much more will be done when it comes to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) than has been mooted to date.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the trade in complex financial products of which no one could any longer understand the contents or estimate the risks played an important role in the run-up to the financial and economic crisis. It is therefore a positive development that Commissioner Barnier has brought forward these legislative proposals, as we need to obtain transparency in relation to derivatives trading and securities need to be better hedged. Our rapporteur, Mr Langen, has thus produced excellent work in further elaborating these proposals into an ambitious package that also further develops the foundations that we have laid for the European regulator.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Derivatives must be traded publicly, as that gives regulators more insight into the trade flows between buyers and sellers and improves their ability to assess risks. I am pleased that account was also taken, in the proposals that we will be voting on tomorrow, of the special character of pension funds, which are already subject to very strict risk management legislation. The issue of risks is dealt with differently there. As things stand, in pension funds there must not be any speculation and the risk must be hedged. They also have to comply with the requirements governing transparency and openness, although not with the clearing obligation – and fortunately that exception has been soundly elaborated in this proposal. The proposal provides for a temporary and partial exception that provides the leeway to find a solution based on a few years of practical experience, whereupon it will then be up to the Commission to determine whether we have found such a solution or whether the period in question will have to be extended.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I hope that in this regard, as well as in other regards, the Council – which has still not been able to reach any agreement – will follow Parliament’s lead so that we will quickly be able to reach a final conclusion to this legislation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, today we are debating the further measures initiated as a result of the experience of the global economic crisis. It is probably wise to attempt to monitor the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, and, where appropriate, to adopt the necessary regulations in respect of excessive behaviour. As with other rules adopted at European level, however, we need to ensure, in attempting to impose the greatest possible level of administration, that there is no detrimental effect on well-functioning mechanisms that are in fact very helpful for fast-moving commercial relations which do not involve any basic risk.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Financial instruments, especially those used in the energy sector, are mostly not linked to speculation, but to real business interests and covering against risk. The new rules on OTC derivatives in the energy sector are intended to help increase stability and transparency on financial markets, while at the same time avoiding cost increases and higher prices for end users. This also means that the obligations imposed by the new rules should apply only to future contracts. I am very much in favour of ensuring that all of these procedures are simplified.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Langen for the immense work he has done while preparing this report. I agree that the strict and unified regulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives is a pressing issue, especially after the successful creation of European financial monitoring systems. Indeed, I would go a step further and venture to say that the execution of these transactions must be regulated in a way transparent to all institutions, national authorities or financial actors carrying out monitoring based on unified provisions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">According to the Commission proposal, it will be mandatory to report trading with OTC derivatives, and the clearing of transactions will be completed with the involvement of central counterparties. The provisions on additional capital requirements are unavoidable, because we cannot allow the potential practice that sees banks pocket the profit by putting money into high-risk investments, and possibly create their capital from depositors’ money.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We can agree with the proposal of the Commission, which touches on the US regulations in many areas. However, it would be worth considering whose responsibility it should be to report to trade repositories. Should it be the responsibility of counterparties, or would it be more efficient if reporting was done by the central counterparty? The question is, where would these trade repositories be and how would they be structured? We could consider a solution which would create a system similar to that of the lobby registry, summarising the data reported to trade repositories in a harmonised system under unified standards. It would be great if we could realise this in Europe. The same principle could be applied to the re-registration of central counterparties, as well. I think it would be appropriate and important to come to an agreement at first reading on this important issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in the financial crash we saw how a shock in one corner of the global financial market, coupled with uncertainty, sent systemic waves across the world. The aim of this regulation is to reduce systemic risk caused by a financial institution’s failure by encouraging central clearing and improving transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not intended to lock non-financial companies out of derivative markets, which they use to reduce exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange, interest rates or raw material prices. Having excluded these companies from this regulation, we must not price them out of these markets when we look at the Capital Requirements Directive later. I would also be concerned if the compromise in this text on what are acceptable liquid assets were to be cut and pasted into the rules on bank liquidity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Like many colleagues, I hear the concerns of our constituents. They see highly volatile markets for food and fuel, yet prices in the shops and the fuel stations seem only to move in one direction. But derivatives allow producers and suppliers to reduce the volatility and it would be wrong to blame such fluctuations solely on derivatives traders. We need to look at economic factors as well as market abuses across physical and financial markets when we look at MiFID and MAD later this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ambition of this regulation is to reduce systemic risk and it would be a mistake if the end legislation contributes to increasing monopoly powers in our markets.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to congratulate Mr Langen and all the shadow rapporteurs insofar as they have brought here a text that they all agree on. I completely agree that serious and careful regulation on derivatives should be put in place to prevent highly speculative and unorthodox behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, derivatives should not be demonised, because when used correctly they are important and useful financial instruments. When approaching regulatory reform, therefore, it is appropriate to do so in a critical manner but to avoid viewing them negatively. We agree that there is every need to introduce control and supervision. National and European supervisory bodies need to be able to assess and monitor the extent and the volume of trading but, at the same time, we must take care not to be overly restrictive by introducing thresholds, conditions and bureaucratic burdens which, from a practical point of view, would frustrate use of such instruments.</p>
      <p sl="it">It was not financial instruments themselves that led to the crisis but rather the lack of supervision and the ill-considered use of such instruments outside the rules, and it is in these areas that action is required. Hence the need for more stringent rules for central counterparties, whether in terms of capital requirements or with regard to the carrying out of their activities, and greater powers for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the Commission over technical standards and clearing rules, to avoid differences from one Member State to another.</p>
      <p sl="it">I applaud the general introduction of information for the purposes of monitoring the situation and obtaining a complete picture of the derivatives market so as to enable preventative action to be taken. Finally, I think that it is important to exempt non-financial entities from certain requirements when they have recourse to the derivatives market in order to hedge the risks associated with their own activities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, our unanimous vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sent out a clear message that in future, derivatives will be regulated at Community level. Mr Langen’s excellent report makes it clear that we will insist that transactions involving derivatives – which until now have often been traded over the counter – are made fully transparent. Excessive trading in derivatives is a potential threat to the financial markets. I welcome the fact that only a few exceptions from the scope of application are being proposed. This will make the directive more effective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives – in other words, their risk assessment and settlement – is to be recorded centrally in future. This will improve transparency in the various markets. It is in the interests of investors that the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should take on a pivotal role. Moreover, the trade repository and the standardisation of the processes should both enable new risks to be identified at an early stage. The Commission is already on board. It is now time for the Council to step up to the mark, so that the Member States finally start singing from the same hymn sheet. That way, we will be able to get the job done properly this autumn. Risk control and market transparency are the cornerstones of a functioning financial services market and provide an excellent basis for the long-term confidence that is needed.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, considering that the entirely unregulated trading of derivatives was quite obviously one of the factors behind the credit crunch, I believe that this proposed regulation is vital if we are to avoid such crises in the future. The fact that derivatives lack transparency means that the nature and extent of risk cannot be identified, posing a threat to financial stability and society as a whole. In this regard, the establishment of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and its role in assessing which derivatives will be subject to clearing are important issues. It is necessary to continue supporting the operations of this institution because they reduce systemic risk to the financial system, including the potential insolvency of closely interlinked parties. All the same, Commissioner, I would urge the Commission to pay special attention in this context to trading carried out by financial institutions on the commodity markets. The involvement of financiers now looks unhealthy, according to all the evidence, and the Commission would do well to consider whether participation in commodity exchanges should be limited to physical traders.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the reality is that more than 80% of derivatives transactions are over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. It will therefore be very difficult to impose controls on the bulk of such derivatives. Neither are these standardised products, and as a result there are complex interdependencies. The impact of this became extremely clear during the financial crisis. OTC derivatives added to the uncertainty in the markets. Details of such transactions were only available to the contracting parties, so the risks could not be assessed. Transparency is therefore important. Contracts should be reported to the trade repository within one day. It would be negligent of us to allow the stability of the financial markets to be jeopardised by opaque products, because trading in derivatives is not a game; rather, it involves bundling risks together in a way that can sometimes have very serious consequences for the real economy. I am thinking here of commodities derivatives in particular.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to thank all of the MEPs, to whom I naturally listened very carefully, for their contribution. All the questions that were asked and the points that were emphasised enhance the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on all these points and the intelligent responses that have been given.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to mention briefly a number of important issues in response to your questions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I should like to thank the Chair, Mrs Bowles, for the very important work that has been done by the Committee on Legal Affairs and for the valuable contribution it has made to several points in the text. Mrs Bowles also helpfully pointed out that derivatives serve a purpose. Banning them outright is no good, and it would also be completely unrealistic; they can serve the real economy. Moreover, that is why – and I say this to Mrs Ford – we have introduced a number of exemptions for when companies use these products to cover themselves against certain risks and to protect their business. However, when companies use these products in the same way as banks, there will be no exemptions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not about banning derivatives, but about ascertaining how they are put together, presented, used, exchanged and covered, which has clearly not been the case in all the years gone by.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Gauzès, Mr Goebbels, Mr Domenici, Mrs Wortmann-Kool and Mr Mann, just now, mentioned the lack of transparency that the rapporteur and I have highlighted and which explains the need for this text. It is clear that the lack of transparency is at the heart of the crisis and that derivatives were actually one of the causes of the crisis because they were not transparent, controlled, cleared or standardised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am grateful to Mr Canfin for having pointed out – and I admit he is right – that a number of points in the Commission text were improved thanks to Parliament. I shall come back to another point raised by Mr Canfin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I recall that Mrs Bowles and Mrs Gáll-Pelcz raised the issue of trade repositories, which will indeed play a central role. They will register all transactions, ladies and gentlemen. Trade repositories are crucial to ensuring that the regulator can work effectively. To this end, we discuss – I was going to say every day – the technical side of things with the United States and the US regulators, in order to guarantee access to information derived from our coordinating mechanisms – Mrs Swinburne raised this point – and full, complete and sincere reciprocity between the US and Europe. We are not there yet, but we are also currently engaged in a voting process connected with the Dodd-Frank Act and the texts that the US regulators may introduce, sometimes even without a legislative measure, and that we here in the Council and Parliament may bring in as well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, I would welcome an agreement to prevent any positions that breach competition rules and hence generate additional costs for the economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I would say to Mrs Bowles that of course there will be no exemptions without a prior assessment by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Canfin, you are right about the need to prevent any prudential competition with regard to the security conditions in which clearing houses must operate. I would also like to say that, on this point, I think it is a good idea for the European Systemic Risk Board to be able to play a part in this supervision. This point will definitely need to be looked at again in trialogue. Mr Gauzès mentioned my concern to build this structure with you and with the Council, brick by brick, product by product. We have here an important – major – brick, when we see the volumes of trade involved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">He also mentioned ESMA. This is a key point; we must use every text we have, ladies and gentlemen, to make this mechanism – one that you sought to introduce by means of a regulation and to equip with powers which we must not backtrack on or erode – as strong and as effective as possible. I am well aware of the attempts to withdraw and defend one’s territory in relation to each of these texts. Like you, I am anxious for ESMA to be able to exercise all the powers and exert all the influence that it has been given, thanks to you in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Domenici mentioned over-the-counter derivatives. Naturally, this is where there is the most risk and the greatest lack of transparency, hence the G20 decision and the Commission proposal. We are of course very mindful of our relationship with the Council, Mr Domenici, and I should like at this point to thank the Hungarian Presidency for all the efforts it has made to advance this text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say a word about a subject that I became interested in a very long time ago, long before I started in this job in fact: commodities. Mr Canfin, Mr Klute, Mr Tošenovský and Mrs Flašíková Beňová, a moment ago, raised the issue of commodities. I wish to say that the text on derivatives is important for this reason too, ladies and gentlemen, because all the derivatives used on the commodity markets, whatever the nature of the commodity, are going to be covered by this requirement for transparency, standardisation and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must not stop there with regard to the issue of commodities and the management of the risks of speculation – I was going to say hyper-speculation – which accelerate price volatility, often at the expense of the most vulnerable populations, particularly in certain African countries. We are going to put forward proposals on position limits and accountability, but the text that you are going to adopt – in a few weeks I hope – and the amendments on which you are going to give your verdict are one way of ensuring transparency and accountability on the commodity markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, Madam President, I should like to say a word about pension funds, as mentioned by Mrs Swinburne and Mrs Wortmann-Kool. We must not create loopholes in the law. We have identified a specific problem presented by these institutions, which are essential for many Europeans, and we will be proposing – as you know – limited transitional measures to deal with this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">With regard to financial conglomerates, there are potential risks arising from multiple uses of capital, management complexity, concentration, conflicts of interest and other so-called group risks when several licences for different financial services are combined. Therefore, financial conglomerates must be placed under supplementary supervision, consolidated at group level.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission intends to improve European legislation on supplementary supervision in two steps. The first step is to address the most urgent issues through amending the current directive and updating several sectoral directives. The second step, probably in 2012, is to present a proposal for a new directive on this supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates, based on a more fundamental debate on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through our joint efforts we, the European Parliament, Council and Commission, now have a good consensus on how to change the current directive at this first step. Our main proposals refer to defining mixed financial holding companies and placing them under supplementary supervision – which includes bringing alternative investment fund managers under the scope of this current directive – introducing the possibility of stress-testing at the level of each financial conglomerate, ensuring that the new European supervisory authorities issue general guidelines regarding supervision of financial conglomerates through the joint committee, amending the Solvency II Directive and improving the transparency of supplementary supervision.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of the second step, our report includes a review clause. We ask the Commission to look into the possibility of placing under supplementary supervision non-regulated entities, in particular special-purpose vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="en">The identification criteria of financial conglomerates owned by wider non-financial groups active in the banking, insurance and investment services sector are materially relevant in the internal market for financial services. The possibility of introducing mandatory stress-testing at a group level must also be considered.</p>

We are going to apply Basel II and Basel III to 8 230 banks here in Europe. In the United States, around 20 banks will be affected. Then, there is a third difference: the existence, here in Europe, of the issue we are discussing – which the rapporteur, Mr Stolojan, expertly addressed just now – namely, conglomerates. They are specific to Europe, which is why the Commission very much welcomes the agreement reached on the proposal on the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FICOD) and wishes to thank those of you who have strived to make a success of this process and especially you, Mr Stolojan, and the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Bowles, Mrs Swinburne, Mr Skinner, Mr Lamberts and Mr Klute.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the Council, I would also like to thank both the Belgian Presidency and the Hungarian Presidency, which made this progress possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Financial conglomerates, bancassurance groups are, I repeat, specific to the European banking set-up. It is a business model that works well. However, the crisis has shown the need, once again, to strengthen certain aspects of FICOD. That is why, in August 2010, the Commission presented this proposal to amend the directive. Thanks to an agreement between Parliament and the Council on these amendments, supervision of financial conglomerates will be greatly improved through the closure of a regulatory loophole. Indeed, by including mixed financial holding companies in the sectoral directives, that is, in the Capital Requirements Directive relating to banks and in the Solvency II Directive on insurers, the highest level of conglomerates will now be supervised more effectively, and that will help, I think, to increase our financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am particularly grateful to your rapporteur, Mr Stolojan, for his decisive contribution, which made it possible to improve the directive in several important areas. Indeed, they were not covered by the Commission’s original proposal. I am referring to stress testing, which he mentioned a moment ago, and to the enhanced role of the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities. All these improvements are in line with the supervision package. The agreement will also extend the scope of supplementary supervision to include asset management companies and hedge funds controlled by a conglomerate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I should also like to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the transparency of group structures, and to say a word about correlation tables, which are a controversial and difficult issue in the trialogues. I greatly appreciate the importance that Parliament attaches to this issue, ladies and gentlemen. At times I struggle to understand the Council’s difficulty in fulfilling its obligation of communicating to the Commission, via traditional transposition measures, these tables showing how the directive in question has been transposed into national law. I believe that this should, by rights, be part of the transposition work carried out by the Member States. I am very pleased to have Parliament’s support on this point. The Commission believes that such tables are an integral part of our efforts to achieve better regulation, and I should like to thank you for including them in the final text, as you are proposing, and as the Commission also initially suggested.</p>

I would like to mention that we cannot send a signal of equivalence of treatment between capital market investors and depositors in commercial banks.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, congratulations to Mr Stolojan and the services, including Mr Van Es – he does not get mentioned very often but he is quite a solid part of our Parliamentary services, he should be thanked. Everyone – at least almost everybody – has worked tirelessly and very hard to get consensus on this law, and the legislation we will vote on will ensure appropriate supplementary supervision of financial groups. This is something that was missing from our discussion on Solvency II and which we knew was very important – as were, we remember, the effects of AIG when they occurred. So it is gratifying that I have heard already from the Commissioner of the transatlantic bearing of this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all know very well what happens when corporations are involved in things which are too complex and too risky. To this end, financial business and other key business are accommodated in this particular report, whether they are banks or insurance or involved in securities. This legislation spreads out the approach to those risks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, may I just mention to you now that transatlantic issues are still alive, and we need to ensure that the financial conglomerates are a part of that discussion, particularly in the TEC. I do not want to sound accusatory, but we are not seeing financial issues discussed in the TEC and we are wondering which side of the Atlantic is being resistant to seeing it discussed. Please come back to me on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the directive itself, you are right: stress-testing, the role of authorities, correlation tables, are notable successes for Parliament. We won them in a hard fight within the trialogues. We should feel justified, therefore, in our relative success in this legislation, which I believe will continue in the interest of better protection of consumers – something that we should come to expect.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, a key feature in the supervision of conglomerates is ensuring that there is avoidance of regulatory repetition, but it is also important to have a level playing field as viewed from the separate sectoral companies with which they compete. This underlines several of the amendments that have been made, and there is the specific point included that all risks are incorporated while eliminating supervisory and prudential overlaps.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Mr Skinner just mentioned, correlation tables are included. Happily, all institutions finally agreed on them being necessary in this instance, because it gets complicated fitting it in to all the other legislation. But, more generally, I reinforce that correlation tables are vital as part of the European supervisory architecture. In the interinstitutional agreement I think we might also have to look at sector-by-sector as well as case-by-case exemptions from whatever is agreed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Inclusion of uniform reporting formats, frequency and dates within two years of adoption of implementing technical standards has also been agreed and will make supervision easier. As has been mentioned, stress tests are included but not yet mandatory. As the rapporteur said, making them compulsory features in the review clause.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also confess that I am a little disappointed that the issue of scope is only in the review clause, in particular looking at the material relevance of the financial part of a large conglomerate rather than just having a threshold. In practice, some Member States may have this under control, but I really do not see why we could not have been bolder at this point in time. As others have said, this is a good outcome, but the next review should be bolder, and we have made the point here of many of the issues that we will wish to see.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Barnier, Mr Stolojan, ladies and gentlemen, we share the opinion that this report is necessary in order to correct a poorly drafted report from 2002 and a poorly drafted Financial Conglomerates Directive. The directive in question was drafted in the spirit that prevailed prior to the crisis, when it was felt that regulation should be less rigid and that exceptions should be permitted. As far as the legislation is concerned, it is right that we have now corrected this.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also right that the Joint Committee of the three supervisory authorities – in other words, those for banking, for insurance and for securities and markets – is now at last being given greater powers in respect of these institutions; overarching powers which extend beyond the segregated area of banking or insurance. What has also become clear, however, is that this principle of segregation into three separate supervisory authorities is no longer appropriate when we look at the actual reality in the financial markets, and that we did not go far enough at the time.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is a pity that the most important and most relevant issues have ultimately ended up only in the review clause. We are therefore hoping for a strong report both from the international financial institutions and also from you, Mr Barnier – from the Commission – and I hope that we will finally get this in the course of the coming year. Our citizens are expecting clear answers when it comes to the issue of financial institutions being too big, too interconnected, to fail. Allowing increasingly complex and opaque financial institutions to come into being is not something to be proud of. We therefore need to make improvements in this area.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the various entities that can be identified as financial conglomerates span a number of fields and are therefore difficult to reduce to a single category and to a single regulatory scope.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the past this situation has created several difficulties, which the financial crisis has further exacerbated. The draft report is therefore going in the right direction to fill a gap that has become increasingly apparent over time. The newly established European Supervisory Authorities supervising the markets, banks and insurers must be able to act by common accord in this area, and I think that the establishment of a joint committee is a good idea.</p>
      <p sl="it">The scope of this directive needs to be clearly identified at European level in order to avoid misunderstanding and potential conflicts that would weaken the role of prevention and supervision in the sector. The increasingly close interdependence that has emerged in the financial sector certainly needs new, more effective and extensive rules that can be applied to the entire European dimension.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too wish to begin by congratulating my colleague Mr Stolojan. This proposal for a directive is part of the changes associated with the supplementary supervision that is taking place, aimed at streamlining risk management practices.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The need to review the framework supporting the supplementary supervision of financial entities in a financial conglomerate has been dictated by globalisation, which has had an impact on Europe’s financial market. The financial crisis has spotlighted major shortcomings in the financial sector in terms of supervision. I should mention that the aim of reviewing this framework is to supervise the operation of Europe’s biggest financial groups. Some financial groups cannot be subject to supplementary supervision because of their legal structure. At the same time, it is sometimes difficult to keep banking activities separate from insurance activities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I should emphasise that it is of paramount importance for financial groups to be subject to an identical, harmonised supervision procedure, which would strengthen Europe’s supervisory mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the report by Mr Stolojan is an excellent piece of work and underlines an urgent issue. We can say, based on the problems and as a result of the globalised and integrated status of the financial sector, that the previously applied monitoring methods and procedures have to be synchronised with the risks arising in the complex and extended financial conglomerates. I agree that the extensive contamination of financial conglomerates and the errors in the system will affect the situation of the financial sector in the long term as well. I absolutely support the amendment of the directive in order to restore trust, and I support the idea to prepare guidelines for transparency. The proposed stress tests will highlight the weaknesses of the system, and this is why I believe that the exposure to risks will definitely decrease in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, supplementary supervision of a financial conglomerate should lead to a reduction in the systemic risk that such conglomerates pose to the market. Supervision at group level will be added and will not replace the supervision of each member of the conglomerate under the applicable arrangements for supervision in the banking market, the capital market or the insurance market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore we will have supervision at group-member level, over which we will overlap the supervision at group level to which the member belongs. This supplementary supervision will not produce extra bureaucracy as long as there is cooperation between the European and national authorities with regulatory responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am grateful to everyone who spoke in support of Mr Stolojan’s position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to make a few comments and clarifications. Firstly, I should like to thank Mr Skinner for his very competent treatment of these issues. Like you, Mr Skinner, I believe that this text will do much to enhance supervision at a global and consolidated level. Like you, I believe that this is part of the G20 programme that I have often mentioned here before you – Mrs Băsescu referred to it a moment ago. No operator, sector or product should escape effective regulation and intelligent supervision. Mr Siekierski, just now, also raised this point concerning global supervision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Skinner, regarding our discussions with the United States, I have told you how much time I am spending on this issue; we are making progress point by point, and we are doing so with a great deal of confidence but without being naive. The text on derivatives that we discussed earlier with Mr Langen was the subject of many technical discussions with the US regulators throughout summer 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of our discussions with the United States, firstly on the substance, Mr Skinner, I can assure you that these discussions are extremely rich and intense and that no stone has been left unturned. When I met the US authorities and the US minister, I made clear reference to this particular point on conglomerates by explaining that we were going to look in depth at this issue, which is specific to Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These issues, Mr Skinner, are formally dealt with in the Basel Committee’s Joint Forum, not in the context of the transatlantic dialogue, and that makes a certain amount of sense, in practice, as financial conglomerates are global players. Here too, we are monitoring this work very closely. Mrs Bowles mentioned the result – a positive one, thanks to you – achieved with regard to correlation tables and their inclusion in the text, as we had requested.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to voice my agreement with Mr Giegold on the need for consolidated global supervision. This issue of the Joint Committee, which Mr Morganti too raised, is important. I should also like to tell him that we have together scheduled a review for 2012, and even for 2013; we will do everything we can. Mr Giegold, these amendments that you are going to adopt are only the first stage. We must continue to strengthen the legislative framework for conglomerates, particularly in the text of the supervision package, and the role of the Joint Committee, and this in the light of the lessons that we could learn, in a few years’ time, from the application of the Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD 4) and the Solvency II package.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, on this very important issue, which is specific to Europe but which affects powerful businesses, I am happy to continue our dialogue on strengthening the supervision of these conglomerates in other debates, as I just said, in 2012 and 2013, and like Mrs Bowles, I hope that we can do so as boldly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I thank all the speakers who raised several issues in this debate, some of which we had a long discussion on during the trialogue meetings. My colleagues proposed some issues as amendments, and the main obstacle we had in agreeing on these issues was the lack of impact assessments. We should not forget that we are discussing the financial sector, which is very sensitive to all kinds of regulation, and each regulation has a cost. Therefore we should be very careful when we propose different regulation for entities operating in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">I very much hope that the Commission will be able – maybe next year – to come up, as they proposed, with a new proposal for a directive on supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this report concerns short selling and the supervision of credit default swaps, those products that insure debt against default, in particular state default.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The origins of this text lie in the Greek crisis, which began in spring 2010. Following certain movements on the financial markets that had been observed, a political request was put to Commissioner Barnier and to the European Commission to establish European rules on short selling and on sovereign debt speculation tools. The Commission drafted that regulation in September. This was followed by the adoption of our position in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in March, and of the Council position in May. Since then we have been negotiating, because we have already had five trialogues, which have enabled us to reach a number of possible compromises. Although they are not here, I should like to thank the representatives of the Hungarian Presidency who took part in these trialogues and helped to move this matter forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, after those four or five negotiating sessions, we and the shadow rapporteurs who voted by a majority for this text in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – in other words, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which I represent – took the decision to vote in the July part-session for this text, but not for the legislative proposal, in order to send two messages. The first message consists in saying that we want to carry on negotiating with the Council because it has been almost a year since the Commission tabled this text and because, on this issue as on others, Parliament wishes to adopt a responsible yet ambitious attitude. We want these texts; we want the rules on financial markets to change. Too often, we have to wait for the Council, which clearly takes much longer to make its decisions than we do. Therefore, we want to carry on negotiating, which means that we will not be voting for the legislative proposal tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we also want to send three messages on the substance in order to reaffirm the positions adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which will become the positions of the European Parliament too when it adopts them – by a very large majority, I think – tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first issue concerns the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). In our version we have strengthened the role of ESMA, and you have reminded us many times, Commissioner, of the importance of that institution when it comes to ensuring the consistency of the single-market rules on financial services. I have to say that the position adopted in the Council – to have a red line that is an absolute red line for us, to create a right of veto for States on European regulatory issues concerning sovereign debt – is completely unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point that I wished to raise is that we in Parliament want a simple rule: when you sell an asset, be it a share or a bond, you must be able to know for certain where to find it; there must be an agreement with the person who is going to lend it to you. This is what is known as the ‘hard locate’ rule in technical speak. This is Parliament’s position, and I think it is a sensible one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The final point that I should like to emphasise, and which is obviously a key element of the discussions we are having, is the ban on naked credit default swaps. This position is shared by a large majority of the European Parliament. We do not see how it is possible, in financial terms, to cover oneself against a risk with a credit default swap without being liable for that risk, in other words without owning the bond of the country that issued the security. It is a nonsense and it opens the door to speculation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I would say that the current debates on Greece prove us right, because some of the arguments made to limit the Greek restructuring consist in saying, ‘Yes, but some people have speculated. If the debt is restructured, they are going to make money without having invested in Greece.’ That is exactly what we want to put a stop to.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as Mr Canfin said, with each day that passes, if we look closely at what is happening on the markets, we are reminded of the urgent and topical nature of this text. That is why, Mr Canfin, my entire Directorate-General and my team have worked so quickly, I think, and so seriously in four and a half months; on 15 September it will be a year since we tabled this text. I see the time passing, we know that times passes much more quickly in the world of the markets than in the world of democracy, and that is why I hope, like you, that you will be able to follow up the good work that you have done with the Hungarian Presidency recently in order to find a solution and to reach some compromises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, the 2008 financial crisis and the stock-market collapse that followed clearly illustrated the consequences and the risks that can result from uncontrolled movements on the financial markets, which are sometimes encouraged by a number of reprehensible practices that we must regulate. The 2009 bond crisis highlighted the fact that these phenomena can affect bond markets too by causing serious problems for everyone operating on them, including Member States when they try to raise capital.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In both cases, the Member States reacted urgently, and often in a disorderly fashion, without having the information and the resources necessary to act effectively and within a genuinely European framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The draft regulation on short selling and credit default swaps (CDS) is specifically aimed at remedying this situation. We want to make these practices more transparent. Although they are often useful, they can have an impact on the markets by increasing volatility. The regulation must enable national regulators to act effectively, within the comprehensive and coordinated European framework that we want to consolidate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Faced with markets that are still unstable and with the persistent problems concerning the debt of certain Member States, Europe must take swift action, and it must take practical action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is vital that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission can make progress on reaching a dynamic compromise, something which you yourself want, Mr Canfin, and the few weeks that you are going to have should make this possible. I am very grateful to you, Mr Canfin, for the very effective work you have done alongside and with the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Ferber, Mr Goebbels, Mr Schmidt and Mr Kamall, and the Presidency, which has supported these efforts, as you said yourself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The text put to the vote in Parliament and the general Council agreement are aligned on many points now. I think that the trialogues have made this alignment process possible, and I hope that it will succeed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to raise three points in your presence: the purchase of naked CDSs, the restrictions on naked short selling, and the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which you yourself mentioned, Mr Canfin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Point one: regarding the sensitive issue of CDSs on sovereign risks and the possibility of buying them without being exposed to the underlying risk, therefore naked, I believe that appropriate action should be taken. I have reservations, as you know, about the effects of an unconditional ban on naked CDSs where the liquidity of sovereign markets is concerned and about the impact that that might have on the bond market. I think that we need to change the status quo and not leave it up to the Member States to decide whether or not to ban naked CDSs. We must not let this opportunity slip; that is why I can confirm to you that we are willing to work with the European Parliament and with the Council in order to come up with a solution that responds to these concerns, which are in fact legitimate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Point two: regarding the restrictions on short selling and the ‘locate rule’, which you mentioned, we must maintain effective and sufficiently binding measures for market operators. Having different provisions for shares and sovereign debt may be an option, Mr Canfin, but this must not result in requirements that are too flexible and hence ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Point three: regarding ESMA’s powers, it is very important for that authority – I shall say it again in relation to this text – to be able to carry out its coordination and, in some cases, intervention role; this was a requirement laid down in ESMA’s founding regulation, which you yourselves consolidated, and this regulation officially authorises such intervention under certain circumstances. The issues relating to sovereign debt are, of course, particularly important for the Member States. We can see this very clearly at the present time, but maintaining a European regulatory framework that dovetails with an authority that can act effectively is also very important. I made a promise, during the recent ECOFIN Council in May, to work with you and with the Council on an appropriate solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I am very grateful to you for having properly understood and worked on this text, which I consider to be one of the bricks that we talked about earlier, and for having decided to take the few days or weeks necessary to work effectively on the trialogues and to bring them to a successful conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a very important proposal and a very important report. In my view, the very fact that we are having this debate demonstrates that in the past we allowed things to go on in the financial markets that had, in fact, been banned in casinos and state lotteries for years or even decades.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur has rightly pointed out that, in the current situation, credit default swaps (CDSs) are being offered which insure something that may not even exist. In practice, the result – and this is also true in the current debate on the crisis in Greece – is that nobody knows how many CDSs actually exist, or what the consequences would be in the event that Greece should actually declare itself bankrupt. It is high time that we regulated this and ensured proper supervision. In so doing we can help draw up rules for the financial markets that are at least equal to those that apply when ordinary citizens visit a casino or play the lottery.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is right for us to debate this important proposal from the Commission here in plenary today and for us to lay down our position as the European Parliament tomorrow, because discussions in recent weeks – with all respect to the Hungarian Presidency, which has tried very hard to bring the Council and Parliament closer together on this – have shown that the Council of Ministers still needs to be motivated into adopting rules that allow what is necessary, but which prohibit what is not necessary.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me say quite plainly that I can hardly stand to hear the word liquidity any more. If there was one problem that was to blame for leading us into the financial crisis, it was that there was too much liquidity that was invested in products that nobody needs and which then collapsed and took us into the crisis. I ask you therefore: who is it that needs insurance against a government defaulting on its commitments? Only those that hold such government securities, and they should indeed have it. Anyone speculating on a country being unable to meet its commitments, however, should not be able to use such instruments to do so. That is why these products must be prohibited.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the short selling of shares – in other words, selling shares that one does not have – it is a matter of drawing up rules that prevent highly speculative behaviour. I believe we have achieved a reasonable compromise here, and in this respect discussions with the Council have been very constructive. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive discussions, and also the Commission, which has played a very positive part in achieving this. Moreover, I hope that, for its part, the Council – which is unfortunately not represented here today – will be able to agree a sensible resolution of this matter with us as soon as possible. With that in mind, I am pleased that we – as Parliament – are now sending out a clear signal as regards this important dossier.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I fully agree with my fellow Members Mr Canfin, Mr Lehne and Mr Ferber, because I believe that in order to prevent a new financial crisis, we need to strengthen market regulation. In particular, we need to ban all abusive practices, one particularly harmful example of which is short selling. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were forced into bankruptcy by the short selling of the shares of those two paragons of Wall Street capitalism. Naked credit default swaps (CDSs) are more abusive still. Warren Buffett described them as weapons of mass destruction. In theory, a CDS is a guarantee against a possible loss on a security. Yet naked CDSs offer the possibility of insuring oneself against a risk for which one is not liable. That is toxic speculation and it endangers the real economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, certain market operators are betting on the collapse of the euro area and on the default of a State. By purchasing naked CDSs on the sovereign debt of certain States, they are simply increasing the speculative pressure on the States concerned. It is strange that certain States – the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Romania and others – do not want naked CDSs on sovereign debt to be banned. They believe in the warnings from the markets predicting increased volatility on the sovereign debt market if naked CDSs are banned. Those governments should explain to their citizens that they prefer to give in to wild speculation rather than alienate the sacrosanct financial markets. Wolfgang Münchau, an editorial writer on the Financial Times , who is far from left-wing, writes the following:</p>
      <p sl="fr">I quote in English: ‘A naked CDS purchase means that you take out insurance on bonds without actually owning them. It is a purely speculative gamble. There is not one social or economic benefit. Even hardened speculators agree on this point. Especially because naked CDSs constitute a large part of all CDS transactions, the case for banning them is about as a strong as that for banning bank robberies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">‘Economically, CDSs are insurance … A universally accepted aspect of insurance regulation is that you can only insure what you actually own. Insurance is not meant as a gamble, but an instrument to allow the buyer to reduce incalculable risks. Not even the most libertarian extremist would accept that you could take out insurance on your neighbour’s house or the life of your boss.’</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore it is absolutely necessary that we reach an agreement with the Council, especially on banning naked CDSs.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Canfin, for a splendid piece of work and, above all, for the way in which he led the trialogue negotiations. It was an absolute pleasure, even if we did not entirely agree.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We need a European legislative framework for short selling. I believe that that is something on which we all agree. We need more transparency and openness. It must no longer be possible for anything to be conducted in secrecy. We need a greater ability to regulate and we also need a greater ability to regulate at European level through the agency of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). However – and I realise that I am saying something that will not go down well in this Chamber – it is important for the financial markets to have the option of short selling. That will actually provide liquidity on the market and reveal prices that have been incorrectly set as well as any share bubbles.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The controversial question is now whether the EU should introduce a ban on short selling of naked credit default swaps. In connection with the crisis in Greece, it has been claimed that market participants have used these credit default swaps to a considerable extent to speculate against the Greek crisis. The Commission’s report issued last year demonstrated that this was not the case. It simply did not happen. Neither is there any evidence, Mr Ferber, to suggest that the German ban during the financial crisis had the desired effect. On the contrary, academic experts believe that it had a negative effect. Our basic approach should be not to introduce market restrictions if we do not know what will happen.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My view and that of my group – and it is in line with what Mr Lehne and the Commissioner said – is that to experiment with a ban at the present time could be detrimental. The burden of proof should be on those who intend to introduce this ban. My group and I are in favour of the regulators being able, in exceptional circumstances, to introduce a temporary ban or to restrict short selling if manipulation of the market or other phenomena occur. However, a permanent ban at this present time would make the market, which is already experiencing uncertainty, even more uncertain.</p>

Mr Giegold, I tried to explain that in Swedish and I think the burden of proof is upon you to say why you should ban naked CDSs today, because exactly as the Commissioner said, there is turmoil out there in the market. We do not know what is going to happen – that is also what Mr Lehne said. This is the crucial issue now: you do not know what is going to happen, I do not know what is going to happen, therefore be cautious, my dear friend Sven Giegold, be cautious.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the work that we have done, even though we may not agree on every element.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things that we do agree on is the need for better coordination between regulators and supervisors across borders so that they can act quickly. We all agree on the need for greater transparency. We can also agree that, where there is abusive behaviour in short selling, that should be banned. But that is banned under the Market Abuse Directive, so we have to be clear about what we are trying to achieve with this directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question has been raised about uncovered sovereign CDSs. When I talk to the participants in the market I ask them why they want to use uncovered sovereign CDSs. Some of the investment banks tell me that they need them if they provide credit lines to some small and second-tier banks. I have also heard from investors – and I have shared this with my colleagues, but they did not seem to want to listen – that, if you have investments in countries that you are concerned about and you cannot get protection on those investments, you use uncovered sovereign CDSs as a proxy hedge for those investments, in such sectors as infrastructure, shopping malls and others. That is why they are used.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem is that, if we ban this, what will we end up with? We will end up with more complicated and less transparent instruments, when we want transparency. We will also end up not actually recognising the real problem. The real problem with CDSs and other derivatives is how they are treated on the balance sheets of banks and how banks use them to falsify their accounts, liquidity and capital.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us focus on the real problem here, rather than trying to ban everything without tackling the real problem. Let us tackle the real problem of transparency, IFRS standards and the way these instruments are dealt with by banks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speculation was a major factor in triggering the crisis, while credit default swaps (CDSs) and short selling have been a major factor in heightening the crisis. These instruments have degenerated into purely speculative instruments. Some people in the financial sector seem to have incorrectly regarded or misused these instruments as a personal licence to print money. As a result, entire economies have suffered, along with nation states and, above all, the people of the countries concerned. To this extent, the fact that the Commission has finally taken the initiative and realised that regulation is necessary is to be welcomed. Whether or not the regulation will be strict remains to be seen.</p>
      <p sl="de">I expressly welcome the work and the efforts by the rapporteur, Mr Canfin, to improve the regulation tabled and to put a stop to the gambling. What is needed is a de facto ban on naked short selling and the prevention of speculation in the future. We also need strict regulation and, above all, a strong supervisory authority in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I fear, however, that as the negotiations continue, the interests of the financial centres – London and Frankfurt in particular – will override the interests of the majority of the people of Europe. If that happens we will be left with little more than a Swiss cheese in which the holes are probably larger than what is left. That is quite definitely not something my group could support.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, thank you, Mr Obermayr. I think that the answer to your question is very simple. When we see the Council dragging its feet and doing nothing for more than a year, I cannot understand the Commission’s position. Why should Member States be banned from taking measures themselves? When one State is under threat, it cannot expect the Council made up of all the States to be on hand to make a decision, assuming that it does not want to. This is why I think that Member States must be given the power to ban these instruments in this situation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">As far as the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is concerned, I agree that it is exceptionally important. However, as I said at the start of my speech, I cannot simply imagine how staff, who should exercise real control, will be recruited for this agency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. Let me make a few comments based on the debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Some of you may think this is trivial, but I would like to remind you that falls on the stock markets during the crisis were a consequence and not a cause of the problems. The reasons for these dramatic falls were the excessive risks taken by market participants, and the falls were a reaction to the losses they incurred. Sometimes, after all, prices have to fall to reflect the true value of a share or bond or other instrument. What is important is that these falls do not lead to panic or excessive hesitation. This is why the regulation is so important. In my view it addresses the challenge, and this is why I am pleased, as a situation where a supervisory agency is in possession of the full facts on short selling is an eminently desirable situation. It will increase the quality of supervision and confidence in this type of institution. However, I am not fully convinced whether making this information public will also contribute to this. I hope that it does not have consequences which are very different from those expected, such as the knowledge that a certain amount of short selling is taking place which may lead investors to tend to pursue that very trend.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Regarding credit default swaps (CDSs), I am not convinced that banning uncovered CDS transactions is a proper reaction to what has happened to Greek bonds. There is no convincing proof, or at least I am not aware of any, that CDSs caused greater hesitation or increased interest rates on bonds of endangered countries. Please remember that the markets for CDS contracts are many times smaller than the bond markets of countries on which they are based. This is why it is difficult to believe that this issue has had such an effect. Even in spite of that I could agree that the ban is justified, were it not for the fact that – as Mr Kamall mentioned, among others – empty CDSs in fact cover other transactions which have not been included.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we do not know precisely what role short selling or naked short selling played in the bankruptcies of Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers, but we do know that they made at least a substantial contribution to the collapse of these institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Claiming that naked short selling is useful for the market is as hard to prove as saying that it will be the end of the world if we do not prohibit it. We are dealing here with a highly complex, extremely technical area and I would not dare to claim that one thing or another was definitely right. However, it seems to me absurd to want to sell something that you do not even have, and moreover to want to do this on a speculative basis. It goes against my basic understanding of how one should behave in business. If I do not have the title to something then it is difficult for me to offer it for sale. Whether this is genuinely useful for the market is something that I am not in a position to judge. Perhaps it is – but my instinct suggests it is not.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore suggest that we should deal with it by saying that shares, debt instruments and credit default swaps (CDSs) can only be offered for sale if you either hold the title or – if you do not hold the title – a loan agreement has been concluded or at least an agreement that says that the title will be available the next day or in a certain number of days’ time if the transaction is actually concluded and settled, so that no risk arises. I thought that the Council and Parliament had already agreed on this when they agreed the intraday rule. I regret to say that the Council has since moved away from this position, and I hope that it may find its way back to it.</p>
      <p sl="de">One thing is certain: in the final event, these are international transactions and it is therefore important for us to have very clear supervisory rules. It seems to me that the recently established European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is the ideal institution to have a sole mandate to intervene in serious cases and to establish what needs to be prohibited, what needs at least to be recorded, where we need a repository, where we need a reporting requirement and so on. In this respect we have an ideal opportunity to use ESMA productively.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I too must welcome the Commission’s initiative on creating a legal framework for short selling and credit default swaps (CDSs) regarding the situations where market operations would pose a threat to financial stability or market confidence. I agree with the proposal to introduce a transparency system which entails the relevant authorities being notified of significant net short positions in shares, according to specific thresholds. In normal circumstances, short selling is conducive to market liquidity and helps set prices effectively. However, when the markets are experiencing difficulties, this operation can exacerbate the fall in prices. This situation would result in turbulent markets and systemic risks.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Regulatory bodies must be given clear-cut powers to restrict or ban short selling in exceptional circumstances. They will be exercised in cooperation with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, much like today’s debate on derivatives, this debate on short selling and credit default swaps is important if we are to maintain already fragile financial stability. The fact that these provisions take the form of a regulation is unavoidable, as they impose direct obligations on private parties to disclose information. Transparency is particularly important for financial market stability and investor protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another significant point in this proposal is the suggested ban on naked short selling. The current debt crisis has shown how speculators who choose to gamble on the bonds of eurozone Member States rather than actually own them are capable of bringing entire countries to their knees, so it is vital to restrict the practice of using credit defaults swaps as cover for securities solely to the bond holders.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The final important point promoted by the text before us is the strengthening of ESMA’s powers. I hope that the Council will review its position that decision-making in exceptional situations should be placed in the hands of finance ministers rather than ESMA, and that ESMA will take precedence in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to add a few critical remarks. In short selling one is selling a security that one does not have, or that one has merely borrowed. This enables speculators to bet on falling prices. These complex, opaque instruments were the deciding factor in bringing about the financial crisis. We therefore need a basic ban on speculative short selling of forward contracts. However, this ban needs to be comprehensive and must also include naked credit default swaps (CDSs) and short selling, particularly of government bonds. Betting on states being unable to meet their commitments in times of crisis is abominable, and we need to stem the tide of destructive speculation involving government bonds. Finally, we also need to bolster our mechanisms for sanctions in the financial services sector. The crisis involving the euro should have shown us one thing at least: not every financial transaction that is profitable in the short term is economically and ethically justifiable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I believe that we should try today to apply some common sense to this complex financial legislation, so that the human spirit is back at the heart of this work, instead of computer programs that are all configured in the same way to ensure that, when ridiculous transactions take place, no one really understands what is going on.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mrs Regner, I have not forgotten the promise that was made during the debate – which Mr Gauzès and all of you here remember – on the Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is precisely for that reason that, as I said earlier in response to the work done by Mr Canfin – which many of you unanimously praised, and rightly so – the Commission honoured its commitment by preparing, in the space of four and a half months, the text that it presented almost a year ago – it will be a year to the day on 15 September – to the bodies in charge of making a decision: Parliament, which you represent and comprise, and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to thank Mr Lehne, Mr Schmidt, Mr Händel and Mrs Flašíková Beňová for agreeing that we need to regulate credit default swaps (CDSs) and to increase transparency and financial stability. Mr Gauzès spoke about the citizens. The citizens are also taxpayers. As I have often said, they cannot afford a second crisis and, politically speaking, they will not accept another crisis without lessons being learnt from the current one, which has been going on now for more than three years and is still not over. We owe it to the citizens, particularly to those who live in countries that are being attacked on the markets, Mr Gauzès, and which are suffering under the effects of volatility, speculation and hyper-speculation, which Mr Stoyanov was not the only one to denounce here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the Commission has proposed rules, transparency and accountability, but needless to say it is willing to carry on and accomplish even more work with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Ferber, to whom I listened, as always, very carefully, raised the issue of liquidity. Let me say it again: I want to be cautious and realistic with you. Mr Schmidt also raised this point, as did Mrs Bǎsescu. We know what an important role liquidity plays in ensuring the smooth functioning of the debt market. That is why I expressed reservations about a straightforward ban. However, I am always willing to discuss progress of any kind, and any additional rules that could provide peace of mind, Mr Ferber.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Goebbels was right in saying that short selling can be harmful. However, it can also be useful, which is why we did not hesitate to implement a framework and rules. I agree with you, Mr Goebbels, holding CDSs without being exposed to the underlying risks does present problems, and sensitive ones at that. Mr Kamall also mentioned the sensitive nature of this issue. This is one of the issues that we will have to address in the trialogue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All in all, though, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to you and with you, we are going to create for the first time, if you and the Council so wish, a European framework on the CDS market, with a European authority which I hope will not be undermined, on this or any other issue, and I am keen for it to be able to use ESMA’s Article 9 – which Mr Giegold knows well – which gives it important powers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A word about naked short selling, which concerns me just as much as it concerns you. Mr Klinz and Mrs Regner raised this point. In this text we are going to propose – and I hope we can see it through – two types of regulation, everyday regulation in the shape of the ‘locate rule’, which your rapporteur, Mr Canfin, mentioned, and then a coherent liability system with a buy-back obligation. We will therefore have binding everyday rules for everyone and then the ability to enforce a coordinated ban, which we all wanted, in the event of an emergency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One final word, Mr Nitras, on the disclosure of information. We have made provision to disclose information on shares above a certain threshold. Moreover, if I am not mistaken, that is precisely what the regulators wanted and requested. In the case of sovereign debt, this disclosure will not be automatic, but it will be compulsory to provide information to those regulators who need it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I am able to say, Mr President, by way of thanks to the rapporteur and to the speakers, and to clarify a number of points before you – we – spend the next few weeks, I hope, reaching a dynamic agreement on this point.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I just wanted to say something to my fellow Member, Mr Kamall − since he is one of the negotiators of this text and is very familiar with it, and if he is not, he only has to read it – concerning his argument that credit default swaps (CDSs) are used as proxy hedges and therefore should not be banned. As the text says, when CDSs are used for proxy hedging, they are not uncovered. It would be helpful, therefore, if you could change your argument or read the text, because we are debating for nothing otherwise.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">The second point that I wished to make is that we really want to complete this text because we feel that the situation is urgent. No one is saying that CDSs caused the Greek crisis. It would be absurd to think that. However, they are clearly being used to fan the flames by financial operators whose sole aim is to exacerbate the crisis so that they can make money at some point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While we are on the subject of CDSs, I should like to tell you that this text only covers the purchase of these swaps. This presents another problem, which was also raised by Mr Kamall, concerning the fact that operators who sell CDSs, such as US banks and hedge funds, are supposed to provide a guarantee against the risk of default to banks such as BNP, Deutsche Bank and Barclays. For those banks, it is a way of getting the risk off their balance sheets. However, those who sell CDSs, such as hedge funds, have a lot less capital than the banks. This tool has the effect of reducing capital requirements and hence the security of the system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since you are working on the Capital Requirements Directive 4, I should like it if you could also cover the sale of CDSs and the obligations incumbent on sellers of CDSs, rather than just focusing on buyers, as is the case in this text.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Unlike long selling, where the risk is reduced to the difference in price between buying and reselling, the risk with short selling is unlimited, which means, in theory, that losses could be limitless. Taking into account the unlimited risks which a seller also assumes in short selling, it was considered necessary to adopt this regulation. However, certain notification periods or procedures may have slightly more relaxed deadlines. Furthermore, speculative transactions, along with hedging transactions, are an integral part of this market and must be declared to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Speculative transactions are not damaging in themselves; the danger lies in them getting out of control.</p>

      <p sl="en">Restrictions on short selling and credit default swaps in exceptional situations have long been overdue, as is the need for more transparency from financial markets. Parliament rightly found it appropriate to have a common framework rather than to rely on a number of divergent measures by Member States, as experienced during the financial crisis three years ago. These obligations come in the wake of various other reforms to past regulatory regimes. It is easy to jump on the bandwagon at this time and argue that more regulation is better because we do not want to live through another crisis in our lifetime. But at the same time we all want to look forward to a future where industry, both manufacturing and services, provides much-needed jobs, based on strong economic growth. For this we need many bankable projects. Let us therefore satisfy ourselves that there is no unintended collateral damage to industry from financial regulation. We do not want EU project funding to be curtailed by a drought of liquidity, nor do we want their responsibility in mitigating risks to become prohibitively expensive so as to make them lose their competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Madam President, in this case I urgently need a broad consensus, so I will take another tone in this debate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission, the committee and the group secretariat for their excellent work. We had hoped to achieve our objective, but we are not quite there yet. Investor protection is a form of consumer protection for securities and money that banks and investment firms handle on their customers’ behalf. It enables the customer to receive compensation by the State if an institution that goes bankrupt cannot release the customer’s assets as a result of fraud or negligence or of serious erroneous assessments and mistakes. However, compensation is not provided for risk investments, for example if investments in shares fall in value.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will go through the committee’s amendments point by point. Firstly, the committee wishes to increase the level of compensation to EUR 100 000 per investor and it wants the level of compensation to be the same for all EU Member States. The most compelling reason for proposing a level of EUR 100 000 is that there are countries with levels of compensation higher than the proposed EUR 50 000, including the United Kingdom, France and Spain. Thus, we do not wish to reduce the level of compensation and thereby worsen consumer protection in these countries. The level of protection should also be as high for investments as it is for bank account savings. We need people who want to invest in the enterprise of the future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, the committee wants to extend protection to include cases where it has been proven in a court of law that an investment firm has given bad advice. It should be possible for a situation where investment firms mislead investors and give bad advice in investment decisions to constitute grounds for compensation. An example of this is if a fund advisor were to advise elderly people to invest in high-risk funds with a long investment horizon.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Thirdly, the committee considers it important to create schemes that have sufficient funds to be able to pay out the compensation. Taxpayers must not subsequently have to pick up the bill. Therefore, we should introduce ex ante funding so that there is money in the funds if a firm should go bankrupt. It is proposed that the target fund level be reduced from 0.5 to 0.3% of the investment firm’s assets. The process is being accelerated so that all Member States are to achieve full financing of their funds in five years instead of 10 years. The calculation of the fees is to be based on the potential compensation risk incurred by a firm. Those investment firms that take the biggest risks will also have to contribute more to the funds than those firms that take smaller risks.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Fourthly, the borrowing mechanism must be adjusted. The Commission has proposed a compulsory borrowing mechanism in which schemes can borrow from one another, between countries. In order to avoid moral hazard, in other words deliberate underfunding, we propose that the compulsory borrowing mechanism not be launched until all the schemes have built up their funds and reached the target level. After a five-year period, a scheme is to have the right to borrow from other schemes within the European Union, provided that the scheme that finds itself in this situation has previously achieved the target funding level.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Fifthly, the committee would like the Commission to investigate the UCITS funds, including in the directive. We have had an intense debate in committee about whether mutual and bond funds – UCITS funds – should be included or not. We believe that we need to look more closely at how this is to be done. We obviously do not want Madoff-style dealings, but the committee thinks that the Commission should investigate the advantages and disadvantages of supplementing or replacing existing schemes with insurance-based solutions, in other words a system of insurance contracts.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, the committee would also like to increase transparency by introducing a reporting obligation for the Member States of the European Union, in other words a duty to report to the Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority on how the national schemes are working.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The issue of investor protection is important for consumers and investors and for financial stability. Tomorrow, I need a strong message from Parliament. I hope that I will receive support in the vote so that we can begin negotiations with the Council as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="1-097-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would firstly like to extend warm thanks to Mr Schmidt, and also to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and its Chair Sharon Bowles, for the very ambitious and, may I say Mr Schmidt, very clear signal being sent out in regard to this important piece of work by Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Strengthening investor-compensation schemes is just one of the components of a consistent package which – may I remind you – also includes Deposit Guarantees and the White Paper on Insurance Guarantee Schemes. This comprehensive package was adopted by the Commission a year ago now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What we have here today is an important proposal in terms of our response to the crisis. Consumers, or retail investors, are some of the financial system’s most vulnerable stakeholders and they are also the main victims of the crisis. Not only is it fair to protect them, it is also logical. Moreover, our fellow citizens would not understand if we failed to protect them. A trouble-free investment requires the guarantee of being properly compensated in extreme circumstances, such as fraud or operational mistakes leading to the loss of securities. Compensating investors therefore helps to restore confidence in the financial system – that is one of the lessons of the crisis – and also to establish a genuine internal market for financial services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is the rationale which led the co-legislators to adopt the very first directive on investor compensation, on the basis of a 1997 Commission proposal. This 1997 directive has been helpful, but it needs improving; that is what we are doing here together today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, I have for a very long time now been in favour of what we call in French a ‘providential’ policy, that is to say a preventive policy; prevention always costs less than repair, and I have, in my own country, devised preventive mechanisms in other fields such as ecology. That is why I would like to see this guarantee scheme mechanism implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, Mr Schmidt, I share the ambitious approach outlined in your report. Parliament’s agreement on the pre-funding principle is a very positive point. As far as we in the Commission are concerned, pre-funding is a prerequisite for a credible system. Indeed, what is the point of planning a high level of cover if there is not enough money available for it? To say that we could raise the money on an ad hoc basis is rather unrealistic in these times of tension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, Mr Schmidt, I am also well disposed to bringing the level of cover on Deposit Guarantees into line at EUR 100 000, as you proposed. We in the Commission proposed EUR 50 000, that is to say a lower level than Deposit Guarantees in the banking sector, because we feel that the risks to financial stability are greater in this latter sector than in the investment sector. The bank run phenomenon that we experienced with Northern Rock, in 2008, particularly comes to mind. I am, however, willing to consider your proposal, which is more ambitious.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I welcome the fact that Parliament is maintaining the mutual lending mechanism between schemes. I see this as a further demonstration of your commitment to developing a more harmonised and a more shared approach, which is crucial to overcoming the challenges of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are, of course, several points, here and there, which are subjects for debate or which diverge from the Commission’s initial proposal. I believe, for example – as you pointed out in your speech – that extending the cover to UCITS, considering how attractive this product is to retail investors, is a natural step. You have called for this measure to be postponed. That said, I have taken good note of your wish for it to be re-examined under the revision of the UCITS Directive in a few months’ time. You can count on the Commission to concur with that, Mr Schmidt.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the proposed reduction in pre-funding to 0.3% should be carefully assessed if you genuinely want to increase cover to EUR 100 000. Honourable Members, there is no secret here, increasing cover while also reducing funding could, potentially, bring the system into difficulty or under stress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I have several reservations as regards introducing an amendment aimed at covering what is known as ‘bad advice’. I share your objective: finance is a complex discipline and there are a number of charlatans who readily deceive the least informed consumers. However, this situation comes under the rules of conduct of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the breach of which opens up the right to take liability action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, providing cover for ‘bad advice’ would be difficult to implement. It could lead to a considerable increase in the number of situations in which we would be driven to activate compensation funds without funding being revised accordingly. Therefore, Mr Schmidt, quite frankly, as it stands, this ‘bad advice’ concept is rather dubious in our view, and could lead to significant differences in interpretation, from one country to another, and to renewed market fragmentation. That is why we find it difficult to accept the inclusion of this concept in the text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, overall, Mr Schmidt, as well as generally renewing my thanks for the excellent work which has been done by yourself, the shadow rapporteurs and the coordinators, I can say – and this is the important point in my view – that Parliament and the Commission clearly share a common vision on this issue. This is an ambitious solution and a Europe-wide solution, and the Council should take that into account. That is the signal you are sending out to Member States, so that they can approve an overall approach quickly. I am also counting on the Polish Presidency to do all it can and to convince the countries that have still not done so to adopt this more Europe-wide approach, which is more favourable to retail investors. At the end of the day, any credible agreement must include a sufficiently high level of cover, a credible level of pre-funding and easy access to compensation. These are the lines along which we are working, Mr Schmidt, and I would like to thank you for that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the functioning of the investor compensation schemes has been improved and brought into line with banking scheme standards. I would like to mention that we cannot send a signal of equivalence of treatment between capital market investors and depositors in commercial banks. Although both categories have to be protected, with regard to protection for investors in securities it should be considered that the risk of the latter is taken by choice. I do not think it is a good idea to increase the threshold to EUR 100 000 because this will put too much burden on broker dealers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the introduction of the lending system between the schemes and I hope that Parliament in plenary will maintain my own amendment regarding the postponement of reaching the guarantee ceiling by Romania and Bulgaria, in order to respect the terms of the accession treaties.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of this text is clearly to protect private investors from the fraudulent or deeply flawed practices of investment firms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This text is designed to increase confidence after a crisis in which retail investors, as you said, Commissioner, were definitely the most vulnerable stakeholders and the ones who suffered the most.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is important to understand that this text provides for the payment of compensation as a last resort. It is not paid out on an ad hoc basis, but as a last resort. That is why our committee unanimously adopted this report, which seeks to fully harmonise the rules and to increase the ceiling to EUR 100 000.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the specific case of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), the Commission’s feeling was not that measures to protect investors should be overlooked, but that this very specific product, which, incidentally, has an excellent reputation, deserved its own rules to be laid down as part of the revisions of the UCITS Directive. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has asked your Commission to undertake a study to discover what the advantages and disadvantages would be of extending the scope of this Directive on compensation for private investors to include UCITS.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is now up to the Council to agree so that the text that we adopted at first reading – since we will also be voting on the legislative resolution – can quickly be applied. I repeat: for Europeans and private investors, there is also a feeling of belonging to the European Union which must take the form of equivalent protection for all.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, this review of the Directive on investor-compensation schemes follows on, unfortunately, from the crisis and also from the Madoff scandal, which hit some small investors in Europe hard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is taking place, as you said, at the same time as the review of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and the implementation of an equivalent directive in the field of insurance. This is important to us; it is also what led us to ask for the ceiling to be raised to EUR 100 000. Indeed, the original ceiling in the banking sector was EUR 25 000, and it is now being raised to EUR 100 000. Why create a gap in the field of investment at the very time when we want Europeans to be able to diversify their savings in secure conditions, including by promoting investment that will help us to finance our long-term investment needs?</p>
      <p sl="fr">You said that ‘bad advice’ is an issue that falls under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), but it was in fact the MiFID that inspired us to include it here, because we believe that, here too, we need to apply this useful concept that was included in the MiFID. Therefore, we are not contradicting you; we are asking you to draw on what is in the MiFID and to apply it to this text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the situation of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), as everyone has said, we do not want anyone who is currently in possession of UCITS to end up in a less favourable position than non-UCITS investors, when this savings product adds real value to the European financial market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to say a couple of things by way of conclusion, in order to draw your attention to the way in which this text might be applied to local authorities also – during the crisis we saw how severely they could be affected – and to ask you, as the European Parliament will do during its vote tomorrow, to examine the conditions in which an insurance system could be much more effective, efficient and, in a way, useful, when it comes to financing this ex ante fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you said that the citizens would not comprehend any failure in this area. We are counting on the strong vote of this Parliament tomorrow and on your pressure to ensure that the Council resolves this situation, because it is obvious that it does not want to progress as quickly as we would like.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Schmidt, ladies and gentlemen, may I express my thanks for your positive cooperation and also for the position that you took on this. This reform of the directive on the protection afforded to investors is necessary in order to improve consumer protection in the financial markets. We have experienced a number of major scandals. This reform is a consequence of those scandals. I would also like to thank the Commission for having tabled a strong, demanding proposal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to briefly discuss two points on which there was not a consensus. Mr Barnier, you mentioned the issue of bad advice. Ultimately we agreed that it makes sense to include this in the directive. We are not saying that the definition of bad advice and the structures for preventing bad advice belong in the directive, because naturally they belong in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID); however, if an undertaking demonstrably gives bad advice and cannot be held liable for this – perhaps because it has already gone bankrupt – then there is no financing for that at present. Until now, there has been no protection for the savers who suffer as a result. Representatives of the Commission also appeared to be very open to this in the discussions and consultations that took place in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I would therefore ask you, Mr Barnier, to now once more reconsider your position of rejecting this. We will also need to look at this matter again in the context of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives (UCITS). Thank you for being willing to accommodate this.</p>
      <p sl="de">One central issue in my view, however, is that there is currently a blocking minority in the Council. The German Government is part of this minority. It should reconsider again whether it really wants to maintain this blocking minority. We need this reform of the directive on protection for investors. After the crisis we have been through our citizens will find it incomprehensible if consumer protection remains weak.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Madoff is often cited as a reason for these sorts of measures, but actually, in the Madoff affair, the SEC in the US was warned a number of times. So arguably they had the tools at their disposal, they just chose not to use them.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I am worried about in this particular directive, though, is creating moral hazard and encouraging investors not to practise due diligence. They can invest willy-nilly knowing full well that they will be compensated for a bad decision, and that is what we have to be very careful about.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the other groups for accepting my amendment on transparency. It is important that investors see the cost of regulation, but also understand how much they are being charged for compensation so that, when they buy an investment, they are not being hoodwinked into paying more than they need to.</p>
      <p sl="en">But what I am worried about is the high level of compensation. It is fine for places like London, Frankfurt and Paris, but many of the small Member States are very worried about a harmonised level of EUR 100 000 and worry about concentration of financial services and financial products in the big centres. I welcome the fact that London is such a centre, but I am worried about that from a competitive point of view. For that reason we will be abstaining but look forward to a healthy debate in the trialogues.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as we are all aware, the financial markets and the securities traded on them are becoming increasingly complex, and thus increasingly opaque and incomprehensible to investors. The financial crisis emanating from the US made it clear that this is not just true of conventional small investors; it brought to light the fact that European banking institutions, too, were shifting vast quantities of nested securities that ultimately proved to be worthless.</p>
      <p sl="de">Alongside strict control of the financial markets – including restrictions on certain speculative practices such as naked short selling – I therefore feel it is necessary to bolster the various compensation schemes for investors. In my view, consumer protection should be a major consideration when amending this directive. The proposals drafted by the rapporteur in this respect as regards the Commission’s text are therefore to be thoroughly welcomed. Those investing internationally, in particular – and in fact, most investors are likely to be doing so – must have legal certainty and predictability in respect of any claims. That is why we need a common level of protection, as mentioned previously.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Objectively speaking, there are, Mr Bodu, differences between Deposit Guarantees on the one hand and investor compensation on the other. However, as I said earlier, if sufficient funding was available, I would be in favour of the alignment that both you and Mrs Berès mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Gauzès, I confirm that we will examine the extension of cover to include UCITS. I am aware of Parliament’s reservations on this matter. However, I believe, Mr Gauzès, that it would be useful to plan its inclusion in the scope of the directive. We will nevertheless try to convince one another mutually and debate this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also think, Mr Gauzès, that all investors should be put on an equal footing. In any case, I would like to thank you for having again highlighted the need to protect investors properly, as Mr Mölzer also reminded us in his speech a few moments ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As Mrs Berès herself said, I was pressing for the adoption of the comprehensive package to which this text belongs. Therefore, we have not yet come to the end of the road, and investors and insurance holders are both affected. I would like to point out, Mrs Berès, that the future text on central securities depositories will provide a further opportunity to learn a number of lessons from the Madoff affair.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have also taken note of two points which captured my attention and which I believe to be important, even though they involve technical aspects. The first one concerns the inclusion of insurance contracts. I think that is a good question; I am going to look into it and also study the difficulties and technical problems that it may entail. Secondly, there is an issue to which I am obviously sensitive, that is the excessive, or in some cases exorbitant, debt into which some local authorities have managed to get themselves. I will follow your debate closely on that too, and we will look at how we can deal with this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Mrs Berès, you raised the issue of ‘bad advice’, as did Mr Giegold; I think it is a legitimate issue. I too want people to be safeguarded or protected. I ask though, is this the appropriate legal instrument to achieve that? This is a technical legal issue which may lead to divergence, and that would require us, in particular, Mr Giegold, to have a consistent and harmonised definition of what should be considered as ‘bad advice’. However, I sensed your insistence. I see that there is broad agreement on this issue, and we are therefore going to look into it in light of your debate today and your objections, which I have duly noted.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, even if you have perhaps not noticed it before, I have confidence in the free market and in people’s abilities to make free choices. However, at the same time I would like to make it very clear that I also firmly believe that consumers must be protected. It is clear that, from this point of view alone, this directive is an extremely important one. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, you can criticise me in other respects, but on this matter we are in complete agreement with one another. It must be possible for the ordinary investor to know that the investments he or she makes are reasonably safe. This is extremely important for the future of Europe. That is how I see it, and how I view confidence in the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr Barnier, you talked about undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and forms of financing; 0.3% can be discussed if we also go up to EUR 100 000. I agree with that, but, at the same time, the Council’s view is that we should have a very much lower-level financing mechanism. We probably do not know exactly where we will end up. I also think that it is reasonable to include UCITS in the context of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) and also with regard to UCITS 5, but I am sure that we will be able to reach agreement on that. With regard to bad advice, I, too, hope that we can find a solution, because I believe that this is an important issue for ordinary investors in Europe at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, Mr Gauzès, Ms Berès, Mr Kamall and Mr Giegold for their very fruitful cooperation, and I hope that we can close this dossier in the autumn.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (COM(2010)0093 – C7-0046/2009 – 2009/0089(COD)) (A7-0241/2011).</p>
      <p sl="unknown">We had expected Commissioner Malmström to be with us, but I understand there is a problem with her incoming flight. She is on her way but she will not be here at the beginning. Commissioner Barnier will stand in so long as is necessary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, there are three underlying questions which I would like to highlight at the start of this debate. The first is legislative efficacy. Once more, and on subjects as sensitive as Schengen-related issues, Parliament has managed to come to an agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have worked well and quickly. For those who do not believe in codecision, we have once again given a conclusive response. If the decision were still made by unanimity in the Council, it would be adjourned for even longer. I thank the Hungarian Presidency for its efforts and competent performance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">My second point is the strengthening of Schengen. Notwithstanding the differing opinions on some issues, we have achieved broad consensus in this Parliament. This is because, essentially, we want to see Schengen strengthened and we do not condone attempts to weaken the free circulation of people. I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their collaboration and their support.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, I would highlight the EU solution. Although initially it had little support in the Council, the creation of this agency corresponds to the preference shown by this Parliament, which has always fought for a European solution to the detriment of the intergovernmental one, which is still prevalent in the First Schengen Information System (SIS I). According to the impact assessment carried out by the Commission, the creation of an agency is without doubt the best solution from an economic, operational and institutional point of view.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to ask Commissioner Barnier to pass on our thanks to Commissioner Malmström for her timely initiative and for her cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The regulation that we are going to adopt corresponds positively to the concerns of this Parliament. Allow me to emphasise seven points. Firstly, new systems clash with the legislative instrument; much is said about new systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The regulation clearly ensures that new systems can only be added after they have been created by means of a legal instrument adopted by codecision with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, interoperability between systems is rejected. It is expressly guaranteed that there can be no interoperability between the systems managed by the agency, unless this possibility is expressly established in the legal instruments which create each of these systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The third point is the location of the agency. Parliament’s prerogatives have been respected and the decision has been taken in codecision between Parliament and the Council. The headquarters are to be in Tallinn, the technical site in Strasbourg and the back-up site in Austria. Pressure from Parliament led to our receiving two letters from the French and Estonian Ministers confirming the investment that each of the two countries would make so that the solution arrived at would be the most cost-efficient.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fourthly, on communication infrastructure we managed to reach a compromise: any possibility of non-authorised access will be prohibited; all data circulating within the network has to be encrypted, and it is guaranteed that the encryption key cannot be transferred to the responsibility of a private company under an outsourcing agreement, exactly the opposite to what currently happens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have also regulated the members of the management board and voting rights in such a way as to guarantee that the Member States only participate in systems to which they are linked. The participation of the United Kingdom was safeguarded while Ireland decided not to be bound by this regulation. Finally, Madam President, diverse improvements were introduced with regard to the reinforcement of Parliament’s role, the reinforcement of transparency and the improvement of data protection.</p>

    <intervention id="1-111-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for your understanding. The arrival of Commissioner Malmström’s flight was delayed, due to circumstances beyond her control. She has asked me to apologise to you on her behalf. She is currently making her way here to join us, and I will therefore pass your message on to her, Mr Coelho.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe she will be here in few moments to take over from me; however, while we wait, I would like to extend very warm thanks, on her behalf, to Mr Coelho, for the constructive approach he showed throughout the negotiations on this proposal involving – I think I can say this – fruitful cooperation between the three institutions. I believe we have thus reached our common objective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This proposal, as you know better than anyone, is a response to the European Parliament’s and the Council’s explicit request, made in 2006, when the basic instruments for the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS) were adopted. Based on impact assessments, Eurodac is now also included in the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The main role of the future agency will be to ensure that these crucial IT systems operate properly 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that data exchange takes place in full compliance with data security and data protection regulations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the future, the purpose of the agency will be to develop other very large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, based on the legislative proposals which have been or which are due to be adopted by the co-legislator. With regard to the compromise proposal, Commissioner Malmström informed me that she was satisfied that Parliament’s main amendments had been incorporated into the compromise text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission wishes however to emphasise and clarify its intention to make a statement, to be included in the Council’s minutes, recalling that the principle of the European Union’s institutional autonomy opposes the granting of voting rights in the agency to third countries, including associated countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As a result, the Commission’s acceptance of the co-legislator’s compromise is based on the principle that this compromise does not grant voting rights to associated countries or create expectation in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Coelho, honourable Members, Madam President, that is what I wanted to say on behalf of Commissioner Malmström. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), Eurodac and other large-scale information technology systems is crucial to the future of the European area of freedom, security and justice. As a result, setting up a single authority responsible for the operational management of these IT systems is an absolute must.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are going through a time of budget constraints which must also be reflected in the European agencies’ activities. I support the proposal for the agency’s strategy to be based on a multiannual staff policy plan and a draft annual work programme, with clear objectives and performance indicators. I regret that the proposal tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control for the number of members on the management board to be reduced was not accepted. I respect the right of Member States to be involved in the decision-making process at agency level. However, I think that a management board made up of 29 members is a costly, cumbersome structure which does not help operations run more efficiently. I think that the agency’s number-one priority must be to clarify the situation with SIS II. An analysis needs to be carried out and a decision made about the programme and the costs involved in completing this system.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I support Mr Coelho’s thorough work and I congratulate him on his negotiating capacity, in Parliament and at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">In terms of the need to create a new agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems, we should remember that the Commission itself has declared that it cannot assume the responsibility for managing large databases, and that creating a merely executive agency would not in any case give Parliament control, because it would still be embedded in the structure of the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">Considering the important work being entrusted to the new agency and the need for this work to be scrutinised by Parliament, however, the new body should take the form of a European agency with its own legal status.</p>
      <p sl="es">Its objectives should be clearly defined, these being operational management of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac. It could also take responsibility for the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale information systems.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it should be noted that this must in all cases be done with the right legal instruments. The agency will not under any circumstances be able to take political decisions, such as creating new information systems or decisions on interoperability with different systems.</p>
      <p sl="es">The important role that the agency is to play means it must have a reinforced administrative structure that will ensure data integrity and protection, and for this reason it is essential that it incorporate a post of data security manager and an independent data protection body, thereby complying with the legal provisions contained in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">In conclusion, Mr Coelho, I am very much in agreement with your three initial points, and with the seven points made by Parliament on making a strong commitment to reaching an EU solution and taking a firm stand against any limitation of the Schengen Area.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I too would like to commend our fellow Member Mr Coelho for the skills which he employed during this negotiation and which have enabled the European Parliament to achieve a number of excellent results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our objective, as he said, was to improve the operational effectiveness of data security systems in the area of justice and internal affairs, for the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to underline several points which the socialists consider to be truly positive steps forward. First of all, it has been guaranteed that the agency’s remit will be limited to technical tasks which will not be allowed to exert any form of influence on the actual substance of the data held. Secondly, democratic transparency is to be employed throughout the whole process, allowing the European Parliament not only to be involved in the selection process for the agency’s director, but also, and above all, assuring us that, if the agency’s remit were to be extended to other systems and if there were an intention to make any of those systems interoperable with current systems, this could only be done through the ordinary legislative procedure. Thirdly, it is forbidden for private operators to undertake system maintenance and have access to security codes and data content and, finally, the European Parliament is participating in choosing the location for the agency’s seat.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to this final point, I would like to express my regret that in negotiating the regulations the naming of the seat was subject to such resistance from the Council. Its unilateral statement to the effect that this decision would not set a precedent has no legal value as such. Our institution adhered strictly to the Treaties, according to which Parliament must also give its consent in the naming of seats of European agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In light of this, I would like the Council to at last consider the European Parliament as a full partner, that is to say a co-legislator, in the same capacity as itself. This form of institutional rivalry is also affecting work on the Schengen issue, particularly as regards the revision of the Schengen evaluation mechanism. I would in that regard like us to move our focus to debating the real issues rather than focusing on legal battles.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Coelho is as usual a safe pair of hands – I am not sure what we would do without him – and he has safely overseen the co-legislation of this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has attempted to develop several large-scale systems over the last few years but we know, certainly in the case of SIS II, that there have been serious delays and even some apparent mismanagement. In some of our Member States it is not unknown to have these problems. So it is sensible to concentrate technical know-how in one place. But at the same time, as Mr Coelho said, it is important to ensure on sensitive issues, such as any proposal for system or data interoperability, that Parliament is very much involved in any such decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that this regulation provides for the European Data Protection Supervisor to have the power to obtain from the agency access to all information necessary to his work.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission will shortly propose setting up yet more IT systems, for instance an entry/exit system for Schengen borders and a registered traveller programme. I do not know whether the Commissioner – I know he is standing in for a colleague – is able to tell us whether the Commission is already planning that the agency should be involved in designing those two new databases.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very pleased that the UK will be able to participate in the adoption of this regulation and in the management of the agency to a degree that reflects its participation in SIS and in Eurodac. This is perhaps a model for variable geometry in the Schengen evaluation mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, Mr Coelho, right now we are debating for the last time the framework for the IT agency that is to be created for the European Union. As Parliament we will agree a compromise with the Council that incorporates our key demands. This is partly because we have already had many debates on this, but it is also partly down to the good work carried out by the rapporteur, who I would like to thank both for his work and for such good cooperation. I would like to take this opportunity to assure him of the support of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Having said that, however, I should like to emphasise one substantive point regarding the IT agency. The framework planned quite clearly excludes any integration of various databases with personal data. We want to have an efficient and secure technical platform, but we do not want this expanded to include the capture of personal data for any purpose whatsoever. Parliament’s vote should sound a note of warning to anyone who has other intentions. We are keeping an eye on this agency and will not tolerate anyone veering off on their own.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in today’s increasingly mobile world, personal data protection is an essential tool in ensuring the safety of citizens and an area of free and unrestricted movement in the European Union. Well-organised and reliable protection will increase activity, which will also contribute to economic and social development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The plan to create a supervisory agency for all three information systems currently in force appears interesting, as managing large-scale information systems requires a responsible specialist institution. However, it is important to ensure that all Member States are represented on its board. For the data protection system to be effective, individual solutions must be obligatory for all Member States. An important task that the agency must perform is to guarantee the security of the network and data transmission by eliminating the threats that are becoming increasingly widespread. According to the model of the European Data Protection Inspector, the agency should achieve its aims while respecting the fundamental rights of citizens. I hope that this system will allow data to be exchanged more effectively and processed and made available more securely.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, yet another expensive, bureaucratic monster arises by combining VIS, SIS and Eurodac, whether or not any Member State currently participates in these agencies. It is meant to develop Schengen, which itself is under pressure due to the Libyan situation. What is the use of a system to allow free movement which has to be partially suspended because of the free movement it encourages?</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand there will be a central agency to retain fingerprints and biometric records for five years, including material obtained under SIS – ‘information regarding certain categories of persons and property’. So, under the guise of facilitating the free movement of people, we have a resurrection of the Stasi.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, this is intended to lead to EU immigration control. In the case of the UK, many immigrants come from the Commonwealth, a unique voluntary association including every single one of our former colonies. Well, we have our own border controls for that purpose, and the EU does not have the right to interfere.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, in contrast to the previous speaker, I believe that it is important for us to in fact support the establishment of this agency. I have often been sceptical when it comes to establishing agencies. In this case I am happy to support it. Firstly, I know that Mr Coelho led the negotiations, so I know that the result will be positive. You can rely on that. Secondly, the European Commission’s handling of the Schengen Information System has shown that the management of major IT systems cannot be entrusted to the Commission. Thirdly, I consider it sensible that we bring the management of three major information systems – these being the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac – under one roof. This will undoubtedly have synergy benefits.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important that we state what the agency is to do and what it is not to do; namely, that it is not to make political decisions, but that it is to provide a high standard of management for these three information systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, I believe that training should be provided to ensure that the same high standards apply in all countries in respect of the implementation and use of the systems.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I should like to reiterate that I hope that this agreement on the agency will start a new debate on how the information systems can be usefully linked together – but only where there is good reason for doing so. I would point out that this would be particularly useful in a crisis situation such as we currently have in North Africa. We know that criminals are exploiting this system to cross borders and apply for asylum here, using the asylum process as a means of slipping in drugs couriers or even terrorists. Allowing Europol to use these systems would have security benefits for Europe’s citizens, and I would therefore welcome the start of a discussion along these lines.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I too would like to thank Mr Coelho, because I believe that bringing the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac together under a single EU agency is the right way to go.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The problem is, however, that some Member States are not involved in the individual systems at all, while others have only a partial involvement. In these circumstances, I would like to ask about the extent to which the regulation before us will be binding on such Member States, and about the powers they will hold in the adoption of the legislation establishing the agency.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Despite the uncertainties, I am convinced that the creation of this agency is desirable. The agency will perform important tasks and should also be responsible for technical measures of a non-legislative nature required by these tasks. These responsibilities should be without prejudice to the legislative duties exclusively within the remit of the Commission. The agency ought to be a purely operational, rather than a political, institution. Its operations and decisions must be consistent with the legal basis adopted by the European Parliament for the three different databases.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioners, first of all I would like to commend the work of our colleague Mr Coelho on this very difficult issue, for which a high level of technical expertise and a tremendous amount of work and knowledge of the issue were required.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Controlling our common territory and our European borders is one of the most significant issues we must deal with, and technology, more than ever, helps to address this challenge. Over the last few years, we have indeed witnessed an unprecedented increase in European databases and the exchange of personal data. This trend which some are describing as a digital tsunami can certainly be expected to continue in coming years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Schengen Information System (SIS), Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac are today all essential instruments in ensuring the security of European citizens. Ensuring effective operational management of these databases is therefore a key issue to which it is our responsibility to provide an effective response. This response is of course a very sensitive matter, and Mr Coelho has had to cope with many legal, institutional, budgetary, political and technical hurdles and, in spite of them all, he has managed to draft a balanced text which satisfies all of the parties concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The creation of this agency for the management of large-scale IT systems indeed seems to be the best way of ensuring Member States’ internal security. No other institution or existing agency is currently capable of ensuring that these information systems are managed properly. The agency will help to improve the management of existing information systems, provide better synergy between databases and also enable instruments adopted in the future to be integrated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where to locate the seat of the agency was one of the very delicate questions which arose on this issue. Estonia and France are the only two countries to have put themselves forward as locations for the seat. France already hosts the Schengen Information System, in Strasbourg, and has been responsible for its operational management and administration since 1995; the country thus has full technical expertise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following the conclusions of the European Council of December 2003, which gave priority to new Member States for hosting new agencies, Estonia also wanted to welcome the seat of this future agency. I believe that a very good compromise has been reached: a sort of distribution of missions – and I will conclude here Madam President – has been achieved by transferring the seat of the agency to Tallinn. Tasks relating to governance, strategy and programme design will be carried out there, while system development and operation will take place in Strasbourg. This cost-effectiveness ratio is very well balanced, and this compromise solution in no way undermines the centralised management of IT systems.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I too would like to begin by commending the exceptional efforts of Carlos Coelho who, once again, has shown the outstanding expertise he has in this area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to make two comments about setting up this new agency, which I also feel is very beneficial. First of all, in the current climate where cyber attacks have started to pose a danger of paramount global importance, we must ensure that the security of the databases administered by this agency is underpinned by the highest standards. Secondly, for the time being at least, the new agency, if it were to operate, would be unable to do part of its job as the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) is still a long way from being operational. This is why I am taking this opportunity to ask the Commission and the Commissioner to keep to their commitment to complete SIS II by the deadline.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, it makes natural sense to suggest setting up this agency as the Commission must not be responsible for managing these large-scale IT systems, precisely so that total transparency is ensured and any conflict of interest eliminated. Just think about the scope of this system comprising three parts – the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS) and Eurodac – which need a single, well-structured agency to look after them, due to their considerable importance and the interconnecting links between them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that fragmented, disjointed administration would put these systems out of kilter with each other, which could have a devastating impact on the protection of personal data, on visa-related information and on asylum applications. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the creation of this specific agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems, as a measure to protect security and integrity in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I was not intending to waste the plenary’s time, but I was provoked by Mr Clark who said that another bureaucratic monster like the Stasi will be created.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to remind Mr Clark that the future home of the IT agency, or whatever we call it, is Tallinn, which is not the place where the Stasi was invented. Indeed, on the contrary another ‘S’ word, Skype, was invented by Estonian boys and girls some years ago. Beyond that Estonia was the first country to be under real cyber-attacks in the modern age and we survived. I believe Schengen, with the free movement of European people, will survive with us as well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as we know, better cooperation and various IT systems are supposed to compensate for the removal of internal borders. So far, the only example of such a project – the Schengen Information System (SIS II) – is noteworthy only for its skyrocketing costs and repeated delays. As far as I am concerned, it is doubtful whether there is even any point in having our own IT agency. In theory, it will link together the visa databases and the digital information on asylum seekers and criminals more effectively than has been done in the past. The scale of such an IT project is made evident by the fact that the Schengen Information System (SIS) was originally designed to handle 15 million records and is now required to handle 100 million – not least because of national differences. If data cannot be coordinated within one system without problems (in other words, within SIS and SIS II), it is critical that we ask how a separate IT agency is suddenly supposed to be able to link together all the vastly different systems. It seems to me to be a very difficult task.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, it has been apparent for some time that an agency needs to be set up to manage the sprawling IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. This will be another step on the way towards the smoother processing and use of information within the European Union. Obviously, the agency must meet the highest EU standards of data protection in its operations, and Member States which are not part of the system should be denied access to the information. As for the agency’s seat, I absolutely agree with the choice of a single centralised location, as this is the least costly solution and will make it easier for the agency’s various units to work together.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that the European Parliament has had an opportunity to make a major, direct contribution to the establishment of this agency, and I congratulate Mr Coelho.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, forgive me for arriving late, my plane departed very late, but I know you were in the capable hands of Commissioner Barnier. Let me thank you and the rapporteur for the debate, and let me quickly answer a few of the questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think Baroness Ludford asked whether the agency would cover any other IT systems. The agency will initially take over operational management of VIS and Eurodac. SIS II will also be taken over as soon as it is operational, i.e. in the first quarter of 2013. In the communication that the Commission made a few weeks ago, we also referred to the European entry/exit system and a registered travel programme. We also announced that we would conduct further consultations in the coming weeks, and this is what we will do, together with the Parliament and with the Council, regarding the communication on smart borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The plan is to entrust these systems, once they are in place, to the IT agency, working on the basis of the relevant instruments. I can assure Mr Albrecht that no other system will be put in place without a specific legal act, and that interoperability will not be introduced without the consent of the two co-legislators.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to Mr Enciu’s question on security, all safeguards are in place both from a legal and logistical point of view; I can reassure him of that. We have achieved something very worthwhile with this compromise between the three institutions. I am looking forward to this new agency becoming operational and starting work.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I too would like to welcome Commissioner Malmström. Before she arrived, I had occasion to remark that it is again proven that codecision is a powerful instrument, because if we still had the old system and this decision did not have codecision but was adopted unanimously by the Council, we would probably not have a decision because we would still be at a stalemate in the Council, awaiting a unanimous vote that we would never be able to attain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would like to say that I agree with the points made by Mr Marinescu. In fact, I would also have liked a management board with fewer members, but in these Schengen-related matters, which are based on mutual trust, it is very important that all Member States participate, and that is the only reason we have accepted a very large management board. However, it does not in fact make sense that all of our European agencies should have such large management boards.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mrs Flašíková Beňová and Mr Mikolášik raised the question of Member State participation. The truth is that the United Kingdom decided to participate in this regulation and Ireland decided to remain outside, but what we have ensured is, first of all, that the chair of this agency can only be from a Member State that participates in all the systems managed by the agency. In other words, those Member States that participate partially are not eligible to hold the chair. Secondly, and I will end here Madam President, only Member States that participate in each of the areas have access to the information. I therefore believe that those concerns are being protected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To end, Madam President, I would like to thank all of my fellow Members for their kind words. I think we have all been up to this challenge, and Parliament and the Council, with the help of the Commission, have demonstrated once more that we have managed to arrive at a first reading with great success in record time.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Coelho’s report has obtained my approval in this Chamber insofar as I am convinced of the need to establish an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. As the Commission itself had already stated in 2009, the management of systems such as SIS II, VIS and Eurodac, which are so complex and at the same time so crucial within the EU, cannot continue on the same temporary basis that has characterised them until today. Temporary management by the Commission cannot ensure the technical and operational capacity that, by contrast, the creation of an appropriate agency will allow. An agency will carry out its work on a continuous and constant basis, its principal duties being: the adoption of security measures, reporting and publishing, monitoring and organising specific training. I therefore fully agree with what has been decided in the report and have complete confidence that this is a further step towards ensuring that Europe remains on course to establish an integrated network for the development of security and democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">It has taken more than two years from the Commission’s proposal to the first reading in the Parliament. The establishment of the EU IT agency is a long-awaited step towards ensuring streamlined operational management of large-scale European Union IT systems, namely SIS II, VIS and Eurodac.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, from a long-term perspective, the agency ought also to become a centre of competence responsible for developing additional large-scale IT systems, should it be required to do so in the future and if the Parliament and the Council so decide. I am pleased that a compromise has been reached between Estonia and France to locate the seat of the agency in Tallinn, Estonia. This decision is in line with the European Council conclusions of 13 December 2003, which gave priority to the Member States that acceded to in 2004 and 2007 in the distribution of the seats of new EU offices and agencies. The agency is expected to begin work at the beginning of 2012. I therefore hope that the Parliament and the Council can adopt the regulation at first reading so that the agency can become operational on schedule.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have already adopted a number of resolutions on the subject of passenger name records (PNR), which include specific requirements. In all cases these have been concerned with necessity, appropriateness, proportionality and the prohibition of profiling. We consider the legal basis of the agreement with Australia to be inappropriate. The agreement with Australia is aimed at harmonising the transfer of data prescribed under Australian law with European law, and particularly the law on data protection. An absolute requirement, therefore, is that reference must be made to Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, we would question once again its proportionality. If you bear in mind that, according to the Australian Government, in 2009 just five people were traced and accused of terrorist offences – and it was not even clear whether this was achieved as a result of PNR data – then it does not seem particularly proportionate for millions of records nonetheless to be retained for years on end. As we all know, when it comes down to it they are being used for profiling purposes – and we do not even have a uniform agreed definition of profiling yet. I do not know how often the Commission has already been asked for such reasons to prove that the transfer of PNR data is necessary, or to present and look into alternatives. A really substantive report is necessary if this is to be investigated.</p>
      <p sl="de">One more comment on purpose limitation: how can we ensure that the data is used only for the intended purpose if various third countries conclude agreements with each other under which PNR data is systematically exchanged? This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to ensure this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, we are awaiting a very clear answer from the Commission on the relationship between PNR and the US Secure Flight programme. As everyone is aware, the purpose of the Secure Flight programme is to exclude so-called potentially dangerous passengers from flights. There have been frequent cases of mistakes being made and passengers being misidentified, as a result of which the persons concerned have been prevented from travelling and have practically no legal means by which to defend themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">One final word: please do not forget that we are talking not just about self-determination – about self-determination in the sphere of information – but also, and above all, about freedom of movement as a basic right, as laid down in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner Malmström, ladies and gentlemen, this esteemed House has repeatedly made clear what it expects before it is prepared to even consider accepting agreements on passenger name records (PNR).</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, we decided over a year ago that in no circumstances was PNR data to be used for so-called data mining or profiling. That means putting a stop to wholesale searches being carried out on an arbitrary basis and a return to investigation based on genuine cause. Yet what has the Commission delivered? A licence to link up and analyse all kinds of data for personality profiles and risk indicators. Ladies and gentlemen, that is not acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we expressly asked the Commission to obtain an expert opinion from the Fundamental Rights Agency. What has been done? Nothing whatsoever. It was only at our instigation that the Agency has now submitted a report on the planned EU PNR system, in which it has flagged up clear breaches of basic rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we expressly asked the Commission to obtain a data protection impact assessment. What has been done? Once again, nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, we have repeatedly demanded proof that such a measure is proportionate and necessary; in other words, that there is not a less intensive measure that could perform the same purpose. This proof has not been provided either.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased that the Polish Presidency wants to proactively address this issue. Commissioner Malmström, I find it embarrassing that you are evidently not in a position to resolve these issues. Instead you pull the blanket over your head like a frightened child. Please would you finally take note of the fact that there are huge legal problems with the PNR agreement and the planned EU system. Your own Legal Service says so. The Legal Service of the Council says so. The Fundamental Rights Agency says so. The European Data Protection Supervisor says so. Various highly regarded think-tanks say so. It is high time to put an end to this business of storing data ‘just in case’, on no basis whatsoever, in every area of life. Were you actually to present these PNR agreements to Parliament, then the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would insist on having them examined by the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="de">Representatives of the Commission, right from the start you have hushed things up, distorted the facts and concealed the truth. You have put on a brave face and in so doing pulled the wool over people’s eyes. It will not enable you to succeed, however.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I must admit to the House that I am a little confused where the debate on passenger name records (PNR) is concerned, because the facts and the issues that need to be clarified are not new. Nonetheless, one gets the impression that we are not making any progress – worse still, that we are moving back to worse conditions than those previously agreed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The signing of the agreement with Australia is currently also stalled because the Member States have asked for more time to review it. I fear that the reality is somewhat different, but I would like to hope that this has something to do with the fact that the Member States, too, have realised that not every means is justified in the fight against terror. As most of us here will remember, negotiations on the SWIFT Agreement were very difficult, but were eventually brought to a successful conclusion. I am astonished that we are now moving at a different level as regards data protection and data security, and I get the impression that we are back to standards below those that we have agreed previously. A retention period of 15 years is far too long. In the case of the 11 September 2001 attack that was so incisive for the US, for example, 15-year-old data would have been no help whatsoever because the perpetrators were much too young for data that was so old to have had any relevance.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, there is a very close link between proportionality and the use of data for a particular purpose. You cannot collect millions of data records from innocent citizens for 15 years and then say: ‘Actually, we are going to use this data for everything’, as is currently stated in the text of the US agreement. That is not acceptable. I would like to make it quite clear that this requirement applies not just to the US, but also to the Commission and to our Member States. If you adopt a measure to fight terrorism and serious international crime, then this measure must be limited to precisely that and cannot be expanded to allow other areas to be included by the back door.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to particularly thank the Commissioner for coming here this evening and of course Sophia in ’t Veld, our rapporteur, and all the other shadow rapporteurs who are still working hard on what has been a very long journey on these three PNR agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">I had hoped that in this plenary session we would be voting through the agreements between the EU, Canada, the US and Australia. However, for reasons which you have already heard and explained yourself, Commissioner, there are still outstanding issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that the swift adoption of these agreements is essential and that such agreements are an essential tool in the fight against terrorism. I think it is right that we use this time to ask the right questions and gather as much information as we can from the Commission as to the compatibility of such agreements with European law, and on their practical implementation. These questions will no doubt be raised once again in my own report on the EU PNR agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, for me personally, the necessity and the proportionality of these agreements have been long apparent from the number of crimes they have helped prevent, and the number of criminals that they have contributed to catching. These are serious crimes and serious criminals: murderers, rapists, drug-traffickers, child-traffickers and terrorists. The questions which we are asking here this evening are incredibly important. Answers to them would make the process of decision-making for this House a lot easier and a lot more informed.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will always be ideological differences within this House, for example as to how long data should be stored, and there are even those who would argue it should not be collected at all. But I believe we have reached a workable and reasonable conclusion on these questions which should satisfy all, with good safeguards and checks and rights for EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are at a crucial juncture, at which every negotiation and every process finds itself. A time when we have to move forward and do our jobs; when we have to look at what we have on the table and then make some positive decisions, and I hope that is the way that we will now go forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very much looking forward to the answers to these very detailed questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to start by adding yet another one. We know that South Korea and Qatar have repeatedly asked to begin negotiations with the European Commission for an agreement because they too are requesting the transfer of PNR. So far the Commission has turned their request down. That means that there is no legal basis for the transfer of data to those countries. We know that other countries will soon follow suit. I would like to know what the Commission’s course of action will be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to highlight one point from the oral question, and that is the issue of necessity and proportionality. The demonstration that we had two weeks ago in Manchester of the use of PNR underlined what we have been saying here for a long time. PNR data can, in particular circumstances, be useful, maybe even necessary, when people cross borders, but the long-term storage of data concerning all passengers remains very problematic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Essentially, what is being done is that data is stored because it may come in handy one day in order to solve crimes that have not yet been committed and that we are not aware of. That is not proportional and your own legal advisers and those of the Council agree. I look forward to your answer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, the challenge that we constantly face when it comes to data and data transfer is the endless search for balance between security and freedom. Freedom without security is fragile. Security without freedom is repressive. In other words, we need as much security as is necessary in order to allow freedoms, but not so much security that these freedoms are jeopardised. In my view, that is exactly what the debate on passenger name records (PNR) is about.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such a system can indeed generate greater security and make travel easier, but in this area – where we must constantly find the right balance – there is one question that continually arises, and that is: where is the line that we do not want to cross? These questions are our attempt to communicate this to you. There are legal problems. There are practical problems. There may be problems relating to its application generally under European law.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where the agreement with Australia is concerned, it seems to me that we have a good starting point that we can build on. The same cannot be said of the agreement with the US. This naturally leads us to ask – as Mrs in ’t Veld has just mentioned – just how so many different agreements can be reconciled with each other. What do the others want? To start with, we need to clarify exactly what profiling means. It may sound highly dangerous at first, but profiling can also be highly objective – as in the case of the UK authorities. That seems to me to be entirely acceptable. I have a feeling that this is our last opportunity where the US agreement is concerned, so we should continue negotiating in any event.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have a last brief question regarding Canada. I have heard that the negotiations have been broken off. I would be grateful if you could give me some feedback on this.</p>

    <intervention id="1-139-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me try to answer all these questions, which are indeed very detailed. But this is a good moment to take stock of where we are.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiations with the US, Australia and Canada have now reached an advanced stage. The negotiations with Australia have been concluded and the Commission has recommended that the Council sign and conclude the agreement and put it to Parliament. The procedure for signing is pending in the Council due to parliamentary scrutiny in some Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiations with the US are well advanced but still ongoing. The draft text has been made available to the Council and to some members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. The negotiations with Canada are also ongoing. There have been delays due to the parliamentary elections in Canada. We hope to be able to present you with a draft text very soon but I cannot undertake to do so before the summer break.</p>
      <p sl="en">So important decisions will shortly be made on these three agreements. Ms in ’t Veld and certain others mentioned agreements concerning numerous countries, but the aim is to make a single joint multilateral agreement out of these three bilateral agreements. But that is for later, there are no negotiations whatsoever ongoing with any other country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with a few remarks on necessity and proportionality and on profiling. The question of necessity and proportionality is something you face in many issues, including EU PNR. It is a very important question.</p>
      <p sl="en">This issue was analysed in depth in both our communication on PNR from last year and the impact assessment that accompanied the proposal for an EU PNR. The analysis essentially revealed three things: firstly, PNR is used by a growing number of countries globally to prevent and to bring to justice those guilty of serious crimes and terrorism. Serious crimes and terrorism continue to cause very serious harm to victims, as well as to the economy and citizens’ sense of security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, PNR can make a unique contribution because it helps identify people who are not known to be involved in criminal activities but whose travel patterns fit with those of drug smugglers or human traffickers. In other words, while simple passport data may not be enough to catch criminals already on the wanted list, PNR data makes it possible to identify a wider range of persons who are likely to pose a security risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, there is evidence that PNR data has already been successful in preventing and fighting serious crimes and terrorism, both in Member States and in third countries. Data has been particularly important in identifying and dismantling criminal networks involving crimes such as drug-smuggling and human trafficking. My services have already met with you once to present evidence on the necessity of PNR and there will be a follow-up meeting tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is therefore convinced that PNR is an important tool in fighting serious crime and terrorism, when it is complemented by strong data-protection guarantees and when the necessity and proportionality principles are respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of profiling was also raised. That has been discussed already and there is no exact definition of it in EU law. Profiling is generally understood to be an automatic data processing technique where a profile is applied to an individual in order to take a decision that affects him or her.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, therefore, three different uses of PNR: firstly, reactive use in specific investigations after the flight. Secondly, real-time use prior to the flight, by checking PNR against pre-determined risk assessment criteria and against databases on wanted persons. Thirdly, there is pro-active use – also known as trend analysis – to create or update risk assessment criteria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of these three uses of PNR data, only one – real-time use – might potentially be considered to be a form of profiling, in this case the checking of the PNR against pre-determined risk assessment criteria. To ensure that this use will not adversely affect individuals, the new EU-Australia PNR agreement explicitly prohibits automated processing and always requires human involvement before adverse decisions are taken on the basis of PNR data.</p>
      <p sl="en">This prohibition was not present in the PNR agreement from 2007, so it is an important step forward. The Commission is seeking to have the same provisions included in the US and Canadian agreements. A similar provision is also included in the Commission’s proposal for the directive on the European PNR.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s approach to both the European PNR and PNR agreements with third countries is therefore in line with EU data protection legislation, which grants every individual the right not to be subject to a decision which produces legal effects concerning him or her, and which is based exclusively, or to a decisive extent, on automated processing of data on him or her. Against this background, the Commission is not convinced of the need to develop any new legal definition of profiling.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the EU-Australia agreement, the Commission’s view is that the new agreement respects the Council’s negotiating mandate and the resolution of this House. We consider that it respects the principles of necessity and proportionality. We should bear in mind that the agreement has a well-defined and specific purpose limitation – a limited period of detention of all PNR. PNR will be masked-out a short time after the flight and stored anonymously. Strict conditions apply on transfers of data to third countries and PNR must be transmitted by air carriers exclusively by the ‘push’ method. The question of proportionality should be viewed in the general context of the laws of the third country, in this case Australia, and the security threat faced by that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members have raised important questions on dispute resolution, suspension and termination. The procedures for terminating the agreement would be the same as those for concluding the agreement and therefore Parliament’s role is fully assured.</p>
      <p sl="en">Suspension of the agreement is regulated by Article 218(9) of the Treaty. There is no formal role for Parliament. However, a parliamentary resolution calling for a suspension would certainly be a very important political consideration for whether the Commission would desire to launch such a procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission agrees with the European Court of Justice that the main purpose of PNR agreements is police and judicial cooperation, and not data protection. That was confirmed in 2005 by the European Court of Justice in the US PNR case. It was clearly stated that PNR agreements should be drawn up using the legal bases for police and judicial cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the US agreement, you asked whether there were any bilateral agreements between the US and Member States on PNR. This issue was discussed in detail in this House in October 2010. The US signed a memorandum of understanding with several Member States as part of the Visa Waiver Programme. The memorandum of understanding was intended to commit the parties – the US and the specific Member States – to enter into negotiations on passenger information, information on the screening of known or suspected terrorists, information to combat terrorism and serious crime and information on migration and border security matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">The memorandum of understanding was not intended to be in itself the legal basis for the exchange of data between that Member State and the US. It merely expressed the intention of the two parties to have specific agreements to govern the exchange of data. Only such an agreement would then be the legal basis for exchanging data.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to implement the memorandum of understanding, the US and the relevant Member States signed only two types of agreement, namely agreements on enhancing cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime and agreements on the exchange of screening information concerning known or suspected terrorists.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following that debate, and in the context of the negotiations, we again examined the issue, and asked both the Member States and the US whether there were any bilateral agreements between them on PNR. Both sides replied categorically negatively. Both the Member States and the US assure us that the only agreement regulating PNR is the one that the US signed with the EU in 2007. No further agreement exists.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secure flight data are not to be confused with PNR data. They differ both in nature and in function. They are much more limited in scope since secure flight data include only the name, date of birth and gender of passengers. Such data are used by the US authorities exclusively to prevent individuals already known to pose a security risk – i.e. those on the US no-fly list – from boarding an aircraft. Secure flight data is collected by air carriers on behalf of the US authorities and PNR data is collected by air carriers for their own commercial purposes. To reduce their economic burden, carriers generally choose to provide the required secure data with the PNR data to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On receipt, the secure flight data is retrieved from the PNR and stored separately for seven days and then deleted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another very important issue is ad hoc ‘pulls’ by the US authorities. Last year’s joint review acknowledged that there was a problem with regard to both the number of ad hoc requests for PNR data and the fact that the DHS executed such requests by ‘pulling’ the data. It strongly called for improvements to this state of affairs and for the US authorities to step up their efforts to encourage air carriers to use the ‘push’ method of transmission only.</p>
      <p sl="en">The US has acknowledged that the high frequency of ‘pulls’ is problematic. The issue is being re-discussed in the context of negotiations with the US on the new PNR agreement. The Commission’s aim is to ensure that data are transferred using the ‘push’ method, with recourse to ‘pulls’ only in strictly limited circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, you asked about the opinion of our Legal Service. I can say that the Commission is seeking improvements to the text on a small number of key issues. We have emphasised to the US that the support of both the Council and the Parliament is needed for the final outcome of the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of the transfer of data between the US and Canada, this was, and continues to be, governed by the memorandum of understanding signed between those two countries. Its purpose is the sharing of ‘look-out’ and advance passenger information data between Canadian border service agencies and the United States Customs and Border Protection to identify high-risk travellers and facilitate the flow of legitimate persons across the border.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have carefully assessed these agreements on a strictly confidential basis and we are convinced that they do not violate the PNR agreements with either country.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry this was long but there were very many questions that I had to answer. I hope I have adequately answered the questions asked in this plenary.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, our resolutions on issues of internal security will reflect our basic European values faithfully only if they express a continuous balance between safety and freedom. It is worth drawing attention to the fact that security, similarly to data protection, is a fundamental right of citizens. It is true that many look at profiling with hysterical rage as if it were the devil’s instrument, but do we know what profiling and data mining really mean? Do we know what we are really talking about?</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is indispensable for the Commission to create the necessary definitions – with almost scientific thoroughness – because we cannot combat the present forms of terrorism and organised crime successfully with conventional means of criminal investigation. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that profiling is a well-established and very efficient method in the broadest sense of the word in the criminal investigation procedures of Member States, and is applied without major problems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, when talking about PNR agreements to be concluded with third countries, we cannot avoid addressing the PNR issue of the EU itself. It would be very advantageous for the EU, for its Member States and for the aviation industry if our PNR system was centralised. If we really think that mutual data transfer is important, that is, not only to provide, but also receive information from third countries, then we have to establish a unified European institutional framework here, in the EU, which will really be able to collect and process data, providing equal access to information to all Member States. Although we have heard several proposed solutions to this issue, the final solution has not been found yet. We should consider the possibility that the most efficient solution could be to give Europol competences which would allow it to play a leading role in the operation of the PNR mechanism of the EU. I suggest that we consider these possibilities when negotiating the future mandate of Europol.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, in May and November last year, Parliament spelt out quite clearly in its resolutions what it was expecting from the negotiations on access to passenger name record data. The Commission was to ensure that agreements with Australia, Canada and the United States would respect European Union law on personal data protection.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The United States has been mentioned here. Looking back over the 10-year history of our mutual negotiations, the US has unilaterally imposed conditions on the European Union, but on the rare occasions when a request has been made by the Union, the United States has refused even to think about modifying its data protection system.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The opinion delivered in May by the Commission Legal Services on the agreement between the EU and the US left no room for doubt: in its current form, the agreement violates fundamental rights. The Commission’s response was to send us the text of this agreement untouched, two days after the opinion was published. If the agreement remains in this form, I hope Parliament will exercise its authority and refuse to approve the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Commissioner, we do want to see the agreement approved, and we will gladly approve it, but not until it respects European data protection standards such as proportionality, purpose limitation, legal redress and the guarantee of independent review.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be very brief.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I am intrigued to hear about the plans for a multilateral agreement for all the other countries. I am wondering why they get different treatment and when this will start, because some countries are already asking for PNR.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on the legal opinions of the Commission and Council Legal Services, they were actually not on minor issues. They went right to the core. They challenged the core: the proportionality and the necessity of long-term storage. I would like to hear a little more about that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, regarding the legal basis, the European Court of Justice did not confirm police and justice cooperation as a legal basis; it simply rejected Article 95 – internal markets – as a legal basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Commissioner, on ‘push’ and ‘pull’, the Parliament’s resolution is crystal clear: ‘push’ only. No ‘pull’: not even a little bit of ‘pull’. It is like being pregnant: you cannot be ‘a little bit’ pregnant. There is no such thing as ‘a little bit’ of ‘pull’. ‘Pull’ is giving a log-in to a third country. ‘Push’ only!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I think that there is no excuse here for the lack of clarity. We are facing a paradigm change in investigation. Citizens know that, previously, they were investigated if they were suspected of a crime or if they had committed a crime. What happens with the processing of passenger name record (PNR) data is that everyone is investigated, including innocent people, and therefore, whether or not this is justified, proportional or necessary, it is essential that citizens are told clearly that they are being investigated, even when they are innocent. This cannot happen without a very clear debate with the citizens, particularly when their data are in the hands of third countries, as is the case. This is why we are discussing the agreement with the United States here today.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Most people would agree to their data being used to stop a terrorist blowing up the plane in which they are flying. That is not the issue. However, what would people say if a large part of their data, including credit card details and addresses, were in the hands of a third country for 15 years, a long time after the aeroplane had reached its destination? This is what is happening now with the agreement that we have with the United States. Let us be clear: over 15 years many administrations come and go, so an administration that says that it will not carry out data mining might do so at a later date. It is therefore necessary for the agreement to be perfectly clear, as I believe that the agreement that we have today contains large gaps and loopholes that can be exploited for different purposes. I would like to know what the Commission is going to do to close these big gaps in the agreement that we have at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, how can the fight against terrorism and crime be reconciled with the protection of personal data? Since 11 September 2011, security-related legislation and the recording of personal data have been amplified, namely on the grounds that current techniques should allow us to progress towards ‘zero insecurity’ while carrying out ever increasing checks on our fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Numerous studies now show, however, the adverse effects of this legislation; Commissioner, even the Commission’s own Legal Service and the European Data Protection Supervisor acknowledge these effects, but nothing is being done about them. Personal data continues to be recorded and increasingly so. You state that results can be seen: I remain perplexed and I would in this respect like to refer to a comment made by a US senator in encouraging the US Government to stand its ground. He said: ‘Since the agreement with the EU was signed, at least two terrorists have been arrested.’ How many thousands of people’s personal data have been recorded for two terrorists? Could their arrests not have been achieved by other means? Of course they could, especially as the two persons in question were arrested after having made very numerous plane trips between their country and the United States. Moreover, one of them was not even arrested in the US. Therefore why is the number of people for whom we record data increasing? Why is the period for which data are held being increased to 15 years? Why do we hand over such great quantities of data, including bank details, without the least guarantee as to how they are used as far as profiling and passing on to third countries are concerned, and without our fellow citizens having the least guarantee as to whether legal action is possible?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have to say, Commissioner, that I found your answers unconvincing.</p>
      <a text="(The President interrupted the speaker)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I remain unsatisfied and I maintain that it is not through wide-scale recording of personal data that the problem will be solved, but rather by allocating resources, and in particular human resources, to the departments concerned.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have just three very simple and brief questions for the Commissioner. The Commission has already received various legal opinions on the subject of passenger name records (PNR). We asked the Commission to provide us with the three most recent. In response we have received just the cover pages of two, and nothing at all of the third.</p>
      <p sl="de">My question to you is as follows: is that what you mean by transparent policy, and when are you going to publish the most recent opinions by the Legal Service? This is very important, because above all there is a suspicion that the applicable law is being breached.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second question concerns proportionality. The retention periods in the drafts vary from five to 15 years. My specific question to you is: what retention period would you consider to be no longer proportionate – 15, 20, 30, 100 years? Perhaps you could provide us with specific figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third question concerns necessity. The Commission has yet to provide adequate figures on the costs. When will the Commission finally commission an independent study that guarantees cost transparency?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as one minute is not long, could I just check whether the Commissioner answered the question about the scope of the US agreement. I am not sure if we heard your answer to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have said what the status of the various negotiations is. For the Socialist and Democrat Group there are currently too many differences between the PNR negotiations. It is important that, regardless of what third state we are negotiating with, we build on common principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we cannot have vastly different standards of protection for European citizens depending on which third state they are flying to. By doing this we risk creating an incentive for Member States to begin to develop bilateral agreements which will then undermine our work at EU level. We should ensure full respect for the Charter. The scope – as everyone has said – should not be unnecessarily wide. Data retention periods should respect the tests of proportionality and necessity and we should have proper redress.</p>
      <p sl="en">All of these principles are still up for grabs in some of the negotiations. If the EU institutions’ own legal services are providing opinions against the current status of negotiations, then we should listen and ensure the agreements we put in place respect the fundamental rights of EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the high-flown statements from the EU that it would ensure adequate data protection have now been exposed even by the Commission’s own Legal Service as mere window-dressing, as has been our criticism all along. Fundamental rights, human rights and data protection are clearly foreign concepts to the Americans in the so-called fight against terror. Millions of data records are being stored there, airlines are being forced to pass on data and passengers are being refused entry to the US without even being told on what suspicions the decision is based. Part of the Commission’s negotiating mandate was to bring to an end the illegal blackmail that is forcing the airlines to hand over data. While the retention periods in the Australian agreement have been set at five and a half years, without sensitive data being released, the US Department of Homeland Security is to continue to be given 15 years more or less unrestricted access to all personal data. It is all too Orwellian.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is one thing to retain data on suspects, but hoarding data on innocent citizens is quite unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, as we have seen throughout this afternoon’s debate, we are still far from reaching a conclusion on this issue, because in my opinion – and Parliament has taken the same view – there is not much transparency in the talks held by the Commission with the various countries, and there are many outstanding and confusing issues that we do not fully understand. It is a very important agreement, because the common standards to be used in the agreement with the United States will later serve as a benchmark for other agreements, and above all for the European Passenger Name Records (PNR), for which I am going to be a shadow rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe it is important to have the maximum possible level of transparency, and for us to know exactly, for example, when the ‘pull’ system mentioned here will be used. What will the profiles consist of, exactly? It is not acceptable for a person to be prevented from travelling and to be monitored because he or she has the same surname as a citizen of the same country who is being sought for drug trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="es">There have been many mistakes.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, Commissioner, you have replied to some of the concerns but, unfortunately, it seems to me that, once again, we have before us an offer which the citizens of Europe simply cannot and should not accept. This proposal does not improve the standards of protection of personal data, as even our Legal Service has recognised.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I get the impression that someone is persistently turning a blind eye. Will practically any reason, even the slightest crime, really justify our personal data being stored in this way? We need to know for exactly what purposes the US authorities will be using the data. We cannot allow them to use the data of many millions of passengers, including their credit card numbers, at US borders for security purposes unrelated to the prevention of terrorism and serious crime. This is a major retrograde step for the protection of personal data.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I do not know how we are going to explain to people that the US authorities may store our records for up to 15 years. The draft agreement is highly inconsistent with fundamental human rights. We have every reason to reject it.

Data protection is regulated in the EU by Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 8 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. The joint bilateral efforts to counter terrorism are not what is in dispute here. Nonetheless, I wish to make it clear that protecting the privacy of our citizens is of the utmost importance and is highly valued by them.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, many thanks to Commissioner Malmström for her answers. I especially liked it when she stated that this system is useful when (and this was the word she used, ‘when’) data are strongly protected. Now, the question that is raised is this: are we or are we not faced with a system, particularly with regard to the United States, in which European legislation on data protection is being respected? The Commissioner has legal opinion at her disposal. It seems to us that there is an attempt to force us to adapt to their data protection standard. As this concerns our data, however, it is they who have to adapt to our legal framework, and we have to be assured of this. However, it is not obvious whether this is actually happening in terms of proportionality and the use and retention of data.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, the Commissioner gave the idea that ‘pull’ was possible in certain circumstances. I would remind you of what Mrs in ’t Veld said: that is, according to the European Parliament, no ‘pull’ is possible; only the ‘push’ system should be allowed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here in the issue of passenger name record (PNR) data transfer we are not talking about cooperation in the field of data protection, but about data protection error. It is simply an offence that the United States reckons that Europe is not able to filter criminals. It is extremely dangerous to give out data of European Union citizens especially in these circumstances, when the United States can store even the most private and most confidential information for 15 years. Let me ask you, who will decide who is a terrorist or a suspected terrorist in Europe? My other question to you is what will we receive in return, if this agreement – God forbid – were to be concluded? The other important point is that the EU must at last realise that it has grown up, and must change its attitude to the effect that it should enter only into agreements concluded on the basis of parity, be it with the United States, Canada or Australia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will comment on a few specific questions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The multilateral agreement that was announced in the communication on external PNR – where we also outlined a few guiding principles – will be based on the Australian system. On the legal basis, the Parliament’s Legal Service said in 2007 that the correct legal basis was police cooperation. With regard to the costs of the EU PNR, an impact assessment and an independent study have been conducted on costs. They are on our website and Members are welcome to look at them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be very clear about what we discussed today. Today we have three agreements with Australia, Canada and the US. We have decided jointly to renegotiate them. What we have achieved so far is a huge improvement, but there are no texts before you today to vote upon because negotiations are still ongoing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am here today to answer a few questions and I hope I can provide some clarifications. I am willing to hold further discussions, but we already have agreements and we are trying to make improvements to them. So far we have improved them immensely in terms of definition, clarity, data protection and legal clarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">There will be developments and processes will be defined, but let me remind you that a country has the sovereign right to decide who can land on its territory and to impose certain conditions. We cannot change that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I cannot discuss ongoing negotiations; I cannot go into details. I cannot comment on leaked documents. I have tried to provide as much information as possible to the coordinators, the rapporteur and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. I am willing to continue to do so and to discuss all texts we draw up as the process continues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am quite positive that we will reach an agreement that considers both the necessity to protect our citizens against terrorism and organised crime and that also includes robust provisions on data protection. But today we were here to answer questions on certain issues. I have done my best to do that. I am sorry if you do not like the answers but there is nothing to vote on today. Hopefully there will be before too long and then we will most likely have the chance to discuss it.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime the Commission is available to provide information. Mr Priebe will come to the committee tomorrow to give further information on the necessity and proportionality of PNR and provide some statistics. We are willing to come and see Members at any time to inform them and discuss specific details.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, 30 million people in the European Union suffer from malnutrition and a further 79 million live below the poverty threshold. Most of them depend on food aid provided primarily by food banks.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some 40% of the funds needed to provide this food come from contributions made by the Union, through the European Scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union. This scheme has been implemented to date in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 983/2008 establishing aid for the purchase of cereals, skimmed milk powder and rice. The Regulation was partially revoked in April by the General Court of the European Union, with the budget for food aid being reduced from EUR 500 million to EUR 133 million.</p>
      <p sl="es">The integration of the European Union has historically been based on the principle of solidarity. This is why, Mr President, we urge the new Polish Presidency and the European Parliament, now more than ever, to show their commitment to helping the most deprived, and to re-establishing the budget appropriation that is currently so limited.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Community legislation governing relations under family law comprehensively addresses matters such as the territorial jurisdiction of the competent courts and the law applicable to international marriages and child contact and care. It fails to provide sufficient protection, however, to the parties concerned, in other words, the children, resulting in cases where children are often used as pawns in the settling of scores between former spouses or partners.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Strict adherence to the letter of the law leads to situations where Member State courts allow the natural bond between mother and child to be broken. For this reason, I would like to call on the European Union’s competent institutions to harmonise current legislation with the utmost possible respect for the protection of the positive interests of the child, and not only by means of vague escape-route provisions that are difficult to apply in practice, such as Article 12 of the Brussels II Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is also important for courts to adopt a sympathetic, natural and ethical approach to the settlement of such disputes, particularly with regard to protecting the rights and legitimate interests of the child.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, another flotilla is heading for Gaza and it is provoking passionate debate on the appropriateness, necessity and dangers of such an initiative. My impression is that the whole media storm over the flotilla – the ultimate fate of which cannot yet be determined – is, in fact, nothing but a smokescreen, designed to prevent us from discussing, in an appropriate way and with sufficient focus and responsibility, the actual situation in Gaza, where one and half million people have lived in inhumane conditions since 2007.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The situation in Gaza is not set to change for the better, and even the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is no closer to an acceptable solution now than it was five, ten or thirty years ago. The only possible solution is: a two-state solution, two countries, living in peace, mutual respect and mutual recognition.</p>
      <p sl="sl">An important step in the right direction would come if Israel restored dignity to the people of Gaza. If that were the case, humanitarian actions, such as the flotilla, would no longer be necessary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the closure of the railway line between Porto and Vigo was announced today. The region of the North of Portugal and Galicia has suffered a severe blow with this loss. This line has disappeared because it is no longer of use. It has ceased to be of use because it is no longer suited to the current conditions of modern life, and this has only occurred because there has been no investment in recent times.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Europe says it is committed to railways and sustainable collective transport. However, a study carried out in Portugal, at the request of the Troika, is calling for the closure of more than 800 kilometres of railway line in Portugal. Two weeks ago, a narrow majority of this Parliament rejected a proposal which would have placed productive investment outside the calculation of the deficit. This proposal was not passed, although measures such as this would have saved the railway line by allowing it be modernised. Mr President, the conclusion of all of this is a sad one. The dictatorship of the deficit is killing public services in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my constituency, Northern Ireland, has seen many changes in recent years. It is a more stable and peaceful place to live in as it emerges from a terrorist campaign that has seen many lives lost, and many families bereaved.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, deep-rooted problems remain. We have recently experienced the dangers of Republican terrorism, which resulted in the death of two young soldiers shortly before they were to be deployed to Afghanistan. The callous murder of two police officers and recent rioting just last week in Belfast show how community tension can still erupt into violence. The number of ‘peace walls’ separating communities has never been higher. Often these walls separate communities suffering from high and generational unemployment, low educational attainment and poor health, including problems with mental health and growing rates of suicide.</p>
      <p sl="en">During a recent visit to Northern Ireland, Commissioner Hahn was able to see at first hand the huge contribution that the European Peace Fund is making to people across Northern Ireland.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, on 17 June the Venice Commission adopted an opinion on the new Hungarian Constitution, a matter also discussed at length in the European Parliament. I view this in a positive light and trust that the Hungarian Government and Parliament will reflect on the initiatives emerging from this debate.</p>
      <p sl="sk">From the point of view of neighbourly relations between Slovakia and Hungary, it is good that the Venice Commission expressed views on those parts of the Constitution which have also provoked concern in Slovakia, in particular the article declaring that Hungary is responsible for the fate of Hungarians living abroad and should encourage them to exercise their individual and collective rights. The Commission has made it clear that responsibility for the protection of minorities rests primarily with their home states.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The approach taken by Hungary in implementing the Constitution will be vital. The drafting of the framework and implementing legislation will be an opportunity for Hungary to remove ambiguities and to reduce the tensions produced by the Constitution. I wish our Hungarian friends much success in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I underline the importance of free movement of workers who directly participate in and benefit from the EU project. European citizens are taking advantage of this right, not only working in different Member States, but also building a new life, career, and families. The free movement of workers did not create turbulence on labour markets. On the contrary, it contributed to the economic growth of Member States that opened their labour markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once you work in a country you become a contributor to the budget of that country. Consequently you should legally receive social security benefits.

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to draw your attention to the frequent incidents involving a disgraceful practice which has become established at Sofia airport where passengers’ luggage is opened without authorisation and items frequently go missing from it. I receive numerous complaints from passengers who are receiving their suitcases with locks broken and finding out that their personal belongings are missing. No effective action has been taken so far to tighten control over luggage handling and stop this practice, in spite of the warnings given to Sofia Airport EAD.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The breaches of security and safety requirements, along with the unauthorised access to passengers’ luggage, could provide an opportunity for a terrorist attack or some other attack being carried out with tragic consequences. These facts are evidence of gross contempt for European aviation regulations and the provision of airport services.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I urge the Bulgarian authorities to carry out stringent inspection and monitoring of the ground operators who have been awarded licences.

      <p sl="es">The chairman of the panel said the city was chosen to support the peace process but, as far as I am aware, there is a terrorist organisation in Spain, called ETA, that so far has not laid down its weapons and which two months ago managed to get its political wing, Bildu, into government in San Sebastián, as well as other towns. I do not believe that Europe should be giving such a powerful megaphone to people who fail to condemn terrorist violence and who will create propaganda out of apportioning blame between victims and murderers.</p>
      <p sl="es">Where is the right to freedom and dignity? Clearly not in San Sebastián, where our fellow Members such as Mayor Oreja, Mr Iturgaiz, Mr Zalba, and I myself have to go around with bodyguards. I believe in the culture of life, not in a bullet to the back of the head. Ladies and gentlemen, can there be any true culture without freedom? No, a thousand times no.</p>
      <p sl="es">San Sebastián should once again submit its candidacy when it is a city that is free for everyone. In the meantime, they should learn the culture of respect towards those who think differently, because although the city may deserve the title in future, today, with Batasuna and its successors in its institutions, it does not.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this evening I wish to voice my anger and to protest against the treatment that is being meted out to the ships from the ‘Gaza Freedom Flotilla’ and the pacifist militants who had the courage to board the boats to protest against the blockade on Gaza, this repeated violation of international law. None of the ships will be allowed to leave. Militants are being dragged before the courts; ships have been sabotaged. Everybody condemns the blockade, but once again we are giving way to pressure from Israel, as it threatens a repeat of last year’s violence and killings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Greek Government tells us it wanted to avoid a blood bath. Where is the law? Those who support the Palestinian people are insulted and even brought before the courts. In France, just under 400 politicians were recently called collaborators and compared to those who denounced Jews during the Second World War, because of their support for the fleet. This is unacceptable. I am sick and tired of these double standards. What justification can Israel give for continuing to abuse and kill Palestinians? It may have proclaimed itself to be the Jewish State, but this does not mean it speaks for all the Jews in the world. There are people proving this to us every day. The Holocaust was a horrific tragedy …</p>

However, I would also like to ask for people to stop criticising the decision of the panel of judges and, above all, to stop undervaluing the great bid that the city presented.</p>
      <p sl="es">The bid submitted, ‘Waves of people’s energy’, is the result of shared enthusiasm, of thousands of people and different organisations all working towards a common goal – culture as a way of promoting understanding between different peoples.</p>
      <p sl="es">San Sebastián is already a leading venue for culture because of its international film festival, its jazz festival and its human rights festival, but the bid that won the title of European Capital of Culture goes far beyond this, offering an incredible number of activities ranging from a meeting of Nobel Prize winners and a network of green spaces for culture to a G20 of NGOs and a project combining art and cuisine.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Hungary has been a Member State of the European Union for seven years now, and these seven years are more than sufficient to evaluate the social aspect of our membership. In 2004, Hungarians were lured with promises that if we joined the EU, we would be able to open patisseries in Vienna. This was advertised on huge billboards. Well, the truth is that seven years later, Hungarian residents earn EUR 340 a month, while residents in Western Europe make EUR 1 000–1 200 monthly. Hungarian teachers earn EUR 300–400, and retired people receive an average pension of EUR 200–250. In Western Europe they can make eight or even ten times this amount, and yes, around 300 people freeze to death each year in Hungary in the 21st century, and not only can we not open patisseries in Vienna, but we have no more sugar factories under Hungarian ownership. The reality is that Western Europe did not need Eastern Europe for unification in the spirit of great, majestic European ideas, but for market and cheap labour.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, it is very important to develop economic relations between China and the European Union. However, we must also raise openly the question of the differing interpretation of human and minority legal problems, just like the UK and German heads of government did. The Hungarian Prime Minister, on the other hand, failed to address this issue. Mr Orbán, departing from common EU guidelines, called China our strategic ally, the country which applies human rights as it prefers, restricts freedom of speech and press freedom, and severely violates the rights of Tibetan and other minorities. Can we consider China a strategic ally in these questions as well? During the Chinese Prime Minister’s visit to Hungary, the immigration authorities intervened harshly to prevent the peaceful demonstration of the Tibetan minority. Many protested against this move, including Fidesz MEPs Mr József Szájer, Mrs Kinga Gál and Mr András Gyürk. Had they expressed their concerns at the time of the adoption of the Hungarian Constitution and the media law, this would have provided more support to the authenticity of their exemplary protest.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, last week a panel of judges, the members of which included European Commission officials, decided that Donostia-San Sebastián should be European Capital of Culture in 2016. The panel of judges believes that the Basque goal of bringing together and creating brotherhood between people with different ideas, from different races, backgrounds and languages deserved to win. The proposal won because it is original and constructive, because it is driven by the public and because it is backed up by the enthusiasm and impetus of the whole of society and its institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">The latest elections showed that the people wanted the City Council of Donostia to change hands, but the winning bid and the team behind it are still the same. However, for some Spanish media outlets and politicians, they have now gone from being deserving of recognition to being a danger to state security. These kinds of insults and disparaging remarks, which have also been directed at the panel of judges of the European Capital of Culture, makes one wonder why they are questioning democracy and diversity. We have the right to show the world an image of an open, welcoming, prosperous and proactive Basque Country, and we will do so with the winning proposal, because there is a lot more to us than violence and terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, an extremely important topic has dominated the public agenda in Romania recently: administrative restructuring. Unfortunately, the debates have touched more on the format of the project than on its substance. Administrative restructuring is one of the current hot topics, especially for new Member States. The European Parliament regards it as important because it has two major effects: increasing the level of absorption of European funds and improving relations between local communities and national authorities. At the same time, it means decentralisation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">For these reasons, I think that it is important for us to talk about European models for administrative restructuring. From a strategic development perspective, this process will result, in the years ahead, in an irreversible breakaway from the concept of a Communist state.

This means that tinned fish imported into Europe may contain Japanese fish. The provision of precise information about place of origin is crucial and urgent.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Last week in Portugal, the Portuguese Parliament approved the government’s programme, and the government took advantage of the moment to announce an extraordinary tax which will see half of people’s Christmas bonus taken away. In order to deal with the deficit, there is no hesitation to worsen the recession in which my country already finds itself. The Union, Europe, is also responsible because the authorities’ obsession with the deficit stems from there. However, in contrast to these recessive policies, the Irish Government announced a reduction in VAT for restaurants, hotels and the leisure industry. My question is this: why is it impossible in Portugal and Greece to do what is possible and desirable in Ireland?

      <p sl="es">Mr President, last Saturday thousands of people all over Europe celebrated Gay Pride Day, 30 years after the world’s first case of AIDS was discovered. Thirty years later, the battle against HIV across the planet is still unequal depending on the place where the infected person lives and, beyond this, the social class to which the person belongs, just as the rights of homosexual people differ profoundly depending on their country of residence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today there are still 76 countries around the world where sexual relations between people of the same sex are punished, and at least seven of these countries impose the death penalty. This is why the United Nations Resolution approved on 17 June is of such enormous importance, in that it utterly rejects this attitude and urgently calls on these countries to change such attitudes and such legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I want to join this appeal today, and also the appeal against the blocking of the Equal Treatment Directive, which grants, or which could grant, equal rights and the same equal opportunities to this large group of citizens in the European Union, thereby marking out the direction in the European Union for what should be a common direction all over the world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, last week the European Commission revealed its proposed financial framework for the 2014-2020 period. The document presented by the Commission is balanced with regard to the proposals for the various European policies and maintains the stability of the structure and the seven-year period of the financial framework. The framework is now clearly aimed at the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and introduces greater simplicity, more transparency and equity to the financing system.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The cohesion policy keeps a sizeable budget, which is welcome, with a focus on results, added value and the creation of the new category of transition regions. However, the concern with the territorial dimension, which was underlying this measure, was forgotten for the outermost regions. Even though a specific provision is still in existence for the outermost regions, its value was reduced from EUR 979 million to EUR 926 million between 2014 and 2020, and this is worrying if we take into consideration the permanent difficulties and future challenges which will be faced by these regions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, during the plenary session last month, the European Parliament strongly condemned the Ukrainian Government’s practices of influencing the judicial system with the aim of compromising the opposition leaders, by adopting an emergency resolution.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to point out that these kinds of practices, perhaps even worse than this, are not only going on outside the European Union, but also in Romania, an EU Member State. The current government has managed to take control of part of the state judicial system for its own political interests. President Băsescu does not miss any opportunity to demonstrate this, by giving sneak previews of criminal prosecutions, inquiries and arrests being launched. Fabricating cases against the leaders of the opposition on government orders and selective criminal prosecutions are, unfortunately, generally widespread practices in Romania. The European Parliament must condemn the Romanian Government’s practices which are jeopardising the rule of law and democracy by adopting a resolution, just as it did in the case of Ukraine.</p>

      <p sl="it">This contribution was linked to certain conditions. The first was consultation with and approval by local communities, which, however, have never been heard on the substance of the problem – quite the opposite, they have recently been repressed by the downright militarisation of the Val di Susa, which is the area of this tunnel.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second condition related to certain deadlines for the start of work, deadlines that have instead been arbitrarily delayed several times. To date the only works carried out in the area have been a fortified enclosure holding the 900 police who are supposed to control people and keep them away. Under these highly illegal conditions, for the EU to provide the planned contribution would amount to no more than giving in to a scam perpetrated by the Italian Government and the Piedmont regional government and by the lobbies that influence them heavily. ‘Achtung!

Irrespective of the problems encountered by new Member States in adapting to the European Union’s rules, I do not believe that they entitle a Member State to discriminate against other citizens who enjoy the same rights as every other citizen in EU countries.</p>

A reference was made earlier to Denmark’s gesture of introducing customs checkpoints at EU internal borders. I do not believe that we can let European integration be hijacked by populist and extremist parties who fuel the general public’s fears and attack the European Union’s founding values in order to achieve hypothetical electoral victories.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, less than 50% of secondary school leavers in Romania passed the leaving certificate exam this year. These are the poorest results in the last 20 years. It is no coincidence that this is happening under a government which has awarded education the lowest percentage of GDP in the last 20 years: 2.73% as opposed to 6%, as stipulated by law. It is also the smallest budget allocation for education in the whole European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This year teachers saw their salaries drop by up to 60%. Many teaching staff have chosen to leave the system in order to survive. There has been no investment at all in this education system during the last two years. Major decisions, such as school closures, have been made without any consultation with parents, teachers, trade unions or European partners. All this is going on at a time when the European Union should be targeting the Europe 2020 programme’s objectives, which also include the promotion of knowledge, innovation and education.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me from this august forum to draw your attention to a problem in my country for which, unfortunately, there is still no effective solution. The current Bulgarian Government is about to condemn to an ecological disaster a whole region in our country, which is not very big to start with, by granting a permit for gold extraction from mines in the Krumovgrad region to the Canadian company Dundee Precious Metals. Apart from the permit being granted at ridiculously low prices, there is important documentation missing from it, such as the environmental impact assessment. However, this is not all. The region is part of a protected area and comes under Natura 2000. However, this too is missing from the documentation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I wonder, ladies and gentlemen, what makes people breach clear-cut nature conservation regulations and condemn a whole region to destruction. Is it the money Bulgaria will get from the permit or the money which the government will collect for it? I urge attention to be focused on this patently corrupt deal and that the guilty parties will be held to account for this. I will also contact the European Commission as I hope that, if Bulgaria is unable to, then Europe will be able to protect this region where nature and architecture have coexisted for centuries. It is this relationship which will be destroyed right from the first explosion in the Krumovgrad mines.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, how many minutes do I have?</p>
      <p sl="el">However many I have, I have lost some time due to interpretation. I shall start and you can stop me.</p>
      <a text="(The President advised the rapporteur that she had four minutes)"/>
      <p sl="el">My report is on the subject of the European 112 emergency number and the universal service. The 112 number is extremely useful. However, it is as little known as it is useful. Based on the statistics supplied by Eurobarometer for February 2011, only 26% of EU citizens can spontaneously identify the 112 number as the number to call in an emergency. Our target is to achieve 80% spontaneous identification by EU citizens of the 112 number as the number to call in an emergency by 2020, an ambitious target which, if it is to be achieved, depends on a number of other things. In my opinion, it depends on three other things:</p>
      <p sl="el">The first is the information that can be given by schools and via the media, as well as at tourist entry points to every town, meaning that the 112 number needs to be advertised in ports, at airports and at railway stations.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second is the question of better cooperation between the 27 Member States of the European Union; we all understand how important it is, especially now, in the summer, at the start of the holidays, for EU citizens to know that, if they call 112, their problem will be resolved regardless of which country they are in and regardless of which language they use on the telephone.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, the most basic point of all is caller location information, so that we can immediately locate where the person with the problem is and help them. This is where technology comes into its own. This is where technology plays a decisive role and this is where the question of the universal service comes into play.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need to know what we are talking about and the citizens listening to us need to know. The universal service – as we all know – is a fundamental bundle of services of a specified standard which can be provided at an affordable price and without distorting competition. This is a concept contained in the directive adopted in 2002, a directive that was revised in 2008, the deadline for the transposition of which expired back in May.</p>
      <p sl="el">Consequently, we have only just entered the evaluation period, which I consider to be extremely important before we progress to the next stage. I say that, because we are talking about this at a time which is absolutely critical to the economy of the European Union and to the economies of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">I really must stress that universal service is not, in my opinion, the only nor the key driver for achieving the ‘broadband for all’ objective, given the very high investment cost, without necessarily being able to provide improved services to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like at this point to quote two figures which are important. Obviously I support the digital agenda and its objectives, but when we see that, even where there is 100% broadband coverage, there is only 50% take-up, we need to ask ourselves why.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I think that introducing a broadband requirement into the universal service should be followed by specific measures and incentives for the private sector, funded from national and Community resources.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the reform of the single market must be completed by ensuring that all European citizens have access to communications. This report presents solutions for effectively tackling this issue. I think that they help promote social inclusion and cross-border investments. This is why the proper implementation of the Universal Services Directive is the key to completing the single market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The single 112 emergency number is one of the European Union’s successful innovations. The public information campaign needs to continue to make this service more effective. I welcome moves to encourage cooperation between the institutions in different Member States responsible for managing emergency situations. I also support the initiative on using interpreters as part of these services, as well as the introduction of the caller location system. Every minute counts in an emergency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the chairman of the committee and also as the shadow for Mrs Rapti, I want to thank her in particular for producing an extremely well-balanced and important report. It is well timed to contribute to the review that the Commission is undertaking. I welcome Mrs Malmström here, looking after Mrs Kroes’ interests, because I know that in Sweden in particular they are very much engaged, as in many countries, in rolling out broadband.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that Mrs Rapti is right in her approach to this, in saying that the current universal service provision is entirely outdated. I should know because I worked on it way back in 1999. That was at the time when mobile phones were in their infancy. We are now in a position where European citizens on average have more than one mobile phone each. So ideas about universal service are being fundamentally changed and recalibrated, but clearly broadband is now moving in as being an entitlement. We have lots of programmes in this area. Governments have already committed to roll out those programmes and are now doing so. We need to make sure that those are effected, but we also need to ensure that the basic principles of universal service are complied with, particularly for people who are disadvantaged and disabled, to enable them to access those services. That is an area where the existing legal conditions need to be properly enforced.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I do not want to repeat what my fellow Members have said, but the real problem with the 112 number is that barely 26% of Europeans know about it, so the Member States, in cooperation with the European Commission, must make the communication strategy a priority.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Improvements must also be made to the procedures for identifying the location of people calling this number, since this is of fundamental importance in determining the chances of saving lives. I also support the idea of a ‘reverse 112 system’, which would use telecommunications services to provide an early-warning system for informing citizens of natural disasters and other kinds of disasters of the sort that are becoming increasingly common in our countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In addition, I unequivocally support the expansion of opportunities for disabled users of telecommunications services, and I naturally welcome the Commission’s pledge to increase the availability of broadband Internet connections for European citizens, including those living outside urban centres.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I also consider this debate to be important. We know how important the universal service is, and that the emergency number 112 should be circulated. As we know, even today less than 30% of the population are aware of this emergency number. That alone shows the need for information and education campaigns, using the various different media, the Internet, radio and broadband. However, I also wish to issue another warning here: all this must not serve to increase social exclusion, because we have to acknowledge that around 100 million people are at risk of poverty and have difficulty in accessing new technology. It is necessary to consider concrete measures and actions which will allow access for all regardless of their circumstances; in other words, the fact that they have no money must not prevent people accessing new technology, the universal service and the emergency number.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to support Mrs Rapti’s draft report proposing a substantially more efficient solution for the universal service and the 112 emergency number. We should, in particular, try to make this service genuinely available across the European Union. Additionally, we should try to ensure that the caller’s location can, if necessary, be pinpointed, in order to provide the caller with medical assistance as quickly as possible, in case of need.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should also aim to prevent misuse of this telephone number as a practical joke or other forms of misuse, so that no one calls the number to report false alarms to switchboards staffed by people working under stress.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also attach great importance to offering communication in numerous languages, because, as people move freely throughout Europe, it is not always possible to communicate to switchboards in one’s own language, and these switchboards should therefore offer at least the basic and most widespread languages used in the European Union. In this context, I would also like to draw attention later to the availability of medical assistance.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, this debate was very interesting and it is important for our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Mr President, one of the problems I find with the European Union is that an awful lot of the good work we do is never actually transmitted to the citizens. It is very easy to get publicity if you want to be negative in the Member States, in the media, etc., but a lot of the good work we do is never reported.</p>
      <p sl="ga">That is partly our own fault. As has been pointed out, if only 26% of citizens are aware of this facility, then you have to ask what are we going to do about it, and whose fault is it. Certainly it is something that is of major importance. Speakers have mentioned people with disabilities but this can add value to the lives of average individual citizens. We should be making an all-out effort to communicate that message to every single citizen so that they can see the positive side of the European Union, which is sadly neglected in these times.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission thinks the 112 emergency number is great!</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Commission and Ms Kroes, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Rapti, on the work that she has done, and also to congratulate the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the work they have done on this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding universal services, I am glad that the Commission and Parliament take very much the same line when it comes to what role the universal service should play in achieving the common objective of broadband coverage. It should provide a safety net to ensure that citizens are not prevented from participating in society through a lack of affordable access to essential telecom services.</p>
      <p sl="en">Universal service is not the only means, nor the key driver, for achieving our ‘Broadband for all’ objectives, and it should take its appropriate, proper place within the range of instruments available to us. Given the potentially significant costs involved in ensuring broadband roll-out across Europe, we need to ensure that the burden of legal obligations does not fall unfairly on the telecom industry or result in increased consumer prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">The flexibility given by the revised telecom rules should be exercised in a coherent manner right across the EU and take appropriate account of conditions on the ground and of the potential impact on the telecoms industry and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is therefore planning to issue a communication, as has been mentioned, on the role of universal service in a broadband environment following the public consultation last year. We have also shown our willingness to help Member States in the implementation process by developing and providing guidance on the application of the existing universal service rules, as called for in the report. We are at the moment in discussion with Member States and the industry on the contents of this guidance. We have also consulted BEREC, which is due to give its opinion very soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, the Commission agrees that the roll-out of 112 services has contributed to better access for European citizens to emergency services, but we need to reap the full benefits of the revised telecom rules, notably on improving access to 112 facilities for disabled users and transmission of precise caller location information.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is committed to supporting the development, standardisation and take-up of advanced emergency communication technologies. It considers that Parliament’s proposals to define key performance indicators for the emergency services could be a good way forward in enhancing common performance standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Obviously, the Commission agrees that the life-saving function of the 112 emergency number cannot be effective if we do not make people truly aware that 112 protects them everywhere in the European Union. That is why the Commission will keep pushing Member States to step up their efforts in promoting 112. Improvements to the 112 system depend heavily on the Member States’ cooperation. The Commission has been actively promoting the exchange of technical expertise and best practice within the Expert Group on Emergency Access, mainly on the implementation of the revised telecom rules on 112 and next-generation emergency access, including standardisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that the Commission will continue to closely cooperate with Member States in order to ensure high and compatible performance on national 112 systems which keep pace with ever-evolving technologies.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The availability of assistance in emergency situations is an integral part of the single market and the freedom rights it provides. The universal 112 emergency number was introduced in Hungary in 2006 with the aim of making emergency services easily available. I can proudly say that the Hungarian Government is committed to adopting fully the 112 emergency number, and pursuant to this the numbers existing today will be phased out gradually from the end of 2012, in the wake of developments financed by EUR 19 million. You may ask why as late as 2012. I think that the technical implementation and making the public aware of the new number cannot be a short-term process. A solid technical foundation is particularly important. In the 21st century Europe needs a single information technology background and functioning data search and geographical positioning systems for emergency services, because the operation of these services without these conditions does not promote, but significantly hinders, the organisation of a unified emergency service. We should therefore welcome the content and objective of this report. The time has come to make citizens aware that they must call 112 in an emergency. We have to continue to call on Member States to do everything they can to help 112 become a completely reliable service available in the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Increased mobility across Europe has also dictated the need for the concept of a single emergency call number, with the specific aim of making the services offered to citizens more efficient. The 112 number, which is part of the obligations assumed by Member States for joining the EU, fulfils this aim, although only 26% of Europeans can identify it as the emergency call number, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey. We therefore see the need to promote the single 112 number more widely so that it does not become redundant in Member States, while stopping the promotion of other national numbers. Due to European citizens’ level of mobility, we must think about handling emergency calls efficiently in foreign languages, as well as about the alternatives to voice calls: text messages, emails or faxes, especially for hearing-impaired users. From a technical perspective, it is vital to reduce the number of failed emergency calls, speed up response times and also reduce the number of hoax calls, which can greatly exceed the number of genuine calls. Coming from Romania, where the 112 number has been operating effectively for several years, I think that it is important for us to support not only the exchange of experiences between the emergency services in Member States, but also joint training programmes for experts and NGOs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Twenty years after it was introduced, 112 is certainly accessible in all Member States, but only 26% of EU citizens know about it. This is an unacceptable state of affairs, which is why I have fought for Parliament to send out a message to the Commission and to Member States. I therefore welcome the vote on Mrs Rapti’s report calling for improvements to service quality and to the information available about this number. More effective regulation is needed, and it is important that we promote the exchange of best practice and ensure that EU funds are properly allocated. It is essential for automated caller location during emergency calls to be faster, and for the future of 112 to be guaranteed by ensuring the reliability of calls made via Skype. We must also introduce the ‘reverse 112’ automated SMS alert system for use in the event of a disaster. As regards universal service, whilst in the long term the plans are to extend the universal broadband service only, I am delighted in particular with the reminder of service providers’ obligation to abide by EU rules on neutrality on the networks. It is unacceptable that their customers might not be able to access the services, content and applications of their choosing over the Internet. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on a more efficient and fairer retail market (2010/2109(INI)) (A7-0217/2011).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, did you know that retail provides almost 20 million jobs and continued to employ throughout the crisis? Our report is about creating more jobs in Europe. The time has come to recognise that retailers are drivers of growth. Did you know, and can you imagine, that if you buy a toy in one Member State for your child, you have to retest it to get additional certification in another Member State? Did you know that you have to repack a cheese to market it on a cross-border basis? What a waste.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our report is about removing borders and barriers to the free movement of goods and services. This is the backbone of European integration and the single market. For the first time we are putting retail on the map of EU policy-making. This has never been done before. I am very grateful to shadows and colleagues who have made a great contribution in making a cross-political commitment to call for an action plan for retail, based on a long-term and holistic approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am really glad that this has been anchored in the new Single Market Act. We are not shying away from controversial issues: unfair commercial practices, private labels, extra fees, to name but a few, as well as tax and trade laws. I know how many colleagues care about people and consumers with reduced mobility or who live in remote and isolated areas or in town centres. We are calling for action on this as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Actually our entire report is a call for action. We are asking Member States to implement and enforce existing internal market legislation and competition law, goods packages, service directives, the Small Business Act and to remove the hidden and hideous new restrictions that have been put up in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">We call on the Commission to take tough measures against breaches of internal market legislation, to crack down on unfair commercial practices, to create a true common European payment area and to remove obstacles, especially for e-commerce. We asked the stakeholders to accept their shared responsibility – with regard to the environment and corporate social responsibility – and to continue to innovate as they are doing. They also have to invest more in skills and competence-building.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am really grateful that colleagues in committee overwhelmingly trusted my line, based on self-regulation. Measures imposed top-down and parachuted will not yield better results or be more efficient than measures that the retailers throughout the supply chain would themselves adopt, share, shape and own. This will require much more commitment from us in public-private partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is my first report. In eight months of consultation it has been a fantastic journey, which has already produced results. We have seen more direct, more intense and more constructive dialogue from people whose relationships used to be solely confrontational. I am very encouraged to see these signs of commitment and shared responsibility from the retail community.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please, colleagues, let us give voluntary initiative a chance. But we also want to see concrete results. The time for denial is over. That is why, in the report, we gave ourselves an instrument to continue to assess progress and keep all parties engaged with the yearly retail round table. This is a living report.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the Vikings to Venice, trade has always been a force of progress, economic development and peace. Let us keep up our commitment to putting the real economy at the centre of the political agenda. We should not give in to the wind of protectionism that is blowing throughout Europe. We should keep our commitment and stand up for a truly border-free Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to speak again this evening both as committee chairman and as the shadow rapporteur for this really important report. I want to congratulate Anna Maria Corazza Bildt on the very ambitious and very courageous way in which she tackled this report. She had a clear vision of what she wanted to achieve and she has carried it through, and she has cooperated effectively with everyone involved. That is crucial, and she does not exaggerate the importance of what the committee has achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">As she said, we have had visits and representations from people in the retail sector whom we had never seen before and who had never engaged with the European Parliament before. And yet, as she emphasises, retailers of all sizes are absolutely at the cutting edge both of the internal market and in delivering for consumers. That is the first point in many cases where consumer protection has to operate. So this is indeed a landmark report, but it is also one that demonstrates the value of the political initiative. We took up an embryo initiative from the Commission, a working document. The Commission had not decided to proceed to any sort of Green Paper. I now hope that they will take it more seriously. I think they will, as I hope Mrs Malmström will confirm later.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, it is a great shame that in this Chamber we now do not have the chance to have a proper debate on really important reports, such as the one we have just heard about from Mrs Rapti and this report from Mrs Corazza Bildt. The procedures of this House need to be changed to allow us to engage with successful rapporteurs and to have really full debates on these issues, instead of these very truncated sessions that we are now forced to live with.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, it is true that the retail trade is under serious attack, particularly in countries where this trade is exercised by micro- and small family businesses, and where in some cases people’s buying power is diminishing. In particular, less urban areas, where they play an important social role, are going through very difficult times. I am speaking from experience, that of my country, Portugal, where this family-based retail trade is currently the target of serious attacks, whether as a result of unequal trading due to unfair competition by the large retail outlets, or difficulties in accessing credit, or people’s low buying power due to increasing poverty and unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, these are the details (which have already been brought up here but which I also wanted to add) to which I believe the Commission should pay greater attention.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I was delighted by what the rapporteur Anna Maria Corazza Bildt said on this important matter.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I am pleased to have an opportunity to say a few words about it.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Coming from Ireland where we are in the middle of a difficult recession – IMF bail-out, etc. – I can see exactly where the problems in relation to retail are. One of the real issues here is the survival of businesses – SMEs – in town centres, etc. which are competing against the big multinationals. While we need regulation I am prepared to go along with self-regulation up to a point, but at the same time we have to ensure that the consumer, the processor, the producer and the retailer are all given fair play, and particularly that consumers can have confidence that they are getting fair value for money. I think what we can do at EU level is to give some kind of coherence to that, and certainly this is a start in that regard.</p>

    <intervention id="1-213-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, the report we are discussing marks an important new step towards recognising the key position that the retail sector occupies in the internal market, as discussed in the Commission’s ‘Retail market monitoring report’ of July 2010. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Corazza Bildt for her excellent work and for this draft report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission also strongly believes that this sector …</p>
      <a text="(The President interrupted the speaker)"/>
      <p sl="fr">requires special attention, as it is a vital element of Europe’s economy. The Commission has demonstrated this belief in its report on monitoring the retail market and through the Single Market Act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is therefore delighted that Parliament is in favour of the general approach proposed in the July 2010 report, which looks not only at economic performance in the retail sector, but also at the direct impact that practices and decisions in this sector have on citizens, consumers, employees, farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), not to mention on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission also recognises the need to coordinate the various policies and initiatives relating to this sector. We are therefore going to examine the possibility of producing a Europe-wide action plan for the retail sector, which would put in place a more explicit, coherent strategy for the sector, whilst at the same time being based on the initiatives already developed by the Commission, such as the High Level Forum for a Better Functioning Food Supply Chain, or the sustainable development initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also welcome all the initiatives proposed in the report that are aimed at improving dialogue between the institutions and the parties involved, such as the ‘Retail Market Roundtable’ to be organised by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have taken note that Parliament wishes certain problems that we identified in our report of July last year to be dealt with as priority areas. Among these, I will mention in particular the continuing, largely unjustified, obstacles to the free movement of goods and services, especially the ongoing difficulties that businesses have in accessing certain markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to mention the growing problems of the accessibility of shops and access to e -commerce faced by consumers, especially the most isolated. In this respect, I would like to highlight Parliament’s concerns over some national rules that may place restrictions on operators from other Member States who try to establish themselves in that country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfair contractual and trade practices between businesses are a matter of concern that both our institutions share. The Commission has begun working on the subject, and within the next few months it plans to adopt a communication, in line with what Parliament is asking for, on the national legal and regulatory frameworks governing unfair business practices, the problems these raise from the EU point of view, and whether or not it would be beneficial to take some action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The final shared concern I would like to mention is the need to encourage sustainable consumption.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, Mr President, the Commission is delighted that the retail sector’s rightful place is being emphasised, considering its economic and social importance and its importance for society as a whole. The Commission will give the issues associated with this sector the full attention they deserve, in close collaboration with the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Charles Goerens, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the future of EU budget support to developing countries (2010/2300(INI)) (A7-0206/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-217-000" speaker_id="840" name="Charles GOERENS" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Luxembourg" birth_date="06-02-1952" birth_place="Ettelbruck" m_state="LU">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will say straight away that there are no miracle solutions to the problems that go with insecurity and poverty. One only has to look back over the different types of relationship we had with developing countries over the 20th century.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can put behind us for good the colonial era, which was marked by the appropriation of entire continents by the old European colonial powers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The next, postcolonial stage, which was characterised by a somewhat paternalistic approach, produced results that although perhaps not insignificant, were nonetheless highly unsatisfactory compared with the southern countries’ considerable needs, especially in the areas of health, education and basic economic development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Over the last few decades, a policy of cooperation, based on a set of values including human rights, respect for minorities, upholding democratic principles and the rule of law has gradually become the norm.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This policy, which the European Union claims to its credit, focuses more on treating our partner countries as being in charge of their own development, hence the notions of partnership, political dialogue, and above all, ownership by the partner countries of their own development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, the phrase ‘budget support’ is in keeping with the latter kind of relationship. ‘Budget support’ refers to the transfer of financial resources from a funding agency outside the partner country’s treasury, under the proviso that the country abide by the agreed conditions governing payments. At first sight, budget support may seem to be a risky undertaking. However, this is not true when the necessary precautions are taken to ensure that the funds are used wisely. All disbursements – and I must stress this point – are made on the premise that the recipient country has the necessary capacity to manage the funds. This means that the country must first have in place a strategy to combat poverty that addresses the basic needs of the inhabitants in question. This is also known as endogenous development, and is the only real form of lasting development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission, moreover, is very aware of the conditions that the recipient countries must meet, and has ensured that a fail-safe system is in place to prevent funds from being diverted in developing countries. As for the countries themselves, there is every reason for them to build up their capacity to engage with local communities, and with their parliaments of course, first and foremost.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another benefit that is worth mentioning is that better control of public finances by the beneficiaries of budget support can also have a healthy effect on their taxation systems’ capacity to bring in additional revenue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nonetheless, budget support is not a cure-all, nor is it a funding instrument that all countries are able to make use of: far from it, in fact. One of the consequences of the strict conditions imposed is that they rule out a large number of developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to end my speech by adding that I urge everyone to adopt my proposed amendment to paragraph 1. If it is not adopted, I will have to vote against my own report, as the statements that second-guess the Commission’s intentions are purely gratuitous and not at all justified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has been confirmed to me during our consultations, the Commission has taken all the necessary steps to ensure that the disbursements fulfil the precautionary conditions to which I just referred.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, I would like to say that paragraph 11 goes a little too far. It aims to promote budget support as basically the only form of development cooperation. This is going too far. It is not in keeping with the realistic outlook that the Commission has maintained throughout these discussions.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, this report contains substantial arguments in favour of increasing budgetary support forms of development aid, instead of the traditional project-based approach. It would also be a good idea for both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to cooperate with the Commission on the establishment of independent indicators to assess how effectively financial support funded by European taxpayers is being used. In view of the fact that some countries, such as Rwanda or Uganda, have demonstrated their ability to manage public finances better than others, it would be a good idea for the governments and parliaments in countries receiving development aid to share this positive experience, and to cooperate in the establishment of the assessment indicators. In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the high quality and broad scope of the two reports, both that of Mr Goerens and the following report of Mr Kaczmarek. I would also like to comment on this report later.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, budget support is currently one of the most important forms of aid. We are at a crucial moment, since the Commission is committed to increasing the funds destined for budget support over coming years.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that budget support is compatible with other forms of aid, as long as there is long-term commitment and better coordination between donors, and simplification of procedures.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission should adopt a dynamic approach towards the criteria on admissibility, and the results indicators should be established on the basis of poverty reduction objectives being met.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that budget support should prioritise those programmes with the greatest impact on poverty reduction, and this is why we feel that the health and education ministries are of fundamental importance. In the same way, the gender perspective must also be incorporated into budget support.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another of the areas of potential highlighted in the report is that budget support helps to strengthen public management systems, and the audit and control capacity of developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, Mr President, I believe that the national parliaments, and the local and non-state authorities in developing countries should be informed and be able to make suggestions throughout all the phases of budget support.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I take a very sceptical view of direct budget support, because I believe that it can encourage the trade in weapons, for example. Something that I would like to draw people’s attention to is the notion that there should be tighter scrutiny of the EU’s budget as a whole, but also of aid and this budget support, and these processes should be more transparent, so that people know what their money is being spent on.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It would be interesting to know if the Commission has thought about whether every month on the Internet there should be information available to the public concerning the results achieved by the financial assistance which the EU provides. I believe that it would help people to be more vigilant and more obliging, because they would know that their money is reaching its destination. Now, unfortunately, it does not all get to where it is supposed to, by any means: it is subject to abuse and corruption, and it is used to buy arms. I would propose that each month the EU starts to post on the Internet the results of what has been achieved through development aid.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, there is an essential starting point in this debate which some among us at times forget or attempt to hide. For decades, centuries, relations between the so-called industrialised countries and what are termed developing countries have been founded upon unequal trade and upon the dependency and underdevelopment of the latter, which are looked on as sources of supply for raw materials and cheap labour.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Centre-periphery relations, peculiar to the capitalist system currently in force at a global scale, are intrinsically unjust and unequal. These relations are upheld by the policies imposed by institutions such as the World Trade Organisation or the International Monetary Fund, with their programmes of structural adjustment, and by means of instruments such as the suffocating external debt and its servicing. It is all this that should be questioned and profoundly changed, and because of all this the policy of development aid should not be looked upon as an act of charity by the richest towards the poorest, but instead as a necessity dictated by the criteria of fundamental justice. The report, which contains positive aspects, but which is not free from contradiction, does not, unfortunately, address these and other essential questions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I think that the budget support granted to developing countries is more effective than project-based funding. It helps reduce the costs relating to projects and their fragmented operation. Another benefit is that contributions can be adapted to each country’s specific requirements based on an ongoing dialogue between donors and beneficiaries. I should stress how important the transparency of this process is. In this respect, it is vital to have the active involvement of the European Commission, local civil society and national parliaments. The principle of shared ownership of the funds’ implementation is also a crucial factor contributing to their effectiveness.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his great report. I very much agree that budget support is a very important instrument. It does not help with everything, but it has the potential to increase country ownership and enhance parliamentary control and oversight by civil society, and it can contribute to accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course it only works if, at the same time, you strengthen civil society organisations, parliaments and courts of auditors. In the end it does not mean that we should engage less if we just give money to a country, it actually means engaging more, in policy dialogue, etc. But we cannot expect a development which took Europe decades, if not millennia, to happen within a month. You cannot confuse defectiveness with something that you can see in a weekly update reporting that this or that has happened. Education or health sectors, for example, do not spring up within a week or two. For proper, sustainable growth and development we actually need more time; we need to take a longer view.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I realise that providing budget support to developing countries is an important contribution that can help improve the financial capacity of public spending in such countries. As there is a lack of government accountability in many countries for the handling of these funds, however, it is very important for us to consider sensitively whether a particular country is truly capable of managing our budget aid effectively and responsibly. I therefore view the efforts of Mr Goerens to clarify the rules on European budget aid as a meaningful attempt towards the more efficient and more rational management of EU funds, and an attempt that is worthy, in my personal opinion, of our broad support.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, EU budget support for developing countries is exceptionally important. We should examine the negative as well as the positive effects of such support. Without doubt, it has a direct effect on the development of economic potential. Nevertheless, we must not forget the possible risks involved with budget support. These could include difficulties in monitoring countries outside the EU and possible irregularities involved in distributing and utilising the funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I do believe that this support is very important and should be continued. This is also in the indirect interests of the European Union. It results in much more rapid economic growth in those countries we support and so contributes to improvements in their economic situation, which through trade also has a positive effect on Member States and their markets. The allocated funding facilitates the stabilisation of internal situations in trouble spots and a significant reduction in poverty indicators. This aid is important. However, we must try to introduce controls for EU funding and monitor it more efficiently so that it truly supports the building of economies, and is not earmarked for undesirable aims.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, in general, I am in favour of this budgetary support for developing countries, but to be honest I am somewhat doubtful about its effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The idea of budgetary support for developing countries goes back to the Marshall Plan and is seen as perhaps the most effective way of implementing the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda. Indeed, the European Union spent EUR 13 billion on this from 2003 to 2009.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Obviously, some good has come of it. But I am just wondering how effective it really is and, particularly, how we can justify that type of expenditure, because it is difficult to assess the effect in terms of the twin objectives of poverty reduction and the strengthening of democracy in the countries that are recipients of this aid. I would like an objective view. There are different views but certainly an objective view would be welcome.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I have asked to speak again because some speakers have said that the report is not detailed enough. I would ask them to re-read the written report, which sets out all the conditions. They are even stricter than the conditions that had been called for.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I refer in particular to paragraph 32, which mentions the fact that the Commission systematically bases its approach on results derived from performance indicators; or paragraph 33, which mentions strategic decisions, or paragraph 34, which draws attention to the fact that many countries are excluded from budget support because of certain major shortcomings and lack of capacity, and weak governance in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everyone who has criticised the report ought to bear in mind that budget support is not within every country’s reach. The countries must abide by extremely strict conditions, and very few hiccups are found to occur, as the report by the European Court of Auditors confirms. I must stress the fact that the International Monetary Fund is involved in every decision, and that, moreover, the Commission seeks approval from the IMF before making any disbursements in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not think we could be any stricter. In spite of everything that is done in this area, I should point out that the unexpected can always happen. However, Mr President, let us not be hypocritical: this happens in our own countries also, and within the European Union. Are we in a position to preach to the rest of the world? Are we in a position to say that non-compliant …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Goerens for this very valuable contribution to the important debate on budget support. We welcome it because it invites the Commission to continue our efforts to improve the design and the approach of budget support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Goerens, the proposals that you raise come at a time when we are busy preparing the new communication on EU budget support. It is scheduled for adoption by mid-October. In this regard it is becoming apparent that your report – Parliament’s report – and the emerging ideas of the new communication are moving in similar directions.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of the new budget support policy, the Commission will develop a closer link between general budget support and the fundamental values of the European Union. This is particularly important when it comes to political governance. Issues like human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the eligibility criteria covering macroeconomic public financial management and the national or sector strategy in the partner country will be assessed in a much more structured and rigorous way, as you also pointed out in your speech just now and in your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Jäätteenmäki, the Commission will strengthen accountability and transparency in order to make development processes much more inclusive. The role of parliaments, civil society organisations and audit institutions in partner countries will be further strengthened as part of a budget support operation. The external oversight of national budgets is crucial for domestic accountability and international acceptance. In addition the Commission will strengthen its risk assessment and management framework with regard to budget support in line with the recommendations of the recent Court of Auditors report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we would also like to make a reference to the Court of Auditors report on budget support operations from 2010. The Court there acknowledged that the Commission has made considerable progress but noted that there are still weaknesses in the methodology and the management that can prevent budget support from reaching its full potential. With this statement and backed by Council conclusions, I would like to contest the statement in paragraph 1 of the report that there have been numerous types of undesirable development and wastage of money. However, it is precisely because there are still improvements to be made that the Commission will come with a communication in mid-October. Mr Goerens, your report will be very helpful in that regard.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the fruitful help they have given me in drafting this report. I would also like to extend the same comments to the other Members, fellow Members from the Parliamentary committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">Sixty years ago, the European Coal and Steel Community was created, and there is no better way of commemorating this event now than by discussing energy infrastructures in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, the objectives of the European Union’s policy are clear – the common European internal market, the drive for renewable energy as a means of or instrument for fighting against climate change, security of energy supply and diversification of energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the Treaty of Lisbon, one title, Title XXI, is devoted to energy, and it sets out the commitments that I have just mentioned, as well as endorsing the interconnection of energy grids. Well, the goal of the report we have drafted is to improve those energy infrastructures that, in the opinion of the European Commission, are outdated and poorly interconnected. For example, the generation of wind energy in the North Sea and Baltic Sea is increasing spectacularly, and with the immense renewable energy potential in southern Europe and North Africa we find ourselves up against problems relating to large-scale electricity storage and the recharging needs of electric vehicles, as well as many other urgent issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is impossible to tackle all of this if we do not design new grids and new connections, both within the European Union and in third countries. This is why in coming years we will have to make progress in determining the infrastructure we need: a) establishing the criteria that will make it possible to select projects that are of interest to Europe; b) eliminating ‘energy islands’; c) ensuring that these projects are carried out within reasonable timescales, and mediating to find ways of resolving the conflict-ridden subject of authorisation and permit procedures in the Member States; and d) ensuring funding that will attract and stimulate private investment, without prejudice to whatever public support may be necessary.</p>
      <p sl="es">Energy efficiency and saving, as well as smart grids, are pivotal ingredients in the new kind of design contained in the report, because we believe that by reducing energy demand we can reduce our dependency on imports, which will have a knock-on effect on our infrastructure requirements.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fundamental concern of this report from the very outset has been the processing of permits and authorisations to enable the required work to be carried out. At the moment, projects drag on endlessly. This happens due to people’s opposition to seeing turbines or other kinds of facilities springing up in their neighbourhoods. We feel that this conflict could be solved by providing early public information and setting up a warning system for cases in which a country’s authorities do not deal with an application within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are up against ambitious objectives, and this calls for everyone to be involved. In this regard, the industry companies, who are rightly calling out for a stable regulatory framework as the best way of assuring financing for their efforts, are of fundamental importance.</p>
      <p sl="es">Until now, the European Union’s energy policy, both outside and within its borders, has lacked any decisively European impetus. Europe must speak with one voice, which must be clearly audible and ring out loudly in the vaults of the European building, because it is our very energy fragility that must give us the strength to build a Europe that is solid and vigorous in terms of energy, and a worthy successor, in this anniversary year, to the great invention of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was our very origin.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, we are all used to making choices. We make choices when we buy soap or televisions, and when we select which mobile-telephone operator to use. As consumers, our ability to make these choices gives us the lowest prices possible, because that is competition. However, there is one field in which we in Europe are very often deprived of this competition, these choices. That is energy – electricity and gas. Why do many consumers not have the ability to make these choices? The reason is that in Europe, we lack the infrastructure and the interconnections to allow for the existence of such a market in which consumers can make a choice.</p>
      <p sl="lv">With this report the European Parliament clearly declares that European residents and consumers must be able to exercise a choice not only between soaps, but also of energy in the electricity and gas market. By creating this infrastructure, we shall give consumers choices and the lowest prices possible. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the upgrading and renewal of energy infrastructure are essential factors for achieving the targets of sustainable and intelligent growth which we are seeking with the Europe 2020 strategy, and for the energy security we need.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is imperative that all regions are involved in this challenge. In order for this to happen, the incentives established in the regulatory systems must be improved, specifically those which apply to higher-risk projects and more innovative projects, such as those which are being developed in the Azores in the field of renewable energy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The regions must be involved in the design and implementation phases of projects, in the definition of priorities and in project development and execution, because this will guarantee better results and, thus, a better defence of European interests. The current economic situation accentuates even more the need to adopt an innovative and integrated approach to energy issues in order that all economic, environmental and social aspects may be taken into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon offers a specific legal basis for the development of the European Union’s energy policy, which must be used appropriately for the modernisation, improved interconnection and adjustment of the Union’s energy infrastructure with a view to achieving the energy and climate objectives for 2020.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my view, security of supply and the strengthening of solidarity between Member States in the field of energy can be achieved through cohesion policy. In particular, European territorial cooperation provides new opportunities for cross-border cooperation, facilitating, for example, interconnections between local and regional energy sources and large energy networks. The coordination of energy infrastructure projects at local, regional and European level is essential in order to ensure the proper interconnection of networks and to maximise the efficiency of funding, regardless of whether it has come from regional or European sources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the importance of developing energy production and setting priorities for energy infrastructures for 2020 or beyond cannot be emphasised strongly enough. However, as energy is a strategic area which demands high investment, those regions and countries with more fragile economies find it difficult to keep up with innovations, and therefore complete liberalisation in this matter could lead to greater social inequality, greater asymmetry and greater energy poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, three measures are required that seem essential to us: maintaining public policies in the field of energy, with the precise objective of ensuring access for all regardless of their circumstances; maintaining strong public companies and public sectors, which will also allow regions and countries with difficulties to innovate, expand and receive support; and ensuring that all people have access to energy, preventing energy poverty and the difficulty of millions of families in accessing energy and heating for their houses.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, firstly may I commend the rapporteur for the excellent speech he gave on energy and what we have to do between now and 2020.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The rapporteur used a phrase which is very important. He said ‘the European interest’. It is about time we started thinking about the European interest, not the Member States’ interest, not the global interest, but the European interest.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The sooner we become self-sufficient in terms of energy, the better we will be able to contribute to the entire world. Certainly we need a Europe-wide grid, not in 2050, but as soon as possible. We need renewable energy – wind, wave, tidal, bio, solar. All of these are within our remit. We have to develop these. Also if we have fossil fuels within Europe, let us develop them. The sooner we wean ourselves off fossil fuels coming from other regimes, the stronger we will be in Europe and the greater chance we will have of creating a sense of Europe – one voice, one Europe – and then we will be able to convert the world.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Parliament has already adopted a European Union energy policy concept. Numerous approved measures setting out European energy interconnection routes are likely to be implemented even after 2020. Nevertheless, it may certainly be a useful exercise to look at the more distant future of the European Union’s energy infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="sk">New technologies and new types of energy sources also place new demands on energy distribution, and the current networks are not always able to transmit new types of energy. In this context, a qualified, expert view of EU energy infrastructure technology beyond 2020 may provide a useful basis for the policymaking of European institutions, as it will help in the forecasting of the financial capacity needed to secure the energy potential for the European Union’s economic growth, especially in the future. From this perspective, in my opinion, this could be an interesting concept.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes this own-initiative report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond. It is a topic that is of course very high on the agenda and I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their commitment and constructive cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Energy networks are at the heart of our energy system. Without secure intelligence and sustainable energy networks we cannot meet our climate goals and our energy targets in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within the next decades our energy system will therefore need to go through a deep transformation process that will bring huge challenges but also opportunities in the way we generate, transport, distribute and consume energy. In almost any possible future scenario, energy infrastructures will play the key role as a catalyst enabling us to meet our emission reduction objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, as the European Council in February confirmed, they will also be crucial in ensuring that solidarity between Member States becomes operational, that alternative supply routes materialise and that renewables will develop.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new EU energy infrastructure policy is needed to change the way in which networks are planned and developed in the European Union. This is why the European Parliament’s own-initiative report on energy infrastructure is so timely and important.</p>
      <p sl="en">In November last year the Commission adopted a communication outlining our vision for such a new policy, the strategies and priorities to be pursued, and I would like to recall here what is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to build grids connecting the huge offshore wind energy potential in the northern seas to consumption centres in northern and central Europe. We need to diversify our gas supplies, sources, counterparts and routes with the construction of the southern corridor. We need to develop interconnections in south-western Europe with a view to integrating renewable energies and increasing the flexibility of gas flows in the region. We need to fully integrate the Baltic electricity and gas market into the European market, thus ending the isolation of energy islands, and we need to strengthen the regional network in central-eastern and south-eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need now to move from priorities to concrete projects of European interest, from plans on drawing boards to consultation, permit granting, financing and construction on the ground, and that is why our forthcoming legislative proposal on energy infrastructure will be so important.</p>
      <p sl="en">An essential element when implementing infrastructure policies is ensuring financing. It is estimated that over EUR 200 billion are needed in the coming years, and not all this investment will just happen by itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, as you know, the Commission adopted our proposal for the next multiannual framework; it provides for EUR 9.1 billion to be dedicated to energy infrastructures for the period 2014-2020 as part of a common infrastructure fund. This acknowledges the need for specific EU funding for energy infrastructures in order to deliver on our common energy and climate targets but also to ensure continued and secure supply of competitive energy to all European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission warmly welcomes the European Parliament’s support for a fund such as outlined in your resolution on the MFF. The Commission also appreciates the recommendations, including in the report discussed today, regarding the prioritisation of energy infrastructure projects, the acceleration of permit-granting procedures and better involvement of interested stakeholders as well as the regulation of cross-border infrastructure and financing.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will take all this into due consideration in the process of developing the forthcoming legislative proposal for a regulation on energy infrastructure development, which is scheduled for the autumn of this year. We look forward to cooperating with the Parliament on this new proposal and to your support in the efforts to develop the grids Europe needs for 2020 and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European energy and climate strategy must combine a competitive economy with the security of energy supply and environmental concerns. In order to attain the proposed objectives, strong investment in energy infrastructures is fundamental. I welcome the proposal to set up a European connection mechanism contained in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2022 adopted by the European Commission. The Connecting Europe Facility aims to expedite the development of infrastructure in the fields of energy, transport and information and communication technology with a budget of EUR 40 billion for the 2014-2020 period. I would draw particular attention to this mechanism in terms of its support for the islands and outermost regions, such as the Canary Islands, Madeira, the Azores and the French overseas departments, whose specific requirements in terms of energy infrastructure must be taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Infrastructure priorities should promote the creation of optimal energy networks within the EU common market. The report focuses on the principles which are to be retained, such as the environment and combating climate change, effective transmission and energy saving, competition and solidarity, security of supply, funding, cooperation between agencies and a 10-year planning period. On this basis, market forces are supposed to create a common market infrastructure themselves, in agreement with Member States. I do not believe this can lead to optimal solutions. What we need is a vision and a project agreed with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have several things to say about the report. First of all, in paragraph 5 the rapporteur warns against the development of an infrastructure between the EU and third countries, because this could increase the risk of leakage of CO2 emissions. I do not agree. European networks must be ready to receive energy from external sources and to export it. Interference by the Commission in this matter is not compatible with the principles of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, European infrastructure should take into account the existence of time zones and also climate zones.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, the transmission of wind energy from north to south requires special new networks, not only from the North Sea but also from the Baltic.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The main challenge in the energy industry will be to guarantee affordable, safe and sustainable energy for all EU citizens. However, we cannot expect significant success as long as we do not have an efficient and sufficiently flexible energy infrastructure. I agree with the notion that the EU has to treat diversification as a priority.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As is emphasised in the report, the density of energy transport networks is inadequate in South-East Europe. It is a European interest to decrease the unilateral exposure of the area by providing alternative supply and transit routes, to increase market liquidity and to facilitate appropriate competition between different energy sources. In the light of this, I see it as a great improvement that the report identifies the criteria to be observed by priority investments if they expect EU assistance. These criteria include diversification of transit routes and resources, the increase in market integration and liquidity, the elimination of energy islands and network integration of renewable energy. I agree that in addition to purely economic indicators, the assessment must also take into consideration socio-economic factors. Finally, I would like to touch upon financial resources. The Commission estimates that energy transport alone requires an investment of EUR 200 billion by 2020. As EU sources are only expected to cover a fraction of the total financing requirements, it is of paramount importance to create a stable regulatory environment and new, innovative financing instruments with a view to prompting the private sector to invest in this field.</p>

Integrated and secure energy networks are a key requirement not only for the aims of EU energy policy, but also for its economic strategy. The EU needs a fully functioning internal market in this area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In accordance with the report’s provisions, the construction of an internal energy market should be completed by 2015, which will ensure the free movement of gas and electricity between the countries of the EU, and also connect energy islands to the infrastructure. In view of the growing demand for imported fuels, the EU is creating a common energy policy to avoid future crises similar to those which took place last year. New transmission routes and interconnectors between countries, and the search for alternative fuels, sources and supply routes are to form the basis of energy safety and solidarity between its members.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Poland forms an important part of this system, but its energy infrastructure is in a state of gradual decay. Polish power stations and transmission and distribution networks are suffering from a lack of funding of over 70%. In Poland, where the economy is based on coal, it has been possible to exploit native fossil fuel resources, such as, for example, coal, and also shale gas. In Poland, over 90% of electricity is generated from coal. Mines are profitable, which is the exception in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Guaranteeing energy security for the EU Member States is one of the most important challenges facing the EU. For many years we have been debating the prospects for solving this problem. Meanwhile, the main objective, namely independence from Russian exports, has still not been achieved. In order to change this state of affairs, the EU needs considerable investment in energy infrastructure. The construction of new transmission networks is essential. Our priority must be the construction of the Nabucco pipeline and the North-South pipeline. Implementing these ventures will gain us independence from Russian blockades and energy blackmail. At the same time, it will contribute to a lowering in gas prices and will strengthen competition in national economies. The construction of these routes will also be an expression of European solidarity in the field of energy, which is very necessary in the recent difficult period the EU has been experiencing. Another immensely important aspect contributing to the independence of Europe in the energy field is the creation of the so-called Polish section of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline. Its construction would allow the transfer of Caucasian oil to Central and Eastern Europe. At the same time, there would be an increase in competition and a reduction in price. This investment is also included in the objectives of the Eastern Partnership in the field of common energy initiatives. Also, the report as a whole does not pay sufficient attention to financial support for the construction of further hydrocarbon storage. Construction is essential to extend the safety period to a minimum of 120 days.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It matters a lot to us how our energy policy and infrastructure are shaped in the future. It is conspicuous that there is increasing competition between Member States concerning energy policy. This is why we need to develop and modernise our infrastructure constantly. We must try to keep national fragmentation to a minimum. We need to pay particular attention to the Member States which are dependent on a single provider.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would like to highlight here the vulnerability of Central European countries where gas supply is concerned. We need to take this into consideration in future infrastructure development so that we can eliminate it to some extent. We can see positive results in the North-South connection as well, which is a definite improvement. We must build networks that operate efficiently, while taking into account in particular solidarity between Member States. The issues of economic prudence and energy efficiency are of key importance as well. The EU is especially dependent on a few energy sources, which is why we have to manage our existing resources wisely. I think that it is very important for Europe to create a common market, and this report will assist us in this. It is unfortunate, however, that the report does not deal with the gas infrastructure in depth. The issue of regional cooperation must be emphasised more. Annex IV to the report by Mr Vidal Quadras, already adopted in the voting for the security of gas supply, may help us in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the current portfolio of energy-generating sources needs to be changed by focusing on a number of renewable energy sources. This is why I am calling on Member States to adapt their infrastructure to the energy mix required to meet the targets set by the EU for renewable energy sources, cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and promoting energy efficiency. Considerable investment needs to be made in the energy infrastructure to achieve this target by 2050 (roughly EUR 200 billion). Failure to make this investment would entail the following: a much higher cost in terms of environmental deterioration and an increase in energy prices and in energy insecurity and dependency. Significant risks are associated with the energy infrastructure: operational (for example, congestion and discontinuity of supply), natural (for example, earthquakes and floods), environmental (for example, pollution, and habitat and biodiversity loss) and anthropogenic/political (for example, risks associated with security and terrorism). Member States should map the risks as a tool for making decisions and monitoring the results from creating and improving smart, interconnected grids. Modernising national energy grids and interconnecting them in a super smart grid could provide a stable, secure flow of affordable energy for the public and create a number of green jobs.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The Commission Communication published in November 2010, ‘Energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond’, addresses the main challenges facing the EU’s electricity and gas infrastructure, which will help achieve a single energy market and a high level of energy supply security. The obsolete TEN-E instrument obviously needs to be replaced with new legislation on energy security and infrastructure, which should produce solutions for the necessary funding as well. More than EUR 200 billion are required by 2020 for gas pipelines and electricity grids alone. The report from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is aimed in particular at presenting the European Parliament’s position regarding the expected new legislative proposal. First of all, it confirms the four priority corridors for electricity and the three corridors for the gas sector, while also suggesting a way to make the most of the limited financial resources. This is done mainly through clear rules for acquiring the status of a ‘project of European interest’ for which even public funding can be obtained. I welcome the detailed criteria drawn up for projects with European aspects, which will help increase the level of market integration, eliminate shortcomings in interconnections and end dependence on a single supplier. ‘More Europe’ in the energy sector means more solidarity in Europe and more benefits for citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Energy security has recently become a fashionable and popular buzzword repeated in all institutions of the EU. It means not only access to the raw materials for producing energy, but also a functioning infrastructure for transmission and distribution. The Treaty of Lisbon has only recently indicated a need for building energy solidarity in Europe in this field. This should be exploited and long-term, strategic plans for infrastructure should be put in place. In particular, we need to increase the capacity of energy links between EU Member States and to build alternative, strategic routes. Interconnectors should form a key part of the energy puzzle. They allow free transfer of hydrocarbons between Member States. They are protected against the threat of energy blockades by exporting countries and they make energy price stability possible. That is why it is extremely important for the EU to provide financial support for the construction of this type of project. Investment in energy security is also a commitment to the development of new technologies. They make it possible to reduce intervention in the natural environment and enable better exploitation of conventional energy sources, such as coal. This is also why, in spite of a restrictive climate policy, the EU should actively promote carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, especially those in countries where coal forms a significant part of energy production.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report is about the future of universal social services and proposes pragmatic ideas for advancing the quality of those services, and decent working conditions for those who deliver them.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is based on widespread consultation with civil society, with the social partners, and with local and regional authorities, and on detailed political compromises consolidating 285 amendments to the report. It is my objective to try to maintain the integrity of those compromises in the vote tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">A high-level stakeholders’ working group is proposed. For me this is the most important aspect of the report. We can differ here on matters of principle and on matters of law but the proposed working group provides us with an ongoing method to arrive at implementable solutions. I also propose a fourth Forum on Services of General Interest to monitor progress of the working group and other initiatives such as the European Voluntary Quality Framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">Research consistently proves that social services, and public services more generally, are not only socially invaluable, but are also economically vital. Public services contribute 26% of our GDP and employ 64 million people, one third of whom are employed in the health and social services, while Eurofound research shows that public services are one of the most important ways of enhancing the citizens’ quality of life, ensuring full inclusion in society and providing for social and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report as it stands outlines reforms to address the problems and legal uncertainties that providers and users have identified as needing urgent solutions, such as the difficulties arising from current procurement and state aid rules. It also proposes an active role for social economy enterprises and actors, urges that a race to the bottom be prevented through compliance by contractors and sub-contractors with Member States’ social, environmental, and quality criteria, and looks for an EU statute on mutual societies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The world has changed dramatically since 2007, the last occasion on which social services were addressed in this Parliament. The ‘light regulation’ economic model, assiduously promoted by the Commission and the Council over many years, spectacularly collapsed at the end of that year. That collapse has had enormous human, social and economic costs. Some Member States’ debt and budget deficits have reached crisis levels as a consequence of the nationalisation of privately owned bank debt, resulting in vicious austerity programmes which are hitting the vulnerable hardest.</p>
      <p sl="en">The pressures generated by this situation are putting massive strain on the funding of social services, and the report calls for enhanced EU programmes and for project bonds to help address those problems. Because of the economic and unemployment crisis our citizens face, they have a greater need than ever for access to high quality social services, while our economies and our societies also need the added value which such services can deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that this report can be adopted in full tomorrow and look forward to working with all the stakeholders to ensure that our citizens get the services they deserve. To conclude I want to thank everybody who worked with me on this report – the shadows, the staff, those in civil society – who took part and indeed brought forward many innovative ideas which I hope the working group will be in a position to develop over the time to come.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the report which we are debating is of particular importance, bearing in mind the influence that social services of general interest have on the daily life of European citizens, as well as on social cohesion, job creation and economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The collaboration with the rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, was very beneficial and enlightening, as the rapporteur himself has just stated, and enabled several compromises to be adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I congratulate the rapporteur on the result that we have today, which we are debating.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In truth, for our part, the main concern was to make it clear that competence in this area falls to the Member States. The national authorities hold the power to define, organise and finance social services of general interest. It is therefore unnecessary to create harmonising legislation on a European level, given that the realities of these social services of general interest are very diverse in the 27 Member States. It is enough to look at the health, social security, employment and social housing services, which are examples of the fact that closeness and knowledge of contexts are the cornerstones for the appropriate and fairest provision of these services.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the cross-cutting social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon place a binding obligation on States to protect social rights and the right of access to services of general interest in particular. It is time we proved to Europe’s citizens that social Europe works.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must therefore give our body of social legislation its rightful place in EU law, by acknowledging the specific nature of social services of general interest where competition rules are concerned, bearing in mind that these services are strongly linked to local communities and rely on parties involved in the social economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr De Rossa’s report is an opportunity to affirm principles that are simple and at the same strongly rooted in common sense, equality and universal access to these collectively run services, which contribute to social well-being and progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you said: ‘The time has come to put ideas into practice.’ The time has come indeed, which is why I propose that in this debate you should provide real support for a European legislative instrument for public social services.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is right that this European Parliament asserts itself – specifically protecting in this resolution both health and housing – so that the European Court does not sneak European competition policy into the provision of public services on our continent.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the recognition in the resolution that the social rights of users and of staff override those of competition, and also our call to protect public services in our countries against disproportionate cuts at this time of economic austerity. Local government in particular will welcome our statement that the most appropriate form of delivery for social services is public and voluntary sector provision, including in-house. They will welcome the fact that tendering is only one form of selecting a provider and that, if tendering is used, there should be no automatic bias towards the lowest cost above everything else. Mutuals and cooperatives will welcome our recognition for the social economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The public service ethic is brought into European decision-making through this resolution. I join with others in congratulating our rapporteur and I hope the Commission will respect the principles of our vote when we take that vote tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising the importance of all public services, including social services of general interest, without which there is no social Europe or social inclusion. We would, therefore, stress the need to change liberalisation policies in order to promote a true policy of social progress that guarantees universal access to quality public services, naturally paying special attention to underprivileged groups but ensuring that all have access to these general interest services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore believe that liberalisation should be stopped and that we should carry out an urgent assessment of the consequences of liberalisation, both socially and on people’s lives, in sectors that are fundamental to social progress such as the areas of transport, energy, water, postal services, telecommunications, health, education and social protection. This, Commissioner, is the challenge that we are throwing down.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development on the future of social services of general interest (SSGIs), I would like to congratulate Mr De Rossa and emphasise the fact that we are dealing with an essential pillar of the social market economic model which we advocate for Europe, in which SSGIs play a fundamental role in promoting cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For social cohesion in the European Union, it is advisable not to disregard the existence of minimum protection levels in all Member States, without prejudice to respect for the powers of their national, regional and local authorities. The European regions play a very important role in the provision of these services to the people and their opinions must be taken into consideration, given the very nature of the constraints they are under in guaranteeing this provision.</p>
      <p sl="pt">At such a time of crisis as we are living through at the moment, social services of general interest constitute a network of social protection for the most disadvantaged, or for those whose income does not allow them access to private services. It is therefore important to guarantee that Member States that decentralise powers ensure that they are accompanied by the respective financial means in order that the regional and local authorities can ensure that the services are properly dispensed to the people.</p>

    <intervention id="1-256-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Cecilia Malmström" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have followed with great interest the debate in the Parliament on social services of general interest. We fully share the rapporteur’s view of the social services. We agree that the social services play an important role in terms of helping people throughout their lives and enhancing their capacity to participate in society and enjoy their fundamental rights. So the Commission agrees with the rapporteur and the House that it is vital to guarantee universal access to high-quality, accessible, affordable social services.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed by public authorities and service providers on the application of EU rules to social services. However, we would like to stress that EU state aid and internal market rules can help public authorities to organise and finance good quality, cost-efficient services. In addition, we believe that some of the difficulties encountered by stakeholders are due to a lack of awareness and information about how EU rules are applied. As a result, the Commission has put in place various tools over the last four years to provide more information and clarification to stakeholders, and we will of course continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is also in the process of revisiting EU state aid and public procurement rules. In the state aid field, the Commission will ensure that the rules take due account of the specificities of the social services sector and are proportionate to the – often limited – competition distortions in this area. This initiative will be part of a more differentiated approach to state aid for public services announced by the Commission in March.</p>
      <p sl="en">On public procurement, the Commission’s Green Paper has launched an EU-wide debate on how to increase flexibility and clarify existing rules while, at the same time, guaranteeing high-quality services. I am sure that substantial progress can be achieved in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to comment on an idea which was discussed in the Third Forum on Social Services of General Interest, namely the establishment of a high-level working group involving a wide range of stakeholders: Parliament, Commission, Council, Committee of Regions, social partners and civil society organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is, of course, always open to dialogue on the application of EU rules to social services, as the recent public consultation has shown. At the same time we need, of course, to ensure that such a dialogue respects the role of the various institutions as defined by the Treaties and leads to concrete results. We consider, therefore, that it would be more suitable and effective to build on existing structures; the Commission is ready to discuss in more detail how such a dialogue could be organised.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Today’s Europe is experiencing a truly difficult social reality as a consequence of the crisis. In this context, the activity of social services becomes more important, just as it becomes necessary to strengthen the social component of the European integration process. Greater legal certainty must be guaranteed for social stakeholders and public authorities, financial transparency in this sector must be assured, and the quality of services provided must be improved, respecting the principle of subsidiarity and taking into account the implementation of the social component of the Europe 2020 strategy. In this respect, defining a statute for mutual societies and other social organisations becomes particularly relevant, along with support for the professional training of their workers and clarification of the procedures for financial support by public bodies. All of these processes should respect the local, regional and national authorities, which take on different roles in the support and financing of social services of general interest (SSGIs) in the different Member States. SSGIs have special characteristics and because of this should not be treated in the same way as any other economic service or be subject to the same competition rules imposed by the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Social services of general interest (SSGIs) represent a large, complex set of measures aimed at meeting the basic needs of European citizens, often focusing on the most vulnerable groups. They are an important instrument for achieving the 2020 strategy target for inclusive growth, while making a significant contribution to job creation, especially for women and the older section of the population. We should not overlook, either, their role in creating opportunities for influencing demographic changes. The provision of suitable, good-quality social services in Europe’s regions is an important step in making them more attractive to their citizens. One of the main features of SSGIs is their great diversity. More in-depth knowledge and analyses are required about how they are organised and operate in Member States and about their contribution to social cohesion in the European Union. This could enable us also to find a balance between these services’ vital social role and the rules of the internal market and competition. In conclusion, I would like to add that the continuing demographic changes make SSGIs increasingly important. At a time of economic crisis and stringent budget constraints, alternative solutions should be found for funding them, for instance, the wider use of public-private partnerships in this area and the appropriate use of the resources from the Structural Funds.</p>

      <p sl="et">European development is based on a social market economy, and there is no doubt that services of general interest are an inseparable part of the European social model. Member States have arrived at the organisation of such services through historical developments, and they are the result of different cultural traditions. It is therefore not possible to create a uniform European model that is suitable for all.</p>
      <p sl="et">Our approach to these topics must be flexible and follow the principle of subsidiarity. There is no need or legal justification for a uniform EU framework regulation to create legal certainty in this area. Member States must ensure equal access to services regardless of a person’s financial situation or gender, above all simplifying access to social services for groups in less favourable positions, such as single mothers and elderly women.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is important that Member States invest in accessible, affordable, high-quality and diverse childcare services and improve care services provided to other dependents; this would be a significant step towards achieving gender equality. We should certainly not forget, however, that we live in an integrating Europe, and the situation in which necessary services are available in one country and not in another is unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I wish to congratulate Mr De Rossa on his excellent report on the future of services of general interest.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It has hitherto mainly been the responsibility of the Member States to produce and organise such services. At EU level, however, we need more harmonised principles in this sector. Access to services of general interest must be guaranteed to all EU citizens, to safeguard their fundamental rights and to narrow increasing health inequalities. It must be society that primarily takes responsibility for organising these services, as a market-driven service system cannot guarantee access to services of general interest for everyone, or access to hardly any services at all, when there is no real market demand for them. If liberalisation measures for services are taken too far, those who need them the most will suffer the most, especially women.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The acquisition of services of general interest must be a process that is as transparent as possible, and one that is in line with the regulations on public procurement. At the same time, however, we need to remember that a flexible procurement procedure is necessary to guarantee a supply of good-quality and appropriate services, one where price is not the only dominant factor. In certain situations we need to be able to favour certain suppliers.</p>

      <p sl="de">In its communication on social services of general interest the Commission already admitted last year that not all the Member States have the financial means to meet the growing demand for social services. In some countries there are, in fact, gaping holes in the social safety nets. It is important that we now fill these gaps.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr De Rossa’s report is an important step in this direction, with the aim that social services may continue to facilitate social equality and social integration in the immediate future. The European Commission’s one-sided political concentration on the rules of the internal market is a big mistake. Budgetary consolidation at all costs is not the solution. The public sector has become the main target of all the austerity measures which are aimed at bringing budget deficits back into line following the rescue packages given to banks threatened with bankruptcy. The loss of public services will only increase the suffering of those who have been particularly hard hit by the current crisis in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the European Voluntary Quality Framework, which aims to ensure high quality even in difficult times. This is, moreover, a voluntary quality framework that includes the stakeholders in the process, and its principles support the quality systems of the Member States. I hope that the Commission will continue along the lines set out in Mr De Rossa’s report and its own communication from last year; in other words, that it will ‘fill the gaps’ rather than tearing open new holes.</p>

    <intervention id="1-262-000" speaker_id="28280" name="Filip KACZMAREK" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Poland" birth_date="22-11-1966" birth_place="Poznań" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="PL">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the report which we will be voting on tomorrow is important for the future of the EU’s development cooperation. Why? In October, the European Commission will present a communication on future European Development Policy Priorities. Towards the end of the year, the Commission will also present a legislative proposal for a future instrument for development cooperation, and in Busan, South Korea, there will be another High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. The Busan Forum is in fact one of the Polish Presidency’s development priorities. This is, therefore, a good time for Parliament to present its own expectations of future EU development policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The basis for discussion on this subject and for our report is the Green Paper on inclusive growth and sustainable development, presented by the European Commission last year. Within the Committee on Development we achieved a wide-ranging political consensus, and we agree with many of the proposals put forward by Commissioner Piebalgs and the Commission as a whole. We believe that development cooperation must concentrate more on outcomes and concrete results than has been the case so far. However, at the same time this does not mean that we want to convert indicators and measures into absolutes. We should avoid a situation where our attention is focused on ‘easy’ countries or sectors, those in which it would be easy to obtain results and not those where the need is greatest. We should not forget aid for those hit hardest by poverty and those who have had the bad luck to be born in countries which are very badly governed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, it is worth remembering that 72% of poor people throughout the world do not live in the world’s poorest countries, but in middle-income countries. Development cooperation cannot be interrupted as soon as a particular country emerges from being one of the poorest nations to being a middle-income country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We also support efforts aimed at improving coordination. We support a proper division of labour and utilisation of those qualities in which individual Member States excel. We support the EU’s proposal to focus more on certain areas, such as renewable energy and agriculture. These are areas of relatively high potential in developing countries. We would like these priorities to be targeted at those hit by poverty and at their needs, for the methods of realising these priorities to allow for small and medium-sized enterprises to become involved, and for them to promote activities at local and regional level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Two further particularly important subjects are sustainable development and climate change. However, the subject which provoked most discussion within the Committee on Development was the term ‘inclusive growth’. I believe that we should not be afraid of this idea. For me, personally, it means growth which is on the side of the poor, in the interests of the poor, growth which will lead to a reduction in social inequalities. In other words, growth is to be accessible to the poor, not just to those who are most active. We realise that this is not an easy task, that social inclusion requires the accomplishment of many difficult tasks: access to labour markets, better labour market standards, the creation of social insurance systems and tax systems. These are very difficult and important tasks. The Committee on Development has repeated many times and on many occasions that when we formulate new tasks or principles we should never forget our earlier obligations. This is the case on this occasion as well.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we wish to rise to new challenges, old promises must be kept. This is a question not only of moral responsibility, but also of our credibility in the eyes of external partners. This is why an increase in the effectiveness of development aid cannot be a pretext for decreasing or freezing the amount of aid for developing countries. It is very important to be consistent in our earlier promises.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thank you to all my fellow Members, to the experts and advisers and to the Secretariat of the Committee on Development for their help in drafting this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, many thanks to the rapporteur. The process of achieving aid effectiveness is an extremely important one for development assistance and I believe that the principles set in the Paris declarations are exactly the right ones that make our development assistance more effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">However we should not confuse the idea of aid effectiveness with value for money. Development does not come overnight. The number of schools that you build does not say anything about the quality of education taught in those schools. We should not fall into the trap of demanding short-term results which might not even support our long-term goals and long-term development. Development takes time. I am very sorry if that does not fit into everybody’s election plans, but that is life and that is how development works, so we should not forget to look at the long-term perspective.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the current situation of crisis obliges us to look again at the Union’s development cooperation work and to make a serious commitment to improving our efficacy and achieving more and better results in the battle against poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union is, without any doubt, an excellent platform for greater and better coordination of EU and Member State aid. Now we have the opportunity to redouble our efforts in terms of aid efficacy, and we know that official development aid alone will not be enough to eradicate poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to point out some of the challenges that lie ahead for European and international development cooperation, and which will require us to act, and will probably demand a rethink of our priorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first of these is development cooperation after the Millennium Development Goals. We should start thinking right now about what new international cooperation objectives must be set in order to end poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second thing is to seek new and innovative funding mechanisms. We know today that official development aid is necessary, but it will not be enough to meet our objective of wiping out poverty. We believe a tax should be introduced on financial transactions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, we need to achieve truly and completely integrated planning in the battle against poverty and the battle against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fourthly and finally, we should think about how to continue cooperation with emerging countries, while at the same time strengthening our work with the least-developed countries.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I wholeheartedly support the idea of giving the European Development Fund a place in the overall EU budget, and I welcome the flexible position outlined by Mr Kaczmarek, and not only with regard to the emphasis on better control of resources, transparency and the efficiency of public administration in countries receiving development aid. However much aid is granted for development, it will come to nothing if it disappears into the jaws of corruption. I also share his fear that it would be problematic to concentrate on a very limited number of safe countries, to the detriment of countries in which the security risk is greater, since this is the very reason why aid might be needed more in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the warning given in paragraph 84 of the Kaczmarek report. It relates to farmland acquisition, above all by Chinese investors. This may pose a serious threat to local residents, above all with regard to their food supplies and the development of agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, there is a central question to this debate, which is, it must be said, very pertinent: the question of consistency, or, rather, the question of inconsistency between the proclaimed objectives of development assistance, and the policies and specific actions applied in practice.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On one hand, the importance of agriculture, industry, local natural resources, training and the transferral of knowledge is acknowledged as they are essential factors in promoting the emancipation and free and autonomous development of less-developed countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, there are those who continue to defend the deregulation and liberalisation of world trade and the financial system, which divert resources from these countries, compromise possibilities for development and worsen their dependence and subjugation. The importance of public health and education systems in combating poverty is recognised but, in practice, they are placed under immense pressure by the so-called structural adjustment programmes, as advocated by the International Monetary Fund, which dismantle these and other essential public services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Property rights often still take precedence over public interest and the health of entire populations; this is so-called raw materials diplomacy, which conceals undisguisable neocolonial visions. These are just some examples of this blatant inconsistency.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the modernisation of European development policy must necessarily be based on an assessment of existing ways in which European Union development policy works. I firmly believe that the European Union must make much greater efforts to support the working and business practices of people in developing countries so that they can gradually make the transition from basic, inefficient work activities, or sometimes from the inactivity caused by a lack of employment opportunities, to work which benefits society and provides a reasonable salary to those who perform the work.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We also need to make sure that business regulations in these countries are straightforward and that their tax systems are simple and fair. We must try to teach the citizens of these countries to catch fish, rather than handing them the fish on a plate, as the saying goes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Kaczmarek very much for this report. I think it fits very well into the current debate that we are having at this moment and the reflection on the future policy. We have just finalised the public consultation on the Green Paper on development policy. It produced 240 written responses, and we have also received a lot of other input from different stakeholders. The findings from this can be seen on the website.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having reflected on the findings of the consultation, the Commission is currently drafting a follow-up communication, and it will be adopted in mid-October. Looking at this, we are very pleased to see that there is very little divergence in our thinking on how to increase the impact of EU development policy. It is clear that we agree on the vital role that doing more to support inclusive and sustainable growth could play in this endeavour.</p>
      <p sl="en">For instance, Parliament supports the suggestions in the Green Paper of focusing EU development on energy and food security. We also agree with Parliament, as expressed in your report, on the vital importance of good governance for poverty reduction, including the importance of fighting corruption and having tax systems working well. We note and share your concern for utmost transparency over the use of aid to incentivise political reform, and the Commission, like Parliament, values the role played by local and regional authorities and of course national parliaments as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, we want to see continued action in the field of human development, notably health and education. The Commission agrees with Parliament that broad measures of poverty should be applied rather than narrow income definitions. It is for this reason that the Commission anchors its support around the achievement of the MDGs, as these provide the best available measure of poverty in the broader sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree that we need to improve effectiveness and transparency. We are all pleased, I think, to see the last European Council confirm the commitment of the Member States to increase ODA levels to at least 0.7% of GNI in 2015. As regards the importance of strengthening policy for the coherence of development, I am obviously very pleased with your paragraph 49, calling for a linkage between external policy and the internal policies on migration.</p>
      <p sl="en">On differentiation we agree that the aid should be targeted at those countries where the need is the greatest and where we can make the biggest difference. However, that does not mean that we will only focus on so-called easy countries and engage in a risk-averse strategy. On the contrary, we consider support to fragile states to be a vital element of development policy. We also noted with interest the remark and the suggestions by Parliament regarding the assessment of the risks of working with and through the private sector and on avoiding a return to tied aid, as well as on innovative financing mechanisms. We also saw your reference to gender equality and support for the most vulnerable sectors of society in developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">In short, I believe that the European Parliament and the rapporteur Mr Kaczmarek will find that many ideas in the report will also be in the future communication. I would like to thank you very much for your contribution.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The European Union is the world’s biggest provider of development aid. Last year, the EU and its Member States donated a total of EUR 53.8 billion in aid. Of this, the European Commission contributed around EUR 10 billion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The problem with aid is getting it to its proper destination. So that we are able to avoid corruption, aid needs to be as transparent as possible, both in the donor and recipient countries.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament is proposing the creation of an electronic database for aid. It will help to increase the transparency of development cooperation projects and their general approval. The database will need to be made as clear as possible. The public must be able to monitor the delivery of aid, and what it achieves, in real time on the Internet.</p>
