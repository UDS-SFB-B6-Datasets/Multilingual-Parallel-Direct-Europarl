      <p sl="unknown">I welcome Baroness Ashton, and declare the session open.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the joint debate on:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the report (A7-0023/2010) by Gabriele Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and the basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) in 2008, presented to the European Parliament in application of Part II, Section G, paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 (2009/2057(INI)),</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the report (A7-0026/2010) by Arnaud Danjean, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy (2009/2198(INI)),</p>
      <p sl="unknown">the oral question to the Council by Gabriele Albertini and Arnaud Danjean, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the Non-proliferation Treaty (O-0169/2009 - B7-0009/2010), and</p>

    <intervention id="3-010" speaker_id="28367" name="Gabriele Albertini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union needs to adopt a new approach and make a joint effort when facing global challenges. The powers recently obtained due to the entry into force of the treaty mean that Parliament engages in frequent, cooperative and effective discussions with our primary interlocutor, Baroness Ashton, who has the honour of acting as the new Vice-President/High Representative for the first time.</p>
      <p sl="it">Her mandate was subject to our consensus vote in January and, on several occasions, the Parliamentary Assembly was promised that the Council and the Commission would be constantly involved in all the most important aspects of European security and defence. As the report itself confirms, the High Representative is therefore called upon to appear before the European Parliament and to consult it frequently and regularly.</p>
      <p sl="it">With the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union’s external action takes on a new and important dimension, but actually achieving this goal also depends on the European Union having the necessary budgetary resources. The European Parliament has a key role to play in its capacity as custodian of the democratic legitimacy of external action. The creation of a European External Action Service will give a diplomatic body and system to the European Union which, until now, has only been able to rely on national representation.</p>
      <p sl="it">The roles of the official representatives, whose appointment is the responsibility of the High Representative, assume great relevance and topicality. Nonetheless, as stated in the report, Parliament is calling for greater powers of ballot and control over the roles and the mandates of individual representatives, upholding the principles of transparency and merit that must guide the High Representative when appointing candidates. It is hoped that we will eventually achieve a situation of double hatting – except in the case of the special representative, whose range of action should be regional – and that we will therefore benefit from economies of scale, making the European Union’s external action more efficient and, at the same time, less costly.</p>
      <p sl="it">After an initial introductory section on strategy, the report addresses the issue of European foreign policy by theme and geographical area. The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied, especially the United Nations, the chief custodian of global security. It must play an important role, not only from the viewpoint of its seat on the Security Council, but also in terms of staff and delegations connecting the two bodies. We call on the Vice-President/High Representative to let Europe fulfil its ambition to become an active, strategic and independent partner of a great ally such as the United States in order to respond to the global challenges of terrorism, finance, and the often fraught relationships with industrial giants such as Russia, China and Japan.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report continues with a geographical analysis of what we can hope to achieve. In the Balkans, the theme of enlargement is introduced: the report praises the gradual achievement of the stabilisation process in Kosovo, where the European Union is present with the EULEX mission, but efforts must still be made to ensure that accession standards are respected for many countries close to candidacy for accession – Turkey and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the chapter concerning cooperation with the East and the Black Sea regions, the report deals with the issue of the European Union’s energy supply security and dependency. In the section on Russia, it calls for a new partnership and cooperation agreement to be signed. As far as the South Caucasus is concerned, the report calls for the territory of Georgia and its ethnic minorities to be left intact, and for conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Transnistria to be resolved</p>
      <p sl="it">Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the European Union must play a stronger political role in relaunching the peace process following the Council decision of 12 December 2009. Union for the Mediterranean: resolution of the Turkey-Cyprus conflict. Asia: Afghanistan, critical period for the establishment of a new government after the elections; Pakistan’s key role in the fight against terrorism; concern over the violation of fundamental rights in Iran. Africa: positive contribution of the Somali coast defence mission. Latin America: need to create a stable and enduring partnership for relationships between the European Union and Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will listen to my fellow Members’ comments with great interest and respond to them at the end.</p>

    <intervention id="3-011" speaker_id="96747" name="Arnaud Danjean" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy that we are presenting today is an annual document by Parliament that provides a kind of interim assessment of the European Security and Defence Policy and submits proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness and visibility of that policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This year, this report lies within a very specific context, and thus it should become a force for proposals. This specific context is characterised by the combination of three major cycles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first concerns the 10 years of the European Security and Defence Policy, which we celebrated at the end of 2009. The last 10 years showed that Europe was able to conduct civil and military operations at the scene of more than 23 crises. That fundamental achievement can be built on further. It shows that there is a demand for Europe and that the Union has the institutional-political and operational ability to rise to these challenges.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second important cycle is, of course – and Mr Albertini mentioned it a moment ago – the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The change in terms of security and defence goes far beyond a strict semantic adjustment. Indeed, the ESDP becomes the Common Security and Defence Policy, the CSDP, and it must take on a new dimension. The Treaty has enriched the range of tools and the scope of security and defence policy, particularly with the inclusion of assistance clauses, of solidarity clauses, with permanent structured cooperation and, above all, with the creation of the European External Action Service and of your role as High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the third major event that characterises the context in which this report was drafted is that NATO which, for 21 of the 27 members of the Union, is still the main reference point where the collective security of the European continent is concerned, is currently revising its strategic concept and that this assessment by NATO should also lead us, the Union, to define more clearly the conditions of this partnership, which remains fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this context, the report’s objective is less about persisting with a doctrine than about providing you with a necessarily evolving roadmap, for all the new institutions that are being established and that must learn to work together. The aim is to make the Union more credible, more effective and more visible in security and defence terms. In this regard, the European Parliament absolutely must be given a greater degree of responsibility in these sensitive areas if a policy of which the main aim is to guarantee the security of European citizens is to be fully legitimate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this report, we wanted to stress the following points. Firstly, we wanted to point out that, above all, the European Security and Defence Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy are there to serve the people of Europe, to guarantee and improve their security. This political ambition is not superfluous; it is not for appearances’ sake. It corresponds to a need for our continent to strive to ensure its own security but also to contribute to the stability of the world around us, to tackle the crises and the threats that are developing in our environment. Beyond the traditional armed conflicts that continue to take place in our immediate environment, Europe must be able to express its interests and defend them in the face of the new threats – I am thinking in particular of piracy and cybercrime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also felt it important to stress just how unequalled Europe’s added value in crisis management is, thanks to the variety of solutions it provides and the balance that it strikes in each of its operations between the civil and military dimensions. Moreover, in this regard, I reject the criticisms that some may direct at the Union’s security and defence policy, namely to suggest that it is all about militarisation. I sincerely believe in the complementary nature of the civil and military instruments that the Union possesses, and the recent crisis in Haiti, where you went – and I believe that you were able to observe this good cooperation – testifies to the need to link our civil and military resources so that we can cope with natural disasters and major crises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Precisely on the subject of these operations, we were anxious to review them all, to highlight what we feel are their strengths, but also, at times, their weaknesses – they have to be acknowledged so that things can improve. We were also anxious to highlight several regions of strategic importance for the security of the Union and to encourage the Council and the Commission to speed up the implementation of global strategies, in particular, for the Horn of Africa and for the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the area of capabilities – both civil and military – which is a crucial issue in terms of the credibility of our policy, the challenge is to improve the Union’s responsiveness. We have to be able to mobilise more quickly and more effectively the material resources and the competent personnel that the Member States have at their disposal. However, we also have to have the capability, by means of a security and defence industry that is efficient, that combines invaluable technological knowledge and that also accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe, to provide ourselves with equipment programmes corresponding to these forecasted needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Europe of industry and defence has begun to organise itself on our continent through the defence package. Issues relating to industrial and trade cooperation with third countries should be addressed quickly, particularly in the light of the recent problems encountered by European industries trying to access the US market, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a brief, inevitably overly brief, summary of the priorities that appear in this report and which represent all the challenges that you will have to take up. Parliament is ready to play its full role, its full positive and constructive role, to help you realise this ambition, which is a common ambition. Moreover, I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the political groups that have worked hard to enrich this report. We have all cooperated very well together to maintain a high level of ambition, while taking account, of course, of the characteristics of each of our groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also take advantage of this opportunity, Baroness Ashton, to address with you today the issue of non-proliferation. On the eve of the Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference, to be held in May, the European Parliament wished to review with you the Union’s commitment in relation to the fight against proliferation, and to the control of arms and disarmament; this is the meaning behind the oral questions that have been put to you and which you will answer shortly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The international context seems to offer new opportunities on the eve of this review conference. Firstly, President Obama has strongly affirmed his ambition to have a world without nuclear weapons and his commitment to actively seek the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty by the United States. Secondly, the conclusion with Russia of a new agreement designed to supersede the START Agreement seems to be going well and, lastly, we have the launch of the negotiations on a new disarmament treaty that would prohibit the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to the reduction in nuclear arsenals, the priority is obviously to reduce the two main arsenals, that is, those of Russia and the United States, which it is commonly believed still alone hold nearly 95% of all the nuclear weapons that exist on the planet. We therefore welcome the commitment made by Presidents Medvedev and Obama to conclude a new reduction agreement in the near future. How does the Union, in this context, envisage supporting these efforts and cooperating with the United States and Russia?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Union must also rise to the challenges posed to the non-proliferation regime and, more specifically, to those with which we are confronted by the two major proliferation crises that are Iran and North Korea, which remain the main threats to international security. Will the Union continue to commit itself effectively, completely, to resolving these crises, particularly in the case of Iran? We expect your guidance on this major issue, Baroness Ashton. Moreover, the Union has a role to play in promoting cooperation relating to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. You know that this is an important challenge. What actions are being carried out in this context, and what is your strategy on the matter?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the European Parliament wants the Union to be a proactive force during the forthcoming Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference. The adoption of a new ambitious and balanced common position by the Union is crucial if the latter is to defend its position. Where do the Member States stand in this regard?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you very much. I am delighted to be with you to discuss the big questions on Europe’s international agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to begin by thanking Mr Albertini and Mr Danjean for their excellent reports. You have underlined, if I may say, the number, range and urgency of the challenges we face.</p>
      <p sl="en">From strengthening the rule of law in Kosovo to working with the emerging powers to share responsibility for global governance, from promoting peace in the Middle East – and may I join Vice-President Biden in condemning the decision to build 1 600 new houses in East Jerusalem – to providing shelter to the surviving victims of Haiti’s earthquake, which I visited last week, from dealing with proliferation problems such as Iran, to devising effective answers to ‘new’ challenges such as energy, climate change and cyber security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe is going through a phase of building something new, where people have to adjust their mental maps and institutions have to find their new place. Doing so is messy and complicated – but also exciting, for it is impossible to overstate how important this moment is. Right now we have a chance to build what many across Europe – and many in this House – have long wanted: a stronger, more credible European foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the European External Action Service will be key to delivering this. We have to build a system that is robust, that will enable us to deal with the problems of today and the new problems that will arise tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">For years, we have been trying to frame and implement comprehensive strategies but the structures and the systems we had made this difficult. With the Lisbon Treaty and the External Action Service, we should now be able to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the heart of everything we do lies a simple truth: to protect our interests and promote our values, we must be engaged abroad. No one can hope to be an island of stability and prosperity in a sea of insecurity and injustice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ours is, if I may say, a world in flux. To engage with it effectively, we need to frame it first. To me, the most striking features of today’s world are twofold. One, a deep interdependence in political, economic and security terms: technologies, ideas, diseases, money – everything moves. We are connected in ways we have never been before. Two, the fact that power is shifting, both within political systems – roughly from governments to markets, media and NGOs – and between political systems – roughly from the old ‘West’ to both the east and the south. Both are the outcome of globalisation which is not just an economic but also a political phenomenon, both in its manifestations and, of course, its consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">Think of the rise of China and others as major political players, or consider the political impact of the financial crisis. The debts are in the West; the surpluses are in the East. This redistribution of financial power is also shaping our political discussions. Or consider climate change, which is not just an environmental problem but also one with security and geopolitical ramifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we have to deal with complex problems and we do so in a new geopolitical landscape. We need to adapt. This is not a time to fly on auto-pilot or to stick to the narrow defence of national ways of doing things. It is a time to be smart and ambitious.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me give you some figures to illustrate the point. Europe’s share of the world’s population is 7%, down from 25% a century ago. In the last 60 years, our share of global GDP has shrunk from 28% to 21%. The economies of China, India and others are racing ahead at 10% per year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Economic weight is translating into political clout and self-confidence. You feel it everywhere: from negotiations on climate change to Iran, to big energy deals in Africa or central Asia. If we pull together, we can safeguard our interests. If not, others will make the decisions for us. It is that simple, really that simple.</p>
      <p sl="en">My preference is clear. We should respond as Europeans. Firstly, by pulling together, because unity is a pre-condition for influence and, secondly, by taking action, because the answer to a problem cannot be a paper or a meeting. If you want results, you have to act and sometimes take risks. And yes, there is a tendency in Europe to put process ahead of outcomes. Thirdly, by being both principled and creative because we must be both: principled in the defence of our values and creative in how we forge bespoke solutions to complex problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Mr Albertini’s report rightly points out, ‘a new approach is needed if the EU is to act collectively and meet the global challenges in a coherent, consistent and efficient manner’. Out of that general picture come several core objectives: firstly, to ensure greater stability and security in our neighbourhood, by promoting political and economic reform. This is important in itself for reasons which are very self-evident, but our wider international credibility also depends on getting our neighbourhood right.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, to address global security challenges, the challenges of our time. For this, we need comprehensive strategies, strong international organisations and the rule of law both within countries and between them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, to build a network of strategic relationships with key countries and organisations because the problems we face cannot be solved by any single actor.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of all this comes the creation of the European External Action Service – a means to achieve the other three objectives and a way to deliver the promise of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those are the core tasks to which I have devoted my time since I took on this role. I first went to Washington and New York, which was the right way to start our important relationships with the United States and the UN. I have since been to Moscow, Kiev, the Balkans and Haiti. I will go to the Middle East next week and again to New York at the end of the month. In between, I have chaired the Foreign Affairs Council three times, attended the informal European Council and met with the College of Commissioners. I have worked hard to build the necessary internal consensus, visiting various EU capitals: Berlin, Paris, London, Vienna and Ljubljana. Naturally, I have spent a significant amount of time on the creation of the External Action Service and that will continue in the weeks ahead, including working with you.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is also why, because of the interests of this House, I have ensured involvement from the European Parliament in the steering group that I set up. I will also discuss it this afternoon at the Conference of Presidents. When I come to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 23 March, we will have an opportunity for in-depth exchanges in the presence of all the relevant committees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any time you create something new, there will be resistance. Some prefer to minimise perceived losses rather than maximise collective gains. I see it differently, and I hope the Parliament does too.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build something new, something that finally brings together the instruments of our engagement in support of a single political strategy. A huge chance for Europe. We should not lower our ambitions but, rather, give ourselves the means to realise them. A moment to see the big picture, to be creative and take collective responsibility. If we get it right – and we must – then we will be able to shape a European foreign policy for the 21st century with an external service designed to achieve it: one where we mobilise all our levers of influence – political, economic, development and crisis management tools – in a coordinated way. A service that represents the European Union in geographic and gender terms too. I believe that is the only acceptable way to go.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me illustrate what I have in mind when I say ‘comprehensive approach’ with a couple of examples.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Western Balkans – I was pleased to travel to the region recently. In a way, the Balkans is the birthplace of EU foreign policy. More than anywhere else, it is where we cannot afford to fail. My purpose was to establish good working relations with political leaders, engage with civil society about what belonging to Europe could mean, and ensure coordination among the different EU actors on the ground. One conclusion I drew was that the region is making progress, even if it is uneven and incomplete. The European perspective remains the overarching framework – both as our objective and as the main incentive for reform. As I stressed everywhere, progress on the path to the EU depends on the commitment to reform at home. On human rights, the rule of law and regional cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are backing up our strategy with available foreign-policy tools. In Kosovo, we have our biggest civilian mission and it is a success. In Bosnia, we have adjusted ALTHEA as the situation has stabilised and developed a training programme. We are pushing the European message hard in the run-up to the October elections. Throughout the region, we are making progress on visa liberalisation and people-to-people contact.</p>
      <p sl="en">So our Balkan Strategy is what it should be: strategic in its objectives, multi-faceted in terms of instruments and tailor-made in terms of implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second example is the Horn of Africa. It highlights the interplay of state fragility, poverty, resource competition including water, with piracy, terrorism and organised crime. The only possible answer is a comprehensive one, which is exactly what we are doing. Our naval operation Atalanta has been widely hailed as a success. Our next step is to further develop our options for the transfer of suspected pirates for prosecution in the region. We are adding a training mission for the TFG in Somalia, with deployment expected in the spring. Through our Stability Instrument, we are funding flanking measures to build capacity, to train the maritime authorities and moving ahead with long-term development work in Yemen and Somalia on poverty, literacy and health.</p>
      <p sl="en">The way we are engaged in Georgia follows the same script. When a frozen conflict erupted into open conflict in August 2008, we responded immediately. We took the international lead, we brokered a truce and deployed a 300-strong monitoring mission in record time. Since then, we are engaged across the spectrum of Community and CSDP means of preventing a return to violence and building stability in Georgia and in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the UN and OSCE, we lead the Geneva talks, the only forum where all concerned meet. We hosted a donors’ conference for reconstruction and economic support in Georgia and we included Georgia – together with Armenia and Azerbaijan – in the European Neighbourhood Policy. We continue to promote those reforms and closer ties. We work on trade and visa liberalisation and we support confidence building measures to rebuild ties with the breakaway republics.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is more work to do in Georgia, and we have a full agenda when we discuss it with Russia, as I did only 10 days ago with Sergey Lavrov. In this case, we demonstrated what the EU can do when we fully mobilise the resources we have. Those who were involved in those incredibly hectic weeks have told me that what was done in this case was exceptional. So we need stronger structures, more flexibility and better preparedness if we want Georgia to be the benchmark for our action in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn to our common security and defence policy and say that I agree with the broad thrust of the Danjean report about how important our missions are. They save lives, create the space for functioning politics to work and they mean that Europe can draw on all its instruments of power to meet its responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is striking to me how far we have come in the last ten years. More than 70 000 men and women have been deployed in that period in more than 20 missions. We do crisis management in a European way with a comprehensive approach in support of international law and agreements and in close cooperation with our key partners. We work well with NATO together in Bosnia and Herzegovina and along the coast of Somalia. In Kosovo and Afghanistan, it is more difficult because of the political issues. We need to get this right so I am working with the NATO Secretary General to improve EU-NATO relations in practical areas and set a positive climate. Let us see how we can develop our relations pragmatically. The UN is another key partner. There are many good examples of EU and UN cooperation on the ground – the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad and indeed Kosovo. In recent times, we have got to know each other better, but we can and should strengthen this by focusing on areas such as planning and the sharing of best practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Danjean report, and more widely, people raise the question of whether it is time for the EU to have its own permanent operations headquarters. It is a serious issue that needs a serious debate. No one contests that we need a headquarters able to plan and conduct military operations. The question is whether the current system, relying on SHAPE or national headquarters, is the most efficient way or if something else is better.</p>
      <p sl="en">We often find ourselves approaching this in terms of structures. I think we first need to do the analysis of what functions we need to perform. I see three main functions from which the decisions should flow: one, the ability to plan and conduct military operations, including advance planning, and to be able to react quickly when there is a need; two, the ability to develop civil-military coordination in a more structured way to maximise our capacity; and, three, the ability to establish links with others, to optimise the overall coordination and what we loosely call the ‘international community’. If we use that analysis as the starting point for our discussions, we should be able to establish the necessary common ground and move forward to determine what we should do.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also calls for the establishment of a Defence Council, an idea that I know has been around for some time. The next meeting in April will follow established practice, but at the informal Defence Ministers’ meeting, a consensus emerged based on my proposals to hold Foreign Affairs Councils in Ministry of Defence formation. That would enable Defence Ministers to come together and take decisions, for instance, on capabilities development.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last point on that relates to the suggestion of a civil protection force. Let us start with the Haiti lessons learned exercise which is now under way. Then let us apply the spirit of Lisbon and see what options we have to mobilise assets of Member States together with EU instruments to support either the UN, OCHA or to act as the EU itself. The watchwords ought to be maximising synergies and avoiding ‘hard’ or artificial splits between how we handle EU internal and external crises.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me, finally, turn to the question of non-proliferation, given the oral question that has been raised. I want to mention briefly the two most significant items: first, the Non-proliferation Treaty review conference scheduled for May in New York. I will be participating with the aim of ensuring that we do get a successful outcome. We should make no mistake: the entire treaty-based non-proliferation system with the NPT as a cornerstone is under growing pressure. To respond, we need to be ready to make our contribution: on access to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in particular, for developing countries, while avoiding proliferation risks, and that includes work on the multilateral nuclear fuel cycle approaches – I think 84 countries have benefited from EU assistance programmes; with progress on nuclear disarmament – politically, this is fundamental to create a constructive atmosphere; and by addressing regional proliferation crises, in particular with Iran, which has the potential to derail the conference.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the EU is leading the efforts to find diplomatic solutions. We fully support the Security Council process on further restrictive measures if – as is certainly the case today – Iran continues to ignore its obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is President Obama’s Nuclear Security summit. We share the goal of the summit, namely, to strengthen the security of nuclear materials and prevent terrorists from getting access. I think that the EU has been providing support to the IAEA since 2004 to assist countries in this area and we will continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me come back to where I started. The demand for European global engagement is enormous. We have to ensure that supply matches demand. The Lisbon Treaty gives us that chance. We should act in line with the letter and the spirit of the treaty, remembering why European leaders negotiated the treaty in the first place. I think the reason was clear: to build a stronger, more assertive and self-confident European foreign policy at the service of the citizens of the European Union. I know many in this House share that goal, and I count on your support to make sure it happens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Ashton on her encouraging statement.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, as the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the CFSP, I want also to underline that it is of core importance that she initiate an audit of past and present CFSP operations and CSDP civil missions in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses. This way, the European Union will be more effective in providing security, will increase its autonomy and will most notably make wiser use of the relevant budget, which regrettably continues to be underfunded.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is frightening to imagine a nuclear device, small in size but potentially lethal for millions of people, falling into the hands of terrorists. Some years back, we could say that this was highly unlikely. We cannot say this any longer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Countries like Iran and North Korea are in the process of acquiring, or have the capability to acquire, a nuclear weapon. A scientist from Pakistan has allegedly sold know-how to Iran, and North Korea has traded in nuclear material. Nobody is against Iran acquiring nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but patience is running thin if Iran is buying time in the dialogue with the 5+1, which we support.</p>
      <p sl="en">The dual-track approach and the preparation of smart targeted sanctions by the UN Security Council are warranted. Nuclear proliferation is at such a critical point that it has led personalities like Henry Kissinger to argue that only the move towards total elimination will ensure non-proliferation and global security.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we support an international treaty for the progressive elimination of nuclear weapons, a halt to the production of fissile material, bringing forward the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, the reduction of nuclear warheads, START, etc., bringing all treatment of nuclear fuel under the control of the IAEA and strengthening its mandate and its verification powers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I hope we are agreed that we need a proactive foreign policy guided by our European common goals and based on our common values. This policy should recognise the indivisibility of security in the globalised world as it is a source of solidarity of interest both within the European Union and outside.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a policy requires and presupposes an adequate institutional instrument. Thus, the priorities are clear and I am happy to see that these priorities I am going to mention are the same as those of Mrs Ashton. An efficient External Action Service, a vibrant neighbourhood policy, a visionary enlargement policy, well-structured partnerships with the strategic players, both traditional and emerging, an effective strategy in coping with the global challenges, namely energy security, non-proliferation, migration, transnational organised crime, transnational expression of poverty, cultural conflicts and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the External Action Service is concerned, we need an institution which should be built not only on the principle of political and budgetary accountability but also on the principle of effectiveness. We should not build a service which preserves the old national competition or the present bureaucratic structure. The two-headed head of the European external actions must wear both hats at all times, thus assuring the unity of the service and the coherence of its action.</p>
      <p sl="en">On external neighbourhood policy, we need an approach which does not exclude Russia and Turkey. On the Black Sea, we have to move from synergy to strategy. On frozen conflicts, we need regional initiatives and mechanisms of regional cooperation and security under international guarantees.</p>
      <p sl="en">On global security, we need a new arrangement reflecting the post-bipolar-order realities. We have to promote our values in the world but in a secular way and not as new crusaders.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that these and many others are our priorities which circumscribe a Herculean task. Let us work together – Parliament, the Commission and the Council – to accomplish this task.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen. Madam Ashton, first of all, allow me to welcome you and say that I very much hope that your excellent and powerful presentation today will indeed herald the end of a particularly difficult period for all of us, which began in November when the Commission’ previous term of office ended. If we can agree on one thing, it is this: we cannot really afford such long periods dithering. From the end of November until very recently, it seemed – and I am sorry to have to say this – as if the EU had disappeared from the world stage, or had come very close to it. Let me reiterate that we cannot permit that to happen under any circumstances. Because, obviously, the world will not wait for us. You quoted some figures which clearly illustrate that. However, we have also witnessed a series of events which have clearly illustrated it: the natural disasters that keep on happening, the horrific attacks that keep on happening, the fact that some governments in the Middle East, despite being democratic, have nonetheless taken decisions which have severely hampered the peace process, or the little that remains of it, and so forth. We therefore need a high representative/vice-president of the Commission who will be in a position to be present on the ground and not only in the European decision-making centres, but also in those elsewhere in the world. Both you and we knew that you were taking on a well-nigh impossible task. I admire you for taking it on. We have promised to support you in it. We are pleased to have heard you speak today and to have been witness to your powerful statement about the European External Action Service, which we all need so desperately. If there is anyone who still has the will to put an end to what the English call turf wars – one side fighting with gloves on and the other without – then I am sure that, if we all work together, we will be able to prepare ourselves well for what lies ahead. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, we listened attentively to what you had to say. Unfortunately, we must observe that we will probably have to wait for some time yet before you develop plans for specific future projects from your essay on your principles, which we actually feel able to support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to say a few words about the External Action Service, however, about which I really had expected to hear something much more tangible from you. You repeatedly said that it is about coherence, which is the order of the day. In many cases, we need joint plans and programmes from the External Action Service and the Commission. Anyone who is in favour of leaving numerous policy areas to the Commission or the Council Secretariat should be honest and admit that he or she is in favour of the status quo, of the system under the Treaty of Nice.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, an important first point is to what extent we are able to achieve a majority on all the issues relating to civil crisis prevention, civil crisis management and reconstruction. In our view, this is all about the things that are covered by the term peace-building, which is to say, conflict prevention, early warning, conflict mediation, reconciliation and short to medium-term stabilisation. We need a corresponding organisational unit for that purpose and so we are proposing the creation of a ‘crisis management and peace-building department’. I would therefore like to ask you your position on the creation of such a department. At this point, I would also like to really emphasise that we support both the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) budget and the Instrument for Stability being incorporated into the External Action Service, yet not as part of, and subordinated to, the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD), but instead, in a new structure which I hope that you will create. I would like to hear your position on this.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second point that is important to us is the connection between the traditional foreign policy areas and new areas such as energy policy, climate policy, justice and internal affairs. What structures are you planning in order to give the External Action Service systematic access to these global policy spheres of the EU and its Member States?</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one more point that is important to us: this must be a modern service with a balanced staffing policy. This week, we celebrated 8 March. It is thus absolutely clear that we believe the rights of women must be firmly anchored in this service and that women must participate in it. Baroness Ashton, a number of female MEPs have written to you to ask that you ensure that, from the very beginning, UN Resolutions 1325 and 1820 are implemented in the institutional structures of the service. So, my question in this connection, too, is: what are your plans in this regard?</p>
      <p sl="de">As I said, you have our support en route to a sound common External Action Service. I look forward to your answers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty is now a legal reality in the international order, even if it lacks popular democratic legitimacy because most EU citizens, including Britain’s, were denied a vote in a referendum. Nevertheless, the ECR Group and British Conservatives are committed to positive engagement and to moving on within the new institutional framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would like to see a similar approach from the Member States and the Commission. It is deeply ironic, in my view, that the first major institutional development under Lisbon, namely the creation of the European External Action Service, threatens to push the EU back towards the very introspection and bickering that Lisbon was supposed to have eradicated. Undoubtedly, the creation of the EAS must be subject to debate and consensus about who does what and does it best, but the CFSP foreign policy elements must remain firmly within the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we also need strong leadership, in theory enabled by the Lisbon Treaty, to forge a lasting vision for Europe’s diplomacy in the world. We look to you, High Representative Ashton, to seize the initiative and to assert the authority and leadership provided to you by the treaty, to knock heads together if necessary and to chart the way forward. We will support you in your efforts if you can show that you are up to the daunting challenge.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has had many years to think about this Service, so this muddling through and hesitation that we currently see does no credit to the EU’s ambitions to play a global role in foreign policy through the CFSP.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are more general points. The Albertini report, which I support strongly, sets out the Union’s foreign policy priorities and rightly endorses the EU membership aspirations for the Western Balkan countries, particularly Croatia, Macedonia and Montenegro, for which I am rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">But it also mentions the transatlantic alliance and NATO, which we believe are the cornerstones of the EU’s foreign security policy. It rightly emphasises the EU’s responsibility for resolving the frozen conflicts, particularly in Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh in our immediate neighbourhood, and good relations with Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, finally, Taiwan is also mentioned as an important partner for the EU and it should also be enabled to participate actively and fully in international organisations, according to the EU’s policy and the ‘One China’ policy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, Mr Albertini already knows the reasons why my group is tabling a minority opinion on the report on foreign, security and defence policy. We are basically doing so, Baroness Ashton, because we have reached a conclusion. In the countries surrounding us, in the European Union, security and defence policies now have nothing to do with defending territory: security policy is now a projection of foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that the prime objective of foreign policy should be achieving disarmament at international level: zero armament, using pragmatic policies that respond to the current causes of insecurity in the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">The main weapons of mass destruction in the world today are hunger and poverty. These are weapons that we cannot fight using military force. We therefore believe that, based on this consideration, we should commit to a transitional security system that will enable the gradual demilitarisation of all security in the world. We obviously do not agree with the Union being linked to NATO, among other things, because NATO’s strategy has been to choose to give a military response to insecurities such as organised crime and terrorism, which have never been matters for a military response.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe that this growing militarisation requires the Member States to have increasingly powerful arms industries and to spend more on weapons. We are at our highest level in terms of civilisation and in terms of weapons, more so than in the Cold War, which is a far cry from pragmatic policies moving towards demilitarisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">No, neither terrorism nor organised crime should be military targets. They should be targets for the police, for the international court services, for the intelligence services, for putting criminals in the hands of the courts, but they should not be the target of a military response.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, we do not agree with this military focus. We do not agree with having United States military bases in the European Union. We do not want this for any state, we do not want any powerful state to deploy military force in the world, and we therefore believe that respect for international law is very important. We do not agree with the recognition of Kosovo – we do not believe in the recognition of any state that uses force outside of international law – because we believe in international law, and we therefore believe that the decolonisation process of the Western Sahara should be in this report. We do, of course, also ask for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, which as NATO itself acknowledges week after week, is causing innocent civilian deaths. We do not, therefore, agree with taking the path of militarisation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Baroness Ashton, Mr Albertini’s truly excellent report contains a passage that I consider to be of great political importance: the part connecting the phenomenon of immigration to the policy of cooperation with developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">To control such enormous migratory flows by means of repressive measures and domestic policy alone would be unthinkable. Distributing migrants throughout European Member States would not resolve the problem either. On the contrary, it would encourage new arrivals. A key response for controlling migratory phenomena is the development of a cooperation policy, preferably coordinated at European level and aimed not only at economic progress, but also at social and democratic progress. Emigration must be a choice and not a necessity.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order that this cooperation policy should be effective and reach those who really need it, it is crucial to promote good local governance, without which there would be inefficiency, corruption, wastage of resources and poor results. Ensuring local governance and the collaboration of governments is the goal of foreign policy, and cooperation must become an important instrument of European foreign policy: this is my personal message to Baroness Ashton within a sector that I hold very dear, in other words, cooperation.</p>

    <intervention id="3-021" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the fact that only very unspecific foreign policy goals were defined in the Treaty of Lisbon is coming back to haunt us now. There will probably also be a price to pay for the fact that, in Baroness Ashton, we have a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy without any real foreign policy experience who was foisted on the Union as the lowest common denominator that the Member States were able to find.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we keep silent on all the important foreign policy issues, we, as Europeans, will be able to achieve just as little as a bunch of diplomats, who shake hands all over the world whilst professing different courses of foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The disagreements about a European External Action Service, too, are something that we cannot really afford. This undoubtedly important new service should not and must not be run down, over the heads of the Member States, into a sphere of activity for Eurocrats.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is probably time that we chopped our way out of the undergrowth in the establishment of this European External Action Service and that the EU was heard again in the outside world. It is also time that the new High Representative acted in a more sensitive way in respect of these matters, including, for example, in using all three working languages of the Union – thus including German – in the European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must make the best use of the experience and good relations which individual Member States have with certain regions. Think, for example, of Austria’s historical experience with the Western Balkans. In so doing, it must be clear that Europe’s security is defended not in the Hindu Kush but on the external borders of the EU in the Balkans. The EU must stop acting as the extended arm and the funder-in-chief of NATO and the United States. European money is definitely better spent on FRONTEX than in the deserts of Afghanistan.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if I might just give some comments directly on the issues and questions that have been raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">To Mr Kasoulides, on the Non-proliferation Treaty review, it is vital that it succeeds above anything else. We believe we have to take practical steps: a comprehensive test ban treaty should come into force; the fissile material cut-off; support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy to find safe ways of making sure that we avoid proliferation – for example, the contributions we make to the nuclear fuel bank – and support for a very strong and effective IAEA. We must work of course especially, as we have said, in areas like the Middle East, which means that we have to continue to put pressure on Iran and address the issues that are raised there.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Severin, on the External Action Service and the priorities that you gave, well, we are in the same place – exactly so. It is very important to me that the Service has political and budgetary accountability, exactly as you have said, and it must be effected in this double-hatted way. It is going to be essential too, as you have indicated, that we draw in and discuss these issues with other key partners. I think you mentioned, for example, Russia and Turkey. Well, Russia I have already visited. I was spending part of the weekend with the Turkish Foreign Minister: a real opportunity to talk in much greater depth about that relationship for the future. So I would agree wholeheartedly with the priorities that you set out and thank you for those.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, thank you for your kind words. I think it was not so much that the EU disappeared from the world stage. It is that the inevitability of that hiatus, of having a Commission that was effective, has now been resolved. And, for my own part, it has been extremely important because, until the Commission came into force, I did not even have a cabinet, never mind an External Action Service. And we are now in a position where we can begin to put the resources together.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is also absolutely right that you raise the importance of being visible on the ground. My difficulty, as you know, is that I have not yet learned how to time travel. But I think it is absolutely essential that, as we look ahead, we look at the priorities that have been set out with which I think this House will largely agree and make sure that my actions are addressed to those priorities, one of which is setting up the Service, which does not yet exist. It does not have a staffing structure. It is not there yet. But when it does have that, we will be able to demonstrate the force of Europe in the best sense of that word across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mrs Brantner, again your common theme to me of trying to get as much detail as possible: I think it is very important. Some of the issues that you have raised are very critical. We do not want duplication within the different institutions in terms of what we do. We want the geographical desk approach to what we do, and I agree with you about peace-building: that it is a very important part of where the EU should act.</p>
      <p sl="en">And in a sense, it comes into building the different elements of what we do well – the work we do on state-building, on justice, on the rule of law, the work we do on development programmes, the work we do on tackling the issues of climate change, the work that we do on providing support to governments and to people – all of that is engineered to make us more secure, stable and prosperous but actually, by doing so, we are creating a more secure, stable and prosperous world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Those objectives are extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you completely about women. We need to get more women, for example, into our policing missions, where there are very few that I have seen so far. We need to make sure that women are firmly integrated into the service at all levels. That is a challenge we need to make sure that we address. But, most importantly, what I would say to you is that the External Action Service is at the service of the whole of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, what we do on justice and home affairs across the world, what do parliamentarians wish to do with other parliaments? We must use the Service as we build it to be able to be your servant in helping you address those issues on the ground. I think on those issues, we are in exactly the same place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Tannock: assertive leadership that is up to the challenge. Well, I hope that you will start to see what you would recognise as assertive leadership. It is very important, as you say, that we address some of these critical issues: the Balkans and the transatlantic relationship are absolutely core and central to what we do. It is why we spend a lot of time in discussion with the United States and why I personally spend a lot of time in discussion and dialogue with them and, of course, Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that you were pleased with my decision to go to the inauguration and then to invite President Yanukovich to come to Brussels where he spent one of his first days. He was inaugurated on Thursday. He was in Brussels on Monday in order to begin to further and deepen that relationship for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Meyer, you talked about the issues of foreign policy and disarmament and the issues of whether it is appropriate to think in military terms. Let me just give you two very quick examples, one of which I have already described which was at Atalanta and the importance of having a comprehensive approach to what we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have, off the coast of Somalia, ships which have been extremely successful this weekend, by the way, with the French navy in capturing pirates who were determined to create havoc in that part of the sea. Linked to that is making sure that they are prosecuted and treated properly by reference to our own judicial standards in the countries of that region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Linked to that is the development programme that the Commission is working on to try and support the economy in Somalia so that it improves. Linked to that is the work that we are about to start on training people to be able to provide security in the region. In other words, it is a joined-up approach and it is a comprehensive approach. That means you use the tools that you need to be able to address the problems that people face.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another example: having been in Haiti last week, I must pay tribute to the Italians that I saw working there. People fresh from the tragedy of Aquila, but here we had the navy, we had the fire fighters, we had NGOs, we had civilians, we had doctors, we had psychiatrists, we had dentists, we had nurses, all working under the umbrella of the commander, actually, of the ship who had a hospital ship full of people who were being treated from the direct consequences of the earthquake. Young people with amputations; children who had terrible burns who were being treated; teams out there to support them.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I am trying to say is that I think you have to think about the comprehensive strategy and approach that we can offer that involves using the means that we have and using them to greatest effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Provera, on development cooperation immigration, you make an important point, which is that, if people feel they have no other choices, then they will take risks, often with their lives, to leave the country where they live and were born and want to live. Most people want to be able to live in the country in which they have grown up.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the important thing about development, in my view, has always been to be able to support the economic livelihoods of people in order to enable them to be able to stay and live where they wish to live in order to be able to get the educational support, the health support and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is going to be a very big part of what we are doing on the ground, and that helps particularly in states where instability, because of climate change, could be very difficult.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr Mölzer, do not be so pessimistic, is what I want to say to you. It is not about operating above the heads of Member States. It is about building something uniquely European – not the same as what happens in Member States, whether it is Germany, Italy, France, the UK or wherever. It is not the same. We are building something different that is about long-term security and stability, economic growth on the ground that we can contribute to that is in our interest but that actually is also about the values that we hold dear.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, as for my languages, oui, je peux parler français, mais je ne suis pas très bien en français. Ich habe auch zwei Jahre in der Schule Deutsch gelernt, aber ich habe es jetzt vergessen.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I can do the languages, and I will get better and better. I look forward to getting to the point where I can have a real conversation with you in much better German than I can do today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Albertini and Danjean reports, as well as the motion for a resolution on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, show that important decisions will soon have to be taken and that we need to prepare for that. Allow me to single out a couple of further examples. I believe that the European Union now has an important role to play in a crucial phase in which the aim must be to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons and that there needs to be a real flurry of activity in the 5+1 group, specifically in connection with the preparation of a UN resolution and the possible extension of sanctions, in order to prevent the advent of a new nuclear State by non-military means. The dramatic situation in the Middle East, and the resolution of the problems there, is connected to this, directly or indirectly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank you for travelling to Kiev to talk to President Yanukovich. It will be of crucial importance to succeed in bolstering such countries so that they do not make any wrong decisions and to be clear that a customs union with Russia and a free trade zone with the European Union are not compatible and for the advantages of making the right choice to be made clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have one more comment to add. In contrast to many foreign and defence ministers, we will exercise the necessary patience to build a sound External Action Service with you. We want this External Action Service. It must be successful. It is a precondition for our ability to speak with one voice. It would be wrong to take excessively quick and thus wrong decisions. We are not under time pressure here – we need a sound result. We do need to consider, however, that, in its history, the Union has been successful where the Community method was applied and that, where it has acted intergovernmentally, it has rarely or never succeeded. It must therefore be clear that those things that are Community policy must not be stealthily transformed into intergovernmental policy via the External Action Service. We need to build in safeguards to this effect so as to secure the efficiency of the unitary service but, at the same time, also the Community policy and the rights of the European Parliament that that involves – in respect of the budget, budgetary control and the granting of discharge – as well as political supervision rights on the part of the European Parliament. We hope for positive collaboration.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I address you, Baroness Ashton, as Vice-President of the Commission, but also as High Representative – as, in contrast to the foreign ministers, I assume that, as High Representative, you also have some degree of political responsibility to this House. Today marks 100 days since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force. There are two imminent and significant decisions to be made in terms of our direction of travel. One of them – as you, too, said at the beginning – is to expand foreign policy because the climate, energy and other matters are part of foreign policy, and the other is creating a dynamic and effective External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking of energy policy, Copenhagen showed that, if we are not united, if we are fragmented, if every Head of Government believes that he or she has to produce something specific, we will achieve less than we would otherwise have done. Not that we would have achieved something amazing, given the position of China and of the United States, but the terrible soap opera that was Copenhagen really should not be allowed to happen again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore – and I agree with Mr Brok in this regard – we need to obtain a sturdy External Action Service. I, like many of us, am not surprised, but am nonetheless appalled, to see how many of the foreign ministers are making problems for you out of petty jealousy. We are saying this very plainly. Many do give you their support, but many are making problems. They simply cannot tolerate the fact that they no longer have the lead role to play and are instead foreign ministers again. At the end of the day, being a foreign minister is not a bad job, and it does not need to mean that you should decide every detail of what goes on in the European Union. For that reason, we also say clearly from here that we will use our parliamentary capabilities to the full not to prevent something, but to build something constructive. An External Action Service is constructive – as it says in the Treaty of Lisbon – when it is clearly subordinate to you, Baroness Ashton, and also, of course, when it collaborates closely with the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">Similarly, we will not tolerate any legal activity that has hitherto been conducted using the Community method and that is to continue in that way under the Treaty of Lisbon suddenly becoming intergovernmental. That, you see, is exactly what many ministers and perhaps even many Heads of Government want, not only in order to undermine the Commission a little, but also to undermine Community law. That is not acceptable. A clear line must be drawn.</p>
      <p sl="de">How that will play out in relation to the External Action Service is something there will be discussions about over the coming weeks – as before. I will thus also finish on something that has already been said. It is not a question of timing, even if we do want a solution quickly, but one of content-based presentation. It needs to be said once again, specifically to the Council of Foreign Ministers, that this Parliament will exercise its rights – no more, but also no less – in connection with the budget and the Staff Regulations because we have a goal, which is an effective and efficient External Action Service.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we all expected that there were going to be teething troubles in bringing the treaty into force and we might apologise for failing to include a clause on time travel in the treaty, but the thing we failed to expect and cannot accept is a breakdown of trust between the Commission and Council in setting up the External Service. The solution is found in the treaty, which ought to be appreciated and respected scrupulously.</p>
      <p sl="en">Article 40 protects the respective functions of the Commission and the Council. Both of them should apply pragmatism to ensure that a strong, effective, coherent diplomacy can be created across the breadth of policy. Catherine Ashton gives us a graphic description of the EU as a rising power from a declining continent. It is quite clear that the Afghan campaign is a problem that commands our attention; a profound reform of strategy and tactics is required. Our task should be to reassess the purpose, cost and duration of our engagement there.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ALDE Group is anxious to press the accelerator on defence. We must find the common security interests of the 27 states and draw on comparable exercises in these states and a frank appraisal of the strengths of the ESDP missions, creating circumstances for bringing forward permanent structured cooperation in defence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, I would like to thank Mr Danjean for his excellent report, in which he explains where we now are in relation to the common security and defence policy. He also explains which points we do not have agreement on.</p>
      <p sl="de">If Parliament adopts this report, it will have come further than the Commission and the Council, in a few specific points, as this report, for example, once again makes express and positive reference to the Barnier report on European civil protection. It is regrettable that Baroness Ashton has just rejected that idea once more.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lady Ashton, I regret that one of the few points in your presentation where you said ‘no’ was to this idea of Mr Barnier’s, whereas on most topics, you seem to be at the same place as everybody else.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new report, like the Albertini report, supports a Union training mission in Somalia. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance reject that idea. We are stumbling into a mission, there, where it is clear neither what its added value is in relation to what has already been done in the region nor within what broader political framework it is based, or whether it actually makes any contribution at all to national reconstruction in Somalia. The likelihood is extremely high that we are paying over the odds in order to train foot soldiers who will then move on to the next warlord willing to pay the most.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to make a third comment. This report talks of the goal of achieving Europe’s strategic autonomy in the field of security and defence policy. For me, that is excessive – we are biting off more than we can chew here. I do not believe that any of the Member States is in a position to come up with the mammoth military expenditure that we would need if we were taking that wording of achieving ‘strategic autonomy’ seriously. As it happens, I also think that this would be a strategic mistake in any case. Europe must find its role in a meshwork of European and global security, and such a role cannot be that of a strategic stand-alone. It would therefore be better for us to agree, very rationally and realistically, to enhance those capacities and structures that give us the capability of acting more autonomously.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mrs Ashton, Mr President, an influential Russian military officer has stated that if Russia had possessed Mistral-class amphibious assault ships, the invasion of Georgia would have lasted about half an hour. Meanwhile, France is selling Mistrals to Russia, despite the fact that the Sarkozy plan has not been implemented, and, at the same time, France is giving its support to the North European Gas Pipeline.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is difficult to talk about security in Europe if we run away from discussion about the situation on the European Union’s eastern border, but this is what happened throughout the work on the report, and I am speaking now, with great regret, to the Chair of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. Efforts were made, at all costs, not to speak about matters such as the ‘Zapad 2009’ manoeuvres. Pains were taken not to speak about this, as if policy on security and defence – a common policy for the European Union, which it is our role to create – were the policy of only a few large countries. A great deal was said about what is happening a long way away on the other side of the world, and about what is happening in almost every part of the globe, but at all costs – this approach was also adopted by many Members – attempts were made to run away from substantial problems on the eastern border of the Union. It was an exceptional muddle of a kind of European megalomania and a disregard for the interests of some Member States. This is the reason why we are not going to endorse this report, but it is also a request I would like to make to Mrs Ashton.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I would like to make clear at this point that we are deeply concerned about the development of EU foreign policy towards militarisation and an increasingly interventionist policy. That is a dangerous development. I want to say, in all clarity, that we believe that a military approach to conflict resolution or to the supposed stabilisation of countries or regions is absolutely the wrong way to go to achieve greater security for the EU and the world. Military interventions – and Afghanistan, unfortunately, is a very current example of this – bring suffering, death and prolonged devastation, but no peace and no improvement in the situation as far as the resident population is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Danjean report lists what are referred to as key threats that constitute a challenge for the EU’s future security policy. One of these is climate change – something that has been overwhelmingly caused by the industrialised nations of the West. If people in the countries of the South have to take flight because they no longer have any water and food becomes scarcer and scarcer, they will represent a security problem for Europe. Such a view is cynical and inhuman. If States collapse as a result of neoliberal economic policy, they will constitute a security problem. What we need is not more military, it is a change, an end to the European Union’s neoliberal orientation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European External Action Service, the European Defence Agency, the creation of a crisis management and planning directorate and the planned start-up fund to fund military operations are designed to make the EU a global player in military terms. We believe that moves towards centralisation in the European External Action Service are a dangerous and undemocratic development. The EU should assume a leading role in relation to demilitarisation and disarmament, especially in the field of nuclear disarmament. There needs to be a push for the obligation incumbent upon nuclear States under Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, which is to say, complete nuclear disarmament, to be honoured at long last. This was a key promise that constituted the basis on which many States signed the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and have, as a result, durably refrained from acquiring nuclear weapons. Reliable guarantees of non-aggression are the best means of preventing proliferation as, otherwise, countries threatened with intervention will attempt to deter such an attack by means of acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p sl="de">If nothing else, I would like, in this context, and in particular with regard to Iran, to point out and to warn that military operations or military activities of any kind to prevent proliferation are completely counter-productive and highly dangerous. We will be rejecting the Danjean report and have tabled our own resolution on the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ‘Chinese billions for the Balkans’ is a recent newspaper headline which certainly calls for a European response in this debate since, at the end of the day, the new Chinese investment initiatives are targeting countries which have already become members of the EU or those which aspire to that status.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Council and Commission, how do you view China’s role in the Balkans? After all, it embraces a range of economic activities: from financing and carrying out major public works, to providing investment for industry and agriculture and buying up ports. The crucial point here is that the Chinese approach is definitely incompatible with Western standards. The big question now is: has this Chinese agenda on occasions thrown a spanner in the works of the EU’s laborious enlargement agenda for this region? Whatever your answer may be, the Chinese clock is ticking faster and more productively than the Western one, in this region, as well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me briefly address two issues. First of all, the duty to provide assistance is clearly not compatible with Austria’s neutrality, and for that reason, it would be important to include the following points in this report. It must be stated, firstly, that the duty to provide assistance is not legally binding, secondly, that the use of military means is not necessarily required and, thirdly, that the individual Member States retain the freedom to decide what the assistance they provide actually comprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">The committee did not accept this, primarily from a content point of view. In my opinion, the very way in which this was rejected also demonstrates a serious lack of respect. I ask for more respect from you, Baroness Ashton, for us Austrians in this very sensitive area.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns the minority report. The quality of democracies and societies, of course, is demonstrated time and again by their treatment of minorities. For me, it is a very, very good thing that we have this option of a minority report. I do not agree with all the points in it, but I am very pleased that Mrs Lösing did make use of this option.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to take advantage of the excellent reports by my fellow Members, Messrs Danjean and Albertini, to speak up again in support of the key role of the High Representative. For the good of all, it is to be hoped that she, Baroness Ashton, realises how important her role is, that she defends it, and that she is determined to assert this role when giving substance to the requirements of the treaty, for example in strengthening the European Union’s relationships with its strategic partners, and in consolidating its own leadership in multilateral forums.</p>
      <p sl="it">In short, we urgently need a strategy that ultimately identifies the real interests that we intend to pursue, and it is important that we involve Member States in significant objectives. It is also important not to let ourselves be conditioned by any interinstitutional disputes over the division of responsibilities – I am referring particularly to the future European External Action Service. Essentially, Baroness Ashton, we want you to play a key role. We want you to play a key role without being bureaucratic.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allow me, then, to make this observation: I am truly sorry that you have decided not to participate in today’s discussion on Cuba. I know that you have every good reason for this and that you will be the first to participate in the discussion on the Arctic, which is also of great importance. But Cuba libre is not only the name of a cocktail: it is the rallying cry of democracy that so many people in this Parliament carry in their hearts. I therefore hope that you will find the time to attend, contribute to and back Parliament’s decision with your strength and with the strength of your role. You are participating in the debate on the Arctic, and you will see that Cuba libre goes down better with a bit of ice.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Council’s annual report was drafted in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue, which is indicative of our approach to all strategic issues. A substantial part of the report is devoted to the ramifications of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="bg">On this point, I would like to focus attention on one important aspect of our joint cooperation. The success of the common foreign policy and the actual results from the institutional reforms implemented are becoming a fundamental factor which will determine the attitude of European citizens towards the European Union’s ability to defend their interests, to change and to develop. Justified or not, expectations are high for a sharp rise in the European Union’s role on the world stage, and we have no right to disappoint Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Unfortunately, in recent weeks, the European press has, not without justification, been casting foreign policy in an extremely negative light, portraying it as a contest between Member States for posts in the new External Action Service, as a competition between the institutions in terms of which hat Baroness Ashton will wear more often – that of the Commission or the Council – and as an unfair struggle by the European Parliament to achieve greater influence.</p>
      <p sl="bg">You realise that this is harming us internally. Furthermore, it is also particularly damaging as a message to our external partners. Division makes us weak in their eyes.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why I am taking the opportunity in this debate to make an appeal. All of us who have a stance on devising and developing the Common Foreign and Security Policy must concentrate on the important strategic issues and endeavour to show, as quickly as possible, tangible results through more dialogue and a constructive approach. We owe it to Europe’s citizens to make them feel that they are part of a single European Union whose voice is heard and has clout in global politics.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the joint motion for a resolution on the Non-proliferation Treaty is a very important one, and the ALDE Group and I are very proud to have contributed to its elaboration. The resolution is holistic because it encompasses all the disarmament matters, from the NPT review conference to the issue of nuclear weapon-free zones.</p>
      <p sl="en">This resolution calls for a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and for the withdrawal of all tactical warheads from European soil, in the context of a brotherly dialogue with Russia. This resolution also frequently refers to a nuclear weapon-free world, a target to be achieved through a special convention and within an ‘ambitious’ timeframe – this means a short one.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our resolution is the European answer to President Obama’s proposal of the abolition of nuclear weapons. This document should be considered, therefore, as a step on the road to the total ban of atomic weapons. It means to end the paradox of the possession of nuclear devices by some countries, which is legal on the one side, and the complete prohibition of chemical and biological arsenals for all countries, on the other side. Atomic bombs must be made illegal and their possession should one day be considered a criminal act. I am confident this Parliament will continue in this direction with even more drive and more vision.</p>

      <p sl="de">You also said, however, that Bosnia has stabilised. Baroness Ashton, in the current state in which Bosnia finds itself, stability and stabilisation are actually dangerous. Not everyone is able to take part in the democratic process. The constitution, as it currently exists – the Dayton constitution – was a sign of stability in the 1990s, but it is no longer that today. What kind of strategy do you, do we, as the EU, have to change that? You said that you have a strategy for Bosnia. That is handling by the Office of the High Representative – but where is the EU’s strategy? I would like you to tell me that. I think that the EU still needs to develop a strategy in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to Kosovo, you described EULEX as a success. That is only partially true. There is still much to be done here, for example, visa liberalisation for the citizens. Baroness Ashton, I call on you to ensure that the Commission immediately starts work on a roadmap in order to make it clear to the citizens of Kosovo that they will not be left on their own.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, you did not answer a question posed by Mrs Brantner. A dedicated department, a dedicated Directorate-General for peace-building within the External Action Service, would be the order of the day. You agree with us that peace-building is important, but will you anchor it in the External Action Service? Will you set up a dedicated Directorate-General for peace-building? That would be necessary to make it clear where the European Union is heading.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, where the EU can add value, and when it does not undermine our sovereign interests or compete with organisations such as NATO, we can support it.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the most part, this will mean adopting common positions on certain key issues and civil tasks in the field of humanitarian assistance or post-conflict reconstruction and development, although I have to say that the track record of EUPOL in Afghanistan does not inspire much confidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The simple truth is that your role as EU foreign minister is to act as handmaiden for EU political integration. The effect of the External Action Service, the chain of EU embassies around the world, will be to undermine national representation in many capitals, armed perversely with cash that has come from our nations in order to take forward someone else’s foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report before us on EU security and defence policy is a manifesto for EU military integration, deliberately confusing military and civil crisis management in order to justify an EU role. It relies on a bogus narrative concerning EU operations and increasingly seeks to involve the Commission in areas which are properly the responsibility of our nations and of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Virtually every paragraph of this report advocates ratcheting up military EU integration at the expense of NATO and the sovereign integrity of individual European countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recall one of the great red lines of the British Labour Government’s negotiating stance when it said it would resist the idea of a separate and permanent EU operations centre responsible for operational planning and conduct of military operations as this would be the clearest example of duplication of NATO, whose SHAPE headquarters performs precisely this role.</p>

I shall refer, in particular, to the excellent report by Mr Danjean, whom I should like to thank for his productive cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="el">I wish to raise four points:</p>
      <p sl="el">Firstly, especially after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the reference made to the central role of the UN system and the call on it to strengthen multilateral cooperation are important.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, we support close cooperation with NATO. However, we would emphasise that this cooperation should not obstruct the independent development of the defence capability of the European Union. On the contrary, full account must be taken of the differences between the two organisations and their independence must be left intact, especially as regards decision taking.</p>
      <p sl="el">Thirdly, I think that we need a paragraph on the need for enhanced cooperation with Russia, which is a strategic partner for the Union in sectors such as energy security, crisis management and others.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the report now includes references to the need for general disarmament, with the emphasis on light weapons, anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions. At the same time, however, I consider that the European Parliament should take a clearer stand and ask the Member States to provide real support for the Obama initiative for a world without nuclear weapons. Disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons can be achieved if each and every one of us takes a step towards attaining this ultimate objective.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would particularly like to highlight the recommendation made in the report on this assembly’s cooperation in monitoring EU policies. In light of paragraph 1 of the Treaty of Lisbon, I believe that we can share the responsibility of this Parliament and the national parliaments for promoting a more coherent approach on this political measure.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I want to continue to mention, Mrs Ashton, the need to expect a much more coherent strategy from you on security policy. As far as the External Action Service is concerned, I believe that the staff who will work in this Service and for Europe’s citizens must represent proportionally the expertise of the Member States because, unfortunately, very many institutions have achieved a hidden level of incompetence and bureaucracy, which could damage a global, coherent vision of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to ask you a question about the battlegroups, structures which we have created but, unfortunately, have not used.

      <p sl="ro">I particularly welcome the insertion of paragraph 47 in the text, which underlines the importance of regional cooperation within the framework of the Eastern Partnership and Black Sea Synergy, because I believe that this area is one where the European Union’s involvement may lead to real change from both an economic and political perspective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I would also like to extend my congratulations to Arnaud Danjean for drafting a report which successfully manages to touch on not only all the challenges facing, but also the achievements of the European Union in the area of security and defence policy. I believe that, at the time of the tenth anniversary of the launch of this policy, the proposals made in the Danjean report are extremely important in terms of improving the EU’s actions, which will certainly contribute to the security of European citizens and, ultimately, to peace and international security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to emphasise at this juncture one particular point from this excellent report about the importance of the partnership with the United States in the area of crisis management, peacekeeping and military matters in general. In this respect, the anti-missile defence system project launched by our US partners is important not only for my country, Romania, which has decided to be involved in it, but also in a wider sense, because the proliferation of ballistic missiles poses a serious threat to Europe’s population.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should mention that I supported Amendment 34 submitted in relation to paragraph 87 of the report because I believe that if the anti-missile shield project could help establish a dialogue at European level, the reference to the dialogue with Russia does not make any sense in this context.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the reports drawn up by Mr Albertini and Mr Danjean are very important documents coming at a crucial moment: the Lisbon Treaty has just entered into force, the EU has a new Parliament and transatlantic cooperation looks more promising.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Danjean’s report addresses the new security challenges facing EU members. To that effect, it calls for a White Paper which would trigger a public debate and raise the profile of the CSDP, establishing a clearer relationship between objectives and interests, on the one hand, and the means and resources to attain them, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also comes up with – and this is a very good thing – concrete proposals, and points to the areas which need further effort in the military domain. At the same time, some of the proposals, such as the introduction of a European preference principle for defence acquisition and a call for the obligatory participation of the European defence industry in the coming US missile defence system, look pretty impossible to reconcile, while answering every need with a new institution is not always practical.</p>
      <p sl="en">In general, with Europe constantly diminishing its military expenditure since the end of the Cold War and a public disinclined to support military action in general, the approach to CSDP should not only be mechanical but equally political. Restoring political will in this respect is thus indispensable for a successful CSDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the report is important because it addresses the very topical issue of the role of the European Parliament with respect to CSDP. I want to thank Mr Danjean and my colleagues for their contributions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the motion which has been submitted for a resolution of Parliament on the Common Foreign and Security Policy is intended, among other things, to establish military structures as part of the European Union. I appeal for the establishment of a special European Union defence council and military operations centre. These instruments will serve to give the Union the status of a world player in military affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be remembered that out of 27 EU Member States, as many as 21 are members of NATO. Only six EU countries do not belong to NATO, and most of these have declared neutrality. This gives rise, therefore, to a fundamental question – does the motion which has been submitted have as an objective the development of a number of EU countries, or is it also a serious step on the road to building a separate military bloc in competition with NATO? Even in the mid-term perspective, it will not be possible to maintain membership in both organisations at the same time. Therefore, voting in favour of this report, today, will, in reality, destroy the civil nature of the Union, will show the red card to NATO and will be the beginning of building an alternative military bloc.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly congratulating my two fellow Members on their reports, which have formed the basis for a very good debate with excellent results. There are a few guiding principles that I would like to mention. Firstly, on the common foreign policy: unfortunately, we currently have a many-voiced image of the European Union. High Representative, I would like to ask and call on you to make sure that we help achieve and indeed ensure that Europe speaks with one voice. That is highly necessary if we are to achieve a pan-European alignment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it is right that transatlantic relations have been mentioned. In the diplomatic field, in the economic field, in security policy and in defence policy, we do need a close partnership with our colleagues in the United States, but as equal partners on an equal footing. It must also be the case that citizens’ rights and security issues be dealt with on equal terms, as Parliament ultimately impressively demanded in relation to the SWIFT Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point is that it is right that the Western Balkans are an absolutely crucial factor in the European security and foreign policy of the future. We need to give these States European perspectives. That means politically stable relations, personal safety and economic development. A European External Action Service should and must – and Parliament is on your side in this regard – help to achieve all of this. We perceive this European External Action Service to be a service for Europe and not for the Member States, for the institutions, European thinking and working, not for other interests. Parliament will be on your side on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, I also support the German Foreign Minister, who is demanding that German should be one of the working languages of the European External Action Service.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, yes, we need a common foreign, security and defence policy, but let us use it to obtain a world free of nuclear weapons. We know that that will not happen overnight; we have been fighting for this for too long to think that. However, perhaps we can succeed, together with Presidents Obama and Medvedev, in bringing this goal a crucial step closer.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also welcome the fact that, according to its coalition agreement, Germany’s Federal Government intends to ask for the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Germany. That would represent a clear and unambiguous signal. We also welcome the fact that the Secretary General of NATO is to hold a comprehensive debate about bringing the overarching goal of a world free of nuclear weapons closer without having to neglect security interests. That, too, would be a crucial step forward.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, I believe that, together with a well-structured External Action Service, there is much that you will be able to achieve. I am therefore full of hope in this regard and I have to say that, in many commentaries that we have to sit through in this Chamber – in particular from a so-called parliamentary group from the United Kingdom – the quality in this House has really suffered terribly.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The excellent reports from my fellow Members, Albertini and Danjean, include many inspiring ideas about how to streamline the main aspects and key opportunities in implementing the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to stress that right now, when the concept for creating the European External Action Service and operating it in the future is being processed, it is extremely important that this service is set up on a maximally rational basis right from the start. That is, to serve the European Union’s primary objectives and the efforts to strengthen its position in the world.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As we can see today, this is not a simple or easy task. In developing the concept of service, we are already seeing that the often conflicting interests of the various European institutions and their individual components are clashing, and sometimes even with groups and individuals within them. To this we can also add the national interests of individual Member States. In this situation, it is necessary for all the players and participants in this process to be responsible, broad-minded and objective in order to be able to rise above their own egos and keep in mind mainly the common objective: the establishment of a diplomatic service that will be operating as a homogenous element, serving exclusively the needs of the European Union and its Member States. Here is the very important leadership role – yours, Baroness Ashton. It would be a mistake if special interests and the desire to impose own opinion at the expense of another at all costs, with the aim of demonstrating own importance and status, were to overcome the need for a broader perspective. The outcome of this effort will bear witness to whether we are really concerned about a stronger European Union or whether it is just another demonstration and contest about whose position within the European Union’s structures is the strongest.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam High Representative/Vice-President, I would like to emphasise the fact that we are discussing three excellent documents drawn up by Parliament: ambitious documents that express clear stances, make clear-cut choices and are subject to broad consensus between the groups within this Parliament who care about Europe and its future. It is an important fact, demonstrating Parliament’s will and ability to offer itself as a candidate to play a central role in CFSP/CSDP on the basis of what I would call a dynamic reading of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="it">We intend to exercise this role in the process of constructing the External Action Service, not only to guarantee Parliament’s prerogatives, but also to contribute to making the service an organisation capable of ensuring that EU external action is consistent and efficient while, at the same time, strengthening and gradually extending the community method.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards the Danjean report, I would like to highlight that the concept of strategic autonomy is presented in the context of a multilateral approach, and that it is a condition for strengthening the strategic partnership with the United States. I would also like to highlight the fact that Parliament is united in requesting an Operations Centre, and I am glad that you, High Representative, have declared yourself open to a more exhaustive discussion of this idea.</p>
      <p sl="it">Concerning the non-proliferation resolution, I would like to underline the importance of envisaging a world free from nuclear weapons, the clear judgment on the anachronism of tactical nuclear weapons and the value of the positions recently adopted by some European governments on this front. Thus, Parliament’s message is clear, realistic and ambitious, and we hope that the High Representative is able to grasp and endorse it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, may I congratulate colleagues Albertini and Danjean on their comprehensive and creative reports on foreign and security policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is bound to be a global player, as you said, High Representative, but with seven per cent of the world’s population and one fifth of GDP, it will be possible only on the basis of strengthened transatlantic cooperation based on common values.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the EU should show a determined will to develop coherent strategies in five crucial areas: common strategies for China, Russia, peace in the Middle East, Afghanistan, and energy security.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is still a major handicap for our credibility and efficiency in the world that often we have not been able to form a unified position in these areas. The principal challenge for you will be to carry into practice your excellent statement about building a single political strategy and taking collective responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcomed paragraph 10 in colleague Danjean’s report which urges the Council and the Commission to analyse cyber threats and to coordinate an efficient response to such challenges based on the best practices. Cyber warfare is not a challenge of the future: it has become an everyday practice. Therefore, it is an immediate task for the EU to work out a European cyber security strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, on the European External Action Service: I think the forming of the EEAS should be based on a fair geographical balance and equal opportunities for representatives of all Member States, new and old, with application of the quota system. Only this will guarantee the efficiency and transparency and, finally, the credibility of the new diplomatic service.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, High Representative Ashton has asked us this morning to change mental maps, to challenge resistance to institutional change and to avoid narrow defence of national interests. If Parliament means what it says on the CFSP, we have to send a clear message that we will support a strong, comprehensive and inclusive External Action Service and, in observing our own prerogatives, we will not be part of any vested interests seeking to limit the capacity, and therefore the effectiveness, of that service.</p>
      <p sl="en">That should mean appointments on merit and merit alone, appointments from Member State foreign ministries from day one and from across all of the European Union; it means incorporation of strategic advice on issues like energy supply and environmental policy; it means organisational structures which reflect global reach and give due weight to Africa and to transatlantic relations as well as to Asia, Latin America and our neighbourhood; it means sufficient financial margin, not just for rapid reaction or humanitarian response, but to move monies to reflect new political priorities; it means endorsing Cathy Ashton’s decision to put disaster response above disaster tourism and for her to provide key direction to financial programming and it means this Parliament supporting new arrangements with deputising which reflect international practice rather than necessarily sticking to our past rules.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Union’s foreign policy is entering a new phase, as Baroness Ashton and Mr Albertini have said this morning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Article 21 of the treaty establishes objective principles. New positions are also created by the treaty, with a High Representative, a Vice-President of the Commission, a permanent President of the European Council, a European External Action Service, and a new Security and Defence Policy, which is the subject of the report by my colleague Mr Danjean, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">These innovations aim to ensure that the European Union has a much more effective influence in the world, and I think that summits with third countries continue to be an ideal instrument for achieving this. The European Union does not hold many summits with individual countries, so we should take care with them.</p>
      <p sl="es">The summit held last week with Morocco was the first summit with an Arab country, and also symbolised advanced status being granted to Morocco. I would have liked you to have attended, Baroness Ashton. I also regret that the King of Morocco was not present. His absence meant that a summit that should have been historic lost political influence, significance and effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the Union for the Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona will also be successful in terms of the level of the delegations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also regret the fact that the summit with President Obama planned for the spring is not going to take place. As the Albertini report states, the Treaty of Lisbon sets the stage for strengthening our mechanisms for dialogue with the United States. This and other subjects could have been dealt with at the summit.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union and the United States should not miss the opportunity to deal at a high level with the bilateral matters, conflicts and global challenges that are now mounting up on the world’s agenda. It would be paradoxical – and I will finish now – if now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ran the risk of becoming irrelevant in this world that some are now calling ‘post-Western’ or ‘post-American’.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, in my speech, I would like to point out the need to create a partnership with Russia. The EU States and Russia face many common challenges and threats. I could mention the fight against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts in the Middle East and Afghanistan, climate change, energy security including nuclear security, and so on. Neither the European Union nor Russia can solve these problems alone. Cooperation is necessary and cooperation should be the basis for a new comprehensive agreement between the EU and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would therefore like to call on the High Representative to make use of her new powers and to speed up the negotiations with Russia. I would also like to ask you, Baroness, to make use of your new powers to coordinate more effectively the positions of individual Member States, as well as of the individual parties involved within out common foreign and security policy, because that is the only way we will be able to secure a unified approach and to promote values such as human rights, democracy, the legal state, equality and even-handedness in mutual relations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome and support both reports and I congratulate both rapporteurs on those documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now for two points. Firstly, on the Danjean report, I would like to bring up an issue that has raised a lot of eyebrows in a number of EU Member States. I am talking specifically about the exclusive talks between Paris and Moscow over the possible sale of four Mistral warships to Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Mistral warship is clearly offensive in nature and it is indeed very alarming that some EU Member States are engaging in arms sales to third countries which might have very negative consequences for the security of other EU Member States or the EU’s neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Treaty of Lisbon outlines common defence aspirations and includes a clause about solidarity in the area of security and defence. Therefore, what do you reckon Parliament and other EU institutions should push for? A common set of rules inside the EU addressing arms sales from EU Member States to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards Mr Albertini’s report, I would like to stress the importance of stability and security in East Asia. We welcome the efforts undertaken by both Taipei and Beijing to improve cross-state relations and to enhance dialogue and practical cooperation. In this context, the EU should strongly back Taiwan’s participation in the International Civil Aviation Organisation and in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as Taiwan’s participation in these organisations is important to the EU and global interests.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam High Representative, I very much agree with you when you say that your key objective is a better and a more credible European foreign policy. That greater stability and security in the Balkans, our part of the world, is your key objective.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We really cannot afford any failure in this regard. I therefore recommend that you commit to two issues: firstly, to resolving urgently the relations between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, so that our Member State Greece can finally begin to breathe easy with regard to its northern borders; and secondly, to making efforts to ensure that Serbia, in the artificial dilemma of having to choose between the European Union and Kosovo, opts for the European Union, i.e. that it does not isolate itself. Perhaps it might be a good idea to remind our friends in Serbia of one important fact, which is that Serbia and Kosovo will be together again once they both become members of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Madam Vice-President, today you are sitting on the other side. If you switch round every month, that will be fine by me.</p>
      <p sl="de">As this debate draws to a close, a number of primary evaluations have become clear. We want you to be at the head of an External Action Service in which you – as a fellow Member said earlier – wear both hats at the same time. These two hats should be the only duplication, though – duplication in the structures is not something that we need. The retention of the Community method must be ensured, not only in relation to the budget and EP supervision. To be quite clear about this, the new service must not be the exclusive toy of the Foreign Ministers, who feel insulted that they will no longer be included in the European Council. The same applies to the appointment of the staff and the filling of important positions within the service.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the Danjean report, I would like to give my full support to the line taken by the rapporteur. When it comes to the permanent operations centre, like Mr Van Orden, I have noticed that Baroness Ashton has moved on this issue since her hearing and, I must say, in the right direction, too, as I see it. You have moved from rejection to a test phase. I still believe that, if we are to operate civilian and military mission planning in a fully integrated way in the External Action Service, it makes sense to also run that service from its own operational headquarters.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the proposal from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to establish a Directorate-General for peace-building, I would say that, in contrast to my fellow Members who sit at the left-most edge of this Chamber, I believe the entire EU project, and specifically also our foreign policy, is a unique peace-building project. On that basis, I am not sure that we should be restricting this to a single department.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we believe that the new institutions need some time to establish themselves, but we also believe that we should not take our eye off the ball. What is important is not, as some are asking, for the High Representative to be present wherever the European foreign policy is involved. What is important is for the European Union to be present on the international stage with the capacity to speak out in defence of its positions. This is what the reports are saying that we are debating today.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore advocate a broad European Union policy on cooperation relations with all the countries with which we have interests, especially in terms of human rights, from Belarus to Cuba. We should have this policy for all countries in which we have an interest in terms of human rights, security and global challenges, because the European Union can make the difference, as has been shown with the joint position of the majority of the Member States achieved under the Spanish Presidency in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, and as must be achieved on the Middle East and on Cuba. This is a proactive and reformist step forward in terms of the external action of the European Union. We want a strong, genuine European External Action Service that supports the work of the High Representative and also responds to Parliament’s aspirations.</p>

Our discussion, today, about the Common Security and Defence Policy, is based on the excellent report of my boss on the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, Mr Danjean. The Union must, of course, build the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy. There are many challenges ahead of us, not only conflicts, but also natural disasters, the threat of terrorism and so on. We must, therefore, strengthen our operational capabilities. The Union must take care of its own security, but must also be active in the face of global challenges. This cannot be done without good cooperation with our allies from across the Atlantic. I think that, not just because most EU Member States belong to NATO, but because of those challenges, in fact, everyone expects that you will manage to initiate a good dialogue and build coherent cooperation between the European Union and NATO.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Arnaud Danjean on this report, which is comprehensive and, at the same time, thoughtful on each individual question; for my part, I wish to speak on one point only. There are many countries among the Member States of the European Union, including my homeland, Hungary, which would like to play an active role, as full and equal members, in cooperating on European security and defence policy. At the same time, for well-known historical reasons, neither their material resources nor their capacity or even knowledge base allows them, for now, to be on the same footing as the largest countries. I therefore voted for those proposed amendments that seek to facilitate this sort of participation and catching up. On the one hand, this concerns ongoing structural cooperation, which may be and could perhaps have been formulated in such a way that it does not turn into an elite club of the strongest and the largest Member States, in other words, that it does not make unified and uniform demands on each participant, because in this case, certain countries will be left out, but instead, enables the smaller countries to take part according to their specialised abilities. On the other hand, the training networks need to be developed in this regard. I would like to thank the President for including these points in the report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mrs Ashton, I speak, probably, for everyone present in this Chamber, when I say that foreign policy is one of the most important challenges before the European Union, and we would hope that, under your leadership, Mrs Ashton, the European Union will be a genuine regulator of foreign policy at world level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I will concentrate on two areas. The first is the political situation in the Middle East. We expect a clear position from you on strategy relating to the fight against terrorism. We expect, chiefly, that the situation, especially in Afghanistan, will be a situation from which it will be possible to withdraw. I would like, here, to suggest the use of all means, including, mainly civilian operations, as part of efforts to modernise a country which is, today, in ruins after 30 years of permanent war. I think, too, that political involvement in the rebuilding of Afghanistan is a key factor for stabilisation in the country. The second area is Iran which, today, is playing a key role in foreign policy in the region. I think that engagement in the fight to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons is a crucial task which also falls to you. We wish you great success here and trust that you will be able to coordinate your work well with American policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think the political situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Iran is crucial from the point of view of world security policy. Therefore, Mrs Ashton, your role in this is invaluable.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, you have described Operation Atalanta in the Horn of Africa to combat piracy as a success.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, last week, there was a massive pirate attack on Basque, Spanish and French fishing boats, which forced the fishing fleet to leave the area and withdraw to places where they can be protected, but where there are no fish, not forgetting the hundreds of people who are still held hostage on various boats.</p>
      <p sl="es">I ask you to apply the resolution that Parliament adopted in December for this Operation to protect fishing boats and to extend that protection. I also call for the strategies to be reconsidered, and for the techniques used by this Operation in the Indian Ocean to be reviewed urgently, along with how it is present there.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, 58 people lost their lives on Sunday trying to exercise their right to vote in the Iraqi elections, and 140 were seriously injured. However, violence, intimidation, threats of attack and blackmail did not deter millions of courageous Iraqis from going to the polls.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been repeated attempts to manipulate and distort the outcome of the election. The banning of more than 500 secular non-sectarian candidates by the bogus Accountability and Justice Commission, the repeated bomb attacks on polling day, and the deeply sinister delay in announcing the results, are all disturbing signs of dirty tricks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ominous interference of Iran has been a constant feature of this election, and we must today send it this stark warning: do not try to install a puppet prime minister in Iraq, do not try to defraud the Iraqi people of their democratic rights and do not plunge Iraq back into sectarian chaos, because the West is watching you, and you are under the spotlight.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Baroness Ashton’s role is described in Article 18 of the Treaty on European Union as contributing to the development of a common foreign and security policy, as mandated by the Council, which, of course, contains the representatives of nation states. However, the same article states that she must be a Vice-President of the Commission, from which she operates. Furthermore, I understand that former Commission staff will be given preference over the staff of diplomatic and foreign ministries when staff are appointed to the External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="en">Baroness Ashton, it is clear that your role was designed to undermine continually the influence over foreign policy by Member States, not only individually, but also collectively on the Council. You and your successors will be mandated by the Council only on paper. The real driving force behind the EU’s foreign policy will be the Commission; Member States and the Council will be continually marginalised.</p>

      <p sl="pl">A coherent and effective policy is the main message of Mr Albertini’s report. I congratulate him on this report, as I do Mr Danjean. I would like to point out that there is also the personnel aspect to carrying out this work. The European External Action Service appears in the report, and despite the fact that this concerns the year 2008 – it is a pity that it is not, already, about 2009 – it is, here, a kind of marker which will be a measure of how, in fact, we carry out the work which now falls to the service headed by Mrs Ashton. I think the geographical balance we are demanding, as well as roles in this process for the European Parliament and national parliaments, seem to me to be extremely important, here. Clear recruitment criteria and a role for the European Parliament in developing the service are matters which are going to be the subject of careful evaluation in this Chamber. We would like to appeal for this process to be clear and plain, so that it will be understandable to us as the representatives of the individual voters who, after all, make up the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I would remind you of a tragic event which took place in Belgrade on 12 March seven years ago. I am referring to the murder of Zoran Đinđić, former Prime Minister of Serbia. They killed him in order to stop the normalisation, democratisation and Europeanisation of Serbia. However, they have not stopped it. All they did was delay it. This event has also had a negative impact on the neighbouring countries and the region as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Mrs Ashton, I would ask you to help and encourage pro-European forces everywhere in our immediate vicinity. You will need to act in a timely and preventative manner. You have chosen for yourself a new institution and a new role, which are essentially two roles in two institutions, and you are becoming a double figurehead, as it were. There is no going back, either for you or for us. As you can only go forwards, I ask that you justify the confidence we have placed in you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, comprehensive reports usually require differentiated evaluations, and this is true in this case, too. Thus, I am in favour of a common foreign and security policy that deals with illegal immigration, visa fraud, criminal tourism and bogus asylum claims. I am also in favour of a common foreign and security policy that deals with securing the borders of the Schengen area and clearly taking the bit between the teeth in the fight against organised crime. However, I am critical of, and opposed to, a common foreign and security policy that is designed to give the EU an active role in military issues, where the UN and NATO are already in place. This duplication should be rejected – and, of course, I speak from the special position of being a representative of a neutral State. I also reject the lifting of the visa requirement, an ill-considered lifting of the requirement for Balkan States whereby already, after a few months, around 150 000 Macedonians are en route to central Europe, two thirds of whom have already disappeared into illegality.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is certainly no way to further the security needs of European citizens – it makes no contribution to security and it also, of course, does nothing to increase our citizens’ desire for more Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I am concerned that the previous conferences have not produced tangible results in the area of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such weapons and technologies have been proliferating. There is a growing risk of nuclear technology falling into the hands of criminal and terrorist organisations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Union should act jointly in this area and take a stand on the issue as a world player, to strengthen all three pillars of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and to achieve universal application and enforcement of the rules and instruments for non-proliferation. I consider it necessary to include the issue of nuclear non-proliferation among the European Union’s priorities and to start a constructive dialogue with all the nuclear powers, not just the USA and Russia. The number of countries which have nuclear weapons is not just the five members of the United Nations Security Council. The Union should, therefore, in the interests of global security, make a political and diplomatic effort to ensure that countries such as Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea become signatories to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like first of all to express my thanks for the contributions that have been made and say how much I thought this was an important and valuable debate in terms of our strategic direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say at the beginning that I agree completely with all honourable Members who spoke of the value and importance of the scrutiny of this House and the role of this House, not only in terms of that scrutiny, but also in terms of the expertise that I know exists within it. It is my intention to call upon that expertise and to hope to have as many occasions as possible where we are able to debate and discuss many if not all the important issues that have been raised today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will be relatively brief at this point but I will just try to talk about a few of the key areas that I think honourable Members are most concerned about. I shall begin by saying that I did not say ‘no’ to the Barnier report. What I said was, on the basis of lessons learnt from Haiti and now the support we are offering in Chile, we wanted to look at how much more we could do, how we could operate more effectively, what we should have on standby and whether we should have something on standby. That requires us to consider strategically what we should be doing, and the Barnier report provides the backdrop to do that. I am very grateful to Michel for the contribution that he has made on that – it is the backdrop.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Non-proliferation Treaty: a number of honourable Members have raised the importance of the conference that is coming up in May, all of which I agree with. It is very important that we move forward now in terms of what the opportunity of May will afford us.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree that security begins with strong political relations. We have to consistently view our approach in the wider world as being about developing those strong political relationships in order to promote security, not only for ourselves but also for third states, for states with whom we are seeking to have that relationship or with whom we are in dialogue because of the concerns that we have.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of honourable Members quite rightly raised the importance of the Balkans. I have indicated in my priorities that this is an incredibly important area of work. It is very important in the period building up to the elections in Bosnia that we promote the importance of the European Union and make sure that national politicians describe to their people the path that they plan to take to get closer ties with Europe and ultimately to become part of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree on the importance of Valentin Inzko and the work he is doing in the Office of the High Representative. He and I are working together to think about the strategic approach – again for a future that takes us way beyond the elections to where we need to be in the coming months and years in order to retain the security. I take the point about the importance of stability: not only do we have to have it there, but we need to keep it there. There is concern in the region that we are seen to be moving forward and, on occasions, I feel we have got a bit stuck in what we need to do next. We need to take that forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is particularly true, as a number of honourable Members have said, in Kosovo, where I have met the government. I have had conversations with the government and with the Prime Minister in particular, to look at what we would do with them in the future. Then there is Serbia, which is pushing very hard to become a part of the European Union. When I met President Tadić and the government members, it was very clear there, too, that this is something they see as being their future, and they too understand the issues that we are concerned about on that journey.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the debate on Cuba, I would have been there. It is simply that we have a clash. There is the Council of Presidents meeting to discuss the External Action Service and I cannot be in two places at once. That is what the European Parliament decided in terms of timing. I must obey and be present at that. However, I think Cuba is an important issue and I have no doubt that we will return to that subject.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the separate department for peace-building, my response is that it should be in everything we do and I am always nervous about separating out something, as if somehow it is separate from every bit of work we are doing. If you look at how we are going to operate the External Action Service, it is like an umbrella organisation that takes in clearly the responsibilities under the treaty but which is also your servant and the Commission’s servant.</p>
      <p sl="en">So when the Commission is looking to do things on trade, on climate change, on energy security across the world, the External Action Service can be its tool as well, directly linking the work of the Commission to what happens on the ground. All of that, I would maintain, is about a more secure, more stable world. So for me, it is all about how we build in the idea that we are there to support efforts to ensure that we have peace and that we keep peace.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Atalanta: I think the points made there are very positive. It is a very important mission, but it is a mission that has to be connected to all the other things we are doing in that region. I also take the point that we need to think about fishing and the strategy on that. That is very much understood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Working groups: I think it is a very good idea for Parliament to have them. I think senior officials are linking with them well at the moment and we need to continue to do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the operational headquarters: it is not that I have changed my position. What I said in January was that I remain to be convinced. We have now been looking at this, because, as I have been in the job a little bit longer, I am more engaged in the work that we are doing in terms of our missions abroad, whether in Kosovo, whether in Bosnia or whether in discussing what we are doing in Atalanta or indeed, what we have just been doing in Haiti, and so forth.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my speech, I said that we need to look at what is necessary and then decide how best to achieve it. There are different views, but those views, I believe, will converge around a common theme, and that is what we ought to do. So it is about being convinced one way or the other as to how we do it.</p>
      <p sl="en">On human rights: I want to describe that as a silver thread. The projection of our values and human rights is essential to everything that we do in the European Union and in the wider world. It is about how we make sure that it is a thread that runs all the way through all our actions in terms of support for the work that we are doing across the world to promote the values of the European Union. I want to look very carefully at how we do that, so it is not something that just becomes an add-on extra to a dialogue. It becomes an integral part of everything that we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree as well about the strong relationship transatlantically with the United States. They are a strong partner with us on a whole range of things, particularly on crisis management, and it is very important that we build on that. I am also very keen to build on the work that we do with the US in areas of development, for example, particularly in Africa, where there is a potential – I believe, anyway – to do a lot more, certainly in the light of my experience with Aid for Trade as the Trade Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to think about other big partnerships. I have been talking to the Brazilian Foreign Minister about the potential of again working together on development where the economies of scale and the ability to collaborate enable us to release resources in a much more effective way to certain parts of the world which are in real need.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree too on the cyber threats. This is a very important issue. It is here now. It is an issue we are going to have to keep looking at because inevitably, the threats change all the time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just a little bit on the External Action Service. The geographical breadth of the European Union has to be represented within the External Action Service. I agree with that completely, but it will take me time to do it. One of the things that I have said to all the foreign ministers and I say to Parliament is: please resist the temptation to assume that, because the first four or five appointments I make are not from a Member State that you might know best, it does not mean that I will not make appointments in the future from those Member States. We simply have to build it stage by stage. Remember, as honourable Members know, it does not exist at all at the moment. I do not have a team or a staff for the External Action Service because, until the legal basis is done, we do not have anything. We simply have what we had before, trying to bring it together in a more coherent way.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will appoint on merit and nothing else. There are no favourites here. It is on merit. I want the brightest and the best and that is what I have said to Member States and the institutions. I want the delegations on the ground to be an umbrella, able to support the work of the European Union in all its different elements, as it is represented to third countries, as it works with third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential that it does that as otherwise, we will end up fragmented again. The question is how to do it, and that is why we are in dialogue with the Council and the Commission at the moment. If it were very simple, we would have done it by now. We just have to make sure that we do it properly and effectively. We will work that out in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of resources, I am going to argue for flexibility. I am going to argue that, if you have a crisis in a particular country or if you realise that you need to be able to move resources, we should deal with it, but deal with it within the context of parliamentary scrutiny. And again, we need to think about how to make that work, not just now but in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">We absolutely must avoid duplication; otherwise we will have gained nothing except more bureaucracy, which is not what we want to do. We have to make sure that this is a cohesive service that runs well, operating as an entity within the European Union, supporting and being supported by the other institutions. And, as I have said, we must remember that it does not exist yet. Let us hope that we can get the work done in the next few weeks. With Parliament supporting me, I am sure we will, so we can get this into being. We can lay the foundation stones but it will take time to build it, and that is so important that I hope that every honourable Member will understand.</p>
      <p sl="en">A couple of final points. On summits: we have lots of different summits. The question that we always have to keep in mind is the value and importance of them. I cannot go to all of them. There are simply too many. I will be at some. We were well represented at the Morocco Summit because both Presidents were there. I honestly believe that if the Presidents of the Council and the Commission are there, we have to start saying that is a strong EU representation at the summit. It does not always require me to be there as well, and they would agree with that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, honourable Members talked about relationships with countries like Japan, with countries important to us in strategic partnership like Russia, the importance and value of the Middle East, where I will be travelling from Sunday onwards, and the importance and value of the Quartet, because I will travel through the Middle East. I think I visit five countries and then I will end up in Moscow for the Quartet meeting in order to discuss and debate what we do next.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, honourable Members, thank you for noticing I am on the Council side and there is no Commission. I will change sides. Until there is a seat in the middle, I will keep moving across. It will be your responsibility to remember which side I should be on as I come in.</p>
      <p sl="en">And, finally can I again thank Mr Albertini and Mr Danjean very much for excellent reports which have given me the opportunity to put forward my views today.</p>

      <p sl="it">I thank my fellow Members, so many of whom have spoken, especially those who approved the key parts of the report, praising and endorsing its content, but also those who expressed criticisms and who, above all, did so in a desire to overcome the regrettably tragic instances where force has been used, and to dream of a peaceful world. A great Greek philosopher, Plato, said that only the dead will see an end to war. However, despite our refusal to bow to this philosophy and our attempts to prevent this happening, reality compels us to use force even on peace missions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I congratulate High Representative/Vice-President Ashton, and thank her for having mentioned my report: one aspect of her approach that I particularly like is its dual nature, the way it seeks synergy between the tasks of the Council and the Commission. Her very physical location – which will alternate between the benches of the Council, here, and the Commission – exemplifies her wish to wear two hats.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Parliament, I believe that we must support and promote this synergistic commitment. The European Commission pursues policies for development, neighbourhood, and for stability and the promotion of human rights and democracy; the Council undertakes peace missions and missions to implement the rule of law. This set of themes must find its ultimate expression in the European foreign diplomatic service, which must be efficient, effective, and equipped with the necessary skills and resources to be able to carry out its role as it should, and we will work hard to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also thank the High Representative – and we will discuss this further on 23 April – for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the subject of the external service, which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth. Today marks the beginning of our collaboration, but certainly not the end.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for all the speeches which, once again, have helped to enrich the debate, to enrich this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to reassure those who have voiced their doubts and, at times, their suspicions, about the fact that this report might open the door to more competition, with NATO in particular, and even to isolation. This is by no means the case; I absolutely do not believe that, and I would add that this does not appear in the treaty, quite the opposite. You can believe a French MEP who has fought tirelessly to have his country reinstated within the integrated structures of NATO.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we talk about strategic autonomy, what idea are we developing, what policy have we been developing, for 10 years? The answer is the ability of the European Union to intervene via civil and military missions in areas in which other organisations, including NATO, cannot. NATO could not have intervened to put a stop to the conflict in Georgia, where there is no UN or OSCE presence. NATO intervened no earlier than we did in the Horn of Africa to put a stop to events threatening our security interests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Strategic autonomy also means the ability to intervene with a range of instruments that we alone possess: civil and military instruments, legal instruments, financial instruments, development instruments. The European Union is best placed to develop this global approach in crisis areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our strategic autonomy also refers to our ability, where necessary, not to intervene, either in unilateral military campaigns, or – and this has been pointed out by several Austrian Members – because there are neutral countries among us and because we respect their status.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is what is meant by European defence and security. This is what is meant by the strategic autonomy that we are developing by means of this policy. Never forget the origins of this European Security and Defence Policy. It originates in a tragic, bloody failure: that of the Balkans in the 1990s, where the European Union was incapable of coping with a major security challenge on its own continent. Let us not forget that. Our European citizens have not forgotten it, and they would not forgive us if we abandoned the ambition to see Europe play a role on the international stage.</p>

Last week, the European Commission announced funding for 43 major energy projects, including four involving Romania. In the future, the Commission must give due importance to the pan-European Constanţa-Trieste oil pipeline, as well as to the development of relations with the countries in the Eastern Partnership. Efforts must also be stepped up in implementing projects as part of the Black Sea Synergy in order to ensure more effective cooperation in this area. The Republic of Moldova can play an important role in both the Eastern Partnership and Black Sea Synergy. The European Union must focus particular attention on relations with this country and support it on its journey to EU accession. The EU must have greater involvement in settling unresolved conflicts in the Black Sea region, including the conflict in Transnistria. The development of the transatlantic partnership must be a priority in the European Union’s foreign and security policy. Relations with the United States are extremely important in helping consolidate global security and stability. Installation of part of the US anti-missile system on Romanian territory is proof of the confidence placed in my country.</p>

It is important that the Member States of the European Union present a unified standpoint at that meeting and that they reaffirm all three pillars of the Treaty: non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, disarmament and cooperation on the civilian uses of nuclear energy. Member States must express their commitment to eliminating trade in nuclear weapons, progressively reducing the existing nuclear weapons stockpile and strictly monitoring the manufacture of materials needed for the production of nuclear weapons and the possession of products required for their production. Member States must take a leading role in applying United Nations Security Council Resolution 1887, adopted in autumn 2009 (on 24 September). Within the meaning of this resolution, Member States must place great emphasis on developing a comprehensive international agreement regulating the elimination of nuclear weapons under strict international supervision. In addition, they need to strive to introduce two concrete measures in the aforementioned areas, in order to set an example for the rest of the world. The EU Member States must promote the comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the renewal of the START Agreement between the United States and Russia. The EU must treat endeavours relating to nuclear fuel as a priority area and focus on harmonising, tightening and rendering transparent the regulations concerning their storage, transport and trade.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I suspect the annual report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy for 2008 will not arouse such emotion as will our debate on the subject next year. For I hope that in a year’s time, we will know what the European External Action Service looks like, and this new service is, in turn, going to have a huge influence on the development of European foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union has ambitions of being a global player. This is good, but those ambitions are not going to be easy to achieve. We have some hard work ahead of us. The European institutions must come to an understanding on the EEAS. This will not be easy, but without it we will not be able to improve foreign policy. We should go back to the fundamental values of the European Union, and use them as a basis on which to build our foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must always remember about solidarity, equality, uniform standards and human and civil rights. We must remember to maintain internal balance, and that we should defend those interests of all EU Member States which are not mutually exclusive. A key matter is, definitely, the need to improve coordination between Community institutions and Member States. Particular national interests should not conflict with our coherence or our community. Paradoxically, even those countries which want to be seen as a driving force for European integration sometimes act against the collective interests of the Union. Let us change this.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, some previous speakers have pointed out problems relating to the composition of the European External Action Service, which has begun work following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. I consider it extremely important to adhere to the principle of geographic equality in making up the EEAS and, as with other European Union bodies, to implement positive discrimination in relation to representatives from the new Member States, which is reflected in the transition period and which makes it possible to speed up career development. Representatives from the new Member States lack the necessary decades-long work experience in the institutions of the European Union, which is a prerequisite for filling the highest offices. It would be unfair if all the most important positions were filled by officials from the old Member States, and if officials from the new Member States had to stand on the sidelines for many years. This would obviously be a waste of resources because, for example, the representative from Malta might have much more know-how with respect to the countries of North Africa, Cyprus with respect to the Middle East, Bulgaria with respect to Turkey, Poland with respect to Belarus and Ukraine, the Baltic States with respect to Russia, and so on. I hope that the European Union will not make the mistake of only allowing the old Member States to make up the face of the EEAS, and I hope that instead, it finds an optimal solution which satisfies all the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The situation in the world is creating new challenges for EU foreign policy and requires a broader understanding of security problems. New powers have arisen and are becoming actively involved in global policy in various areas. Therefore, what is needed is dialogue at world level and the establishment of new principles for cooperation and for the division of roles. We must supplement the enormous role in world security played by NATO and the USA by establishing special mobile forces, as part of the EU, which will be able to tackle all kinds of natural disasters and catastrophes. The Union will not only be perceived as an institution which fights for democracy and human rights, but also as an institution which comes to people’s aid in times of difficulty. The danger from other threats is clearly growing, and so energy and food security are becoming important. I think it is necessary to develop a new conception regarding the functioning of the EU’s external service in which the areas of the Community’s operation and the principles of establishing the service are defined, as well as principles for the division of roles and for cooperation with Member States’ diplomatic services, to make clear what roles are played by individual EU institutions. Failure to elaborate the division of roles and competences at the outset could be the cause of misunderstandings between different institutions and leaders in the Union, as well as between the EU and Member States. Initial experiences with the function of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, and the general expectation that she should be active and present in different places, demand that we think about appointing deputies, or involving other Commissioners in areas of her work to a greater degree, since we have so many of them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the Albertini report outlining the main aspects of the Common Security and Foreign Policy, especially the paragraphs concerning the development of the Eastern Partnership and European policy in the Black Sea region. The Eastern Partnership and the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly provide a suitable framework for bringing the EU’s eastern neighbours closer to European standards, as well as for clarifying certain states’ prospects for joining the EU, such as the Republic of Moldova. I wish to emphasise, in particular, the importance of the rapid, specific assistance which should be given to the Republic of Moldova’s pro-European government. In this regard, two European measures need to be speeded up: the process for granting EU macro-financial assistance and the visa waiver for journeys made to the EU by citizens from the Republic of Moldova. In the Black Sea region, it is vital to continue the European objective of guaranteeing the EU’s energy security. I support paragraph 21 of the report which calls on the EU to implement the Nabucco project fully and as quickly as possible. Another issue during this debate, which is just as important, is a suitable assessment of the development of the US anti-missile defence project and its importance to European security. Romania’s involvement in this project shows that Romania has become a net European supplier of security and has the full capacity to honour its security commitments to allies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution, the main threats and challenges which Europe faces have been correctly defined. The problem is that we are not able to respond to them sufficiently, at least not always quickly enough. There are three main weaknesses, and if we could overcome them, we would radically improve the effectiveness of the Common Security and Defence Policy. The first weakness is a lack of determination of all the EU Member States to have a common policy and not just a verbal declaration of its necessity. Secondly – weak coordination of the work of numerous European institutions. There is still no reaction centre at Union level for critical situations. Thirdly, and finally, the military and civil potential which is really at the Union’s disposal, and not just at the disposal of individual Member States, is too small.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Problems with air transport, for example, are now proverbial, and this is of fundamental significance for a rapid reaction in crisis situations. Only progress in these three areas would make the Common Security and Defence Policy more effective.</p>

Now to the matter in hand. Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on a change to the annual accounting responsibilities of micro-entities. This project caused stormy debate at almost all levels, both in European Union and Member State institutions. I am convinced that we must prepare common European Union rules. However, I would like to underline that by reducing the administrative burden on micro-entities, we must not infringe conditions for fair competition in either the internal markets of Member States or the European Union market. I think that a single tax should be created for micro-entities, which already exists in some states. If it could be calculated, it could be calculated either on the basis of the number of employees or turnover or territory, depending on the type of business. As a result, those companies would no longer be tempted to engage in illegal activities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, with the option of relieving micro-enterprises of the obligation to produce annual balance sheets, the European Parliament is clearly coming out in favour of the abolition of superfluous bureaucracy. With an EU-wide relief of approximately EUR 6.3 billion, we are also providing a tangible stimulus towards growth in Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprise sector. Since the Member States are able to decide individually about this exemption from the obligation to produce annual balance sheets, I expect that as many countries as possible, especially Germany, will make use of this option. This arrangement will not only enable the enterprises in question to save time and costs amounting to around EUR 2 000 per company; it is also a very good example of how Europe is more citizen-friendly than many people believe it to be. It would be nice if this example in this Chamber could be followed by many further examples.</p>

Keeping accounts is actually effective and necessary, for the very reason that it allows enterprises to compete on the market and also obtain bank credit, because the quality of management is measured on the basis of accounts for enterprises and micro-enterprises alike.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that we should work instead to help micro-enterprises obtain incentives to cut taxes, enabling young entrepreneurs and family businesses to be truly competitive on the market, and ultimately allowing them to obtain credit from institution, which, until now, have been chiefly concerned with large enterprises as far as I can see.</p>

Of course, in this case, I am by no means talking about such areas as culture, tradition or national heritage. Nevertheless, we must underline that, in economic terms, the European Union market is a common market. Otherwise, it would be the same as if one state had started to apply different conditions to different regions.

Another good feature is the greater emphasis on support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Without the development of such firms, an improvement of the situation in the Union will not be possible. Some people think the strategy says too little about cohesion policy.

      <p sl="hu">I voted against the EU 2020 strategy. I voted against it because it clearly professes faith in neoliberal economic policy. It clearly states that it condemns protectionist economic policy, in other words, the State playing a role in the economy. Yet the financial and economic world crisis has shown that we cannot leave everything up to the markets. Moreover, its imperial conception is clearly evident. It stipulates that rules will enter into force automatically if Member States do not transpose them in time. It seeks to set up a European supervisory authority and, in certain places, it is also clear that it seeks to use binding legal acts to achieve results rather than allowing for autonomous decisions. This is why we voted against.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to say that I, of course, voted in favour of the EU 2020 strategy, because I felt it was important for Parliament to give its opinion. I do, however, have a reservation, which I would like to explain to the House, which is that the wording of paragraph 18 raises doubts about something that is false. That is, something that is not true.</p>
      <p sl="es">It says that the Court of Auditors has criticised the Commission and the Member States when, in fact, the opposite is true. This is because the management of 80% of the Union’s budget has not been criticised; instead, this year, for the first time in 11 years, the Court of Auditors congratulated us and gave us a positive statement of assurance for the slightly more than 33% of the budget managed by the Member States, which is agricultural spending, and because the monitoring system has been improved and now works better.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore think that the wording of paragraph 18 will create a misunderstanding in the public mind that 80% of the budget is poorly managed and that we have been criticised for it. I would like to clarify this for you, ladies and gentlemen, and for the benefit of the European public.</p>

Naturally, the delegation to the European Parliament of the Jobbik Movement for a Better Hungary voted in support of the European Parliament’s resolution on the acceptance and implementation of the Goldstone recommendations and, at the same time, we apologise to the Palestinian victims because the Hungarian Government, shamefully and in diametrical opposition to Hungarian popular opinion, continually adopts a position contrary to the Goldstone report in international fora.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Presumably, this one-sidedness is due to the fact that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Libya and Pakistan presided over the preparation of this report by the competent committee of the United Nations.

      <p sl="fi">I would like to comment on one point. More than 600 Members of the European Parliament quite rightly voted in favour of considering Hamas a terrorist organisation. Despite the fact that we almost unanimously agreed that Hamas is a terrorist organisation, we, or at least the majority, in this House, voted in favour of this report and appeared to approve of the measures contained in it, and of all the 8 000 rockets which Hamas has fired at Israeli civilian centres.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I believe that Israel is under threat, and that is why the country had to defend its civilian population. Given this, it really is a sorry state of affairs that this very biased report went through, albeit by a tiny majority.

Actually, the situation is much more complicated. It seems to me that we should avoid such one-sided, unequivocal judgments. I, personally, have been to a place called Sderot – and I think you have been there, too, Mr President – which has been the target of several hundred missiles fired by Hamas fighters, as Mr Takkula said recently.

One has the eerie feeling, reading the Goldstone report, that one is reading about a violent assault in which the author has neglected to mention that the events took place during a boxing match. They have been stripped of all context.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not saying that Israel should be beyond criticism, nor am I saying that Cast Lead is beyond criticism. Mistakes were made. Israel wants to get to a position where there is a stable Palestinian entity to be a good neighbour, but this policy of degrading infrastructure has retarded that goal.

You cannot vote in favour of a report for which the very mandate was highly controversial – not one single Member State of the European Union had given its backing. A report that equates democratic Israel with a group officially listed by the EU as a terrorist organisation and a report that fails to give reasonable consideration to the deeper causes of the conflict is not one that we can vote in favour of.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our voting choice does not mean, however, that we would reject an investigation into the events connected with Operation Cast Lead. The opposite is the case, in fact. Israel should indeed thoroughly investigate all aspects of the operation, and if violations of the law did take place, they must be punished. Our voting choice likewise does not mean that we would endorse the policy of the government of the State of Israel in the peace process. We have been very pleased to see signs that talks are again taking place between Israel and the Palestinians, albeit indirectly for the time being.</p>

      <p sl="en">One of the things that is very important when we look at GSP and GSP+ is that, during the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements, there were many individual states in the proposed regions that were against signing a deal with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the things I have always criticised in the economic partnership agreements is that they take a one-size-fits-all approach to trade. What was also alarming, during the debate with the Commission, was that one of the officials announced that the economic partnership agreements were not only about trade but also about exporting the EU’s model of regional integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are individual countries that want to have agreements with the EU and want to be able to export their goods and services to us on a preferential basis. Therefore, what we should propose is to offer those countries that want a trade agreement, but do not fit the criteria of the economic partnership agreements, GSP+ as an alternative, and we should look to be more flexible.</p>

In Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia, we have seen the rise of regimes which, if not exactly dictatorial, are certainly not supportive of parliamentary democracy – people who, although legitimately elected, then set about dismantling every check on their power: the Electoral Commission, the Supreme Court, the Chambers of their Parliament and, in many cases, dissolving their constitutions and rewriting – ‘refounding’, as they call it – their states along socialist principles.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The adoption of this report by a large majority indicates the concern we need to have for small and medium-sized enterprises. At the moment, 5.4 million micro-enterprises are obliged to compile annual reports, even though their area of activity is limited to a particular local area or region. If these companies are not involved in cross-border activities or do not even operate at national level, this reporting obligation only serves to create a pointless administrative burden, thereby incurring costs for these commercial companies (approximately EUR 1 170).</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why this report is recommending that Member States waive the annual reporting obligations for commercial companies which meet two of the following criteria for consideration as micro-enterprises: total assets must be less than EUR 500 000, the net turnover amount must be less than EUR 1 million and/or they must have an average of 10 employees throughout the financial year. Micro-enterprises will obviously continue to keep accounting records, in accordance with the national laws of each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="ro">During the current crisis which Europe is going through, the private sector made up of small and medium-sized companies (including, therefore, micro-enterprises) must be encouraged, while also being regarded, in this difficult climate, as an area for absorbing the workforce made redundant by the state or private corporate sector.</p>

I am, of course, hugely in favour of reducing the administrative burdens for businesses, in particular, for SMEs and very small enterprises. However, the Commission proposal cruelly misses the mark: firstly, it is not clear whether the proposed system would really reduce the administrative burden on these businesses (the statistical data currently compiled will have to be gathered by other means) and, secondly, this text, which leaves it up to each Member State to decide whether or not to apply the exemption, is in danger of fragmenting the internal market (in the highly likely event that some Member States will apply the exemption and others will not). This proposal should have been withdrawn and consideration given to the issue of simplifying the administrative burdens on these small enterprises (company law, simplifying the requirements of financial reports, accounting, auditing and so on) as part of the overall review of the fourth and seventh Company Law Directives, planned for the near future.

This is because the activities of micro-enterprises are confined to single local or regional markets in which the production of annual accounts becomes an onerous and complex undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I do not support the idea of exempting micro-enterprises from the duty to submit annual accounts.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament’s adoption of the Small Business Act in March 2009 kick-started a series of policy proposals geared towards making the business environment in Europe more SME-friendly, through administrative simplification, among other means. The abolition of the accounting system for what have been termed ‘micro-entities’ appears, at first glance, to be a major act of administrative simplification, but, given the importance of financial information to all stakeholders, including lenders, tax administrations and trading partners, this will, on the contrary, actually open the door to more red tape and higher costs. In addition, companies will be denied a useful tool for internal business succession.</p>

The EU has made a commitment to reduce burdens on small and medium enterprises by 25% by 2012 and this law is a vitally important step along the path to achieving this objective.

Economically and socially speaking, it does not make sense for a very small enterprise to be subject to the same administrative constraints as much larger enterprises. Very small enterprises account for more than 85% of European businesses; in other words, they are the backbone of our economy, which urgently needs a boost. I therefore believe that a harmonised reduction in their obligations is along the right lines, albeit with an assurance that this will not hinder their access to credit. The assessment should therefore be carried out across the board, with account taken of the whole economic environment that surrounds very small enterprises, their relations with banks, with management centres – in the case of French enterprises – and, of course, with their customers.

Let us hope that the rules proposed in this report will lead to higher turnover and greater competitiveness for micro-enterprises. This report still gives Member States the flexibility to transpose the directive at the most appropriate time so as to avoid any difficulty that may arise from the reduction of regulation. However, micro-enterprises will be able to continue to draw up annual accounts on a voluntary basis, submit them to auditing and send them to the national register. In any case, micro-enterprises will continue to maintain their sales and transactions registers for the purposes of administration and tax information. The Commission forecasts total savings of between EUR 5.9 and EUR 6.9 billion for the 5 941 844 micro-enterprises if all Member States adopt this exemption.

      <p sl="lt">Huge unemployment in Europe is the most important issue in current discussions, as Member States face ever rising unemployment with more than 23 million men and women without work and, as a result, there are great social and living difficulties. Therefore, most attention in this European Parliament resolution is paid to the creation of new jobs and to combating social isolation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Moreover, Parliament calls on the Commission to not just take into account unemployment and social problems, but to show effective means of solving these, so that this new strategy has a genuine impact on people’s real lives. I would like to draw attention to the fact that Europe has already learnt from its mistakes, having been unable to fully implement the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy earlier. Therefore, the new strategy for the coming decade must be based on a strong management system and it must ensure responsibility. Consequently, by voting for this resolution today, I am calling on the Commission and the European Council to concentrate on Europe’s main social problems and to set out fewer, but clearer and more realistic goals, which it would then be possible to realise.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I welcome the recent debates held during the Informal Council of 11 February on the guidelines for EUROPE 2020, the new strategy for Europe. I congratulate the Commission on its initiative and call for greater cooperation with Parliament on such an important matter for the future of Europe. It is essential to invest in knowledge and in reforms that foster technological progress, innovation, education and training to promote prosperity, growth and employment in the medium and long term. I would also like to highlight the importance of concrete ideas for this strategy such as the digital agenda. It is essential to make the most of this potential so that Europe may recover from the economic crisis in a sustainable way. The cohesion policy is equally important in supporting growth and employment. EUROPE 2020, in its regional dimension should, therefore, include this priority as one of the pillars for a richer, more prosperous and fairer society. I appeal to the need to develop mechanisms of financing and governing with practical effects for the accomplishment of this strategy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">There were high hopes for the Lisbon Strategy, the economic, social and environmental objectives of which were as necessary as they were ambitious. The strategy that succeeds it, the so-called EU 2020 strategy, which we voted on today, seems to me to be far less ambitious. Although it does retain some objectives to be achieved, such as the 3% of GDP to be devoted to research, and the preservation of the Stability and Growth Pact (3%), it is still regrettable that employment and the environmental dimension (which is much reduced) do not occupy a horizontal place in it. We are still a very long way away from a true, global sustainable development strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I supported this proposal because it is very clear that, in the face of the crisis and its many consequences, especially for employment, we cannot continue to stand idly by. I welcome the adoption of the paragraphs relating to an ambitious social agenda and to improving support for SMEs. In short, a new lease of life is needed. Let us hope that the EU 2020 strategy will provide it. Above all, let us hope that the 27 Member States will do their utmost to implement this strategy.</p>

It is, above all, in danger of prolonging the shortcomings, of ending in the same lack of results and of causing the same disappointment. It is neither a true recovery strategy nor a new perspective for the economic, social, budgetary and fiscal policies of the Union. The myriad good intentions are matched only by the absence of new instruments with which to implement them.</p>

The banks are speculating again, hedge funds have not been regulated, the citizens are being asked to tighten their belts, drastic cuts are being made in public services and social protection is being cut back. The Greek crisis serves to reveal our lack of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why Europe must debate a different view of its future, one that is based on true economic coordination, a recovery characterised by solidarity, a green growth strategy, an energy community, a cohesion budget, own resources, investment in education, research, fiscal and social harmonisation, the fight against tax havens and the taxation of international financial transactions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">These are, in fact, areas which are fundamental if Europe is to overcome the crisis and reaffirm its role as an important player in the global market, with a high level of development and a competitive economy which is capable of generating wealth, employment and innovation. The European Union does indeed require ambition to defeat the challenges presented by the crisis, but that ambition must not cause problems for the effort at budgetary consolidation which is being demanded of Member States, in view of the weakness of their public accounts and their excessive deficits.

If this were done, it would find that the approaches which it implemented – namely, the liberalisation of important economic sectors and the deregulation and increased flexibility of labour laws – have been the causes of its results in practice: increased unemployment, insecurity, poverty and social exclusion and economic stagnation and recession.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission and Parliament now seek to follow the same approaches. The proposed path is clear and neither the social or environmental rhetoric which it tries to set out are enough to disguise the following: total emphasis on the Single Market, pursuit of liberalisation, commercialisation of more and more aspects of social life, lack of job security, and structural unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The consensus which exists between the Right and Social Democrats regarding these approaches has been made quite clear. In the final analysis, they have together been its faithful protagonists in recent years. This strategy, essentially, is nothing more than the response of two tendencies within a single system to the structural crisis of that system. In following this approach, the strategy will itself be the origin of new and deeper crises. In following this approach, the strategy will inevitably face resistance and be fought by the workers and the people.</p>

The new proposals would have created a new macro-economic framework to promote sustainable development, strengthen internal demand and respect the environment, based on improvements in pay, full employment with rights, and economic and social cohesion.</p>

European Union citizens work less than the Americans or the Japanese (10% fewer hours per year) and retire earlier. Maintaining these gains at the current level is not easy during a crisis, so I am pleased to hear of the decisive measures on the part of the European Council and the European Commission, which aim to establish a comprehensive economic strategy – Europe 2020.</p>

Firstly, what kind of data will be used as the basis for setting national targets for the 27 different European Union Member States? What penalties or rewards await those Member States which, respectively, do or do not comply with the objectives imposed by the strategy? Finally, what role in the whole process has been reserved for the European Parliament since, until now, the Europe 2020 strategy has been a project piloted exclusively by the Council and the Commission?

We should not forget, furthermore, that agriculture supplies 500 million Europeans with high quality food, provides 40 million jobs and is responsible for an annual turnover of approximately EUR 1.3 trillion. The production of renewable energy provides additional jobs and helps to reduce CO2 emissions and the dependence on fossil fuels.

The change of budget priorities suggests a restriction on funds available for the common agricultural policy, which means that, in 2020, agriculture is going to have to be highly efficient or even downright industrial. This means it will be a threat to the environment, and this, in turn, means that the EU would have to depart from the European model of agriculture, which affords particular care to the environment, the landscape, biodiversity, the well-being of animals, sustainable development and the social and cultural values of the rural environment.

The EU 2020 strategy is intended to set new objectives, not only for political action, but also for the way in which we think. In order to make a good recovery from the crisis, we have to create common instruments and mechanisms which will not only eliminate the effects of the current economic crisis, but will also allow us to react appropriately to future crises and even not to permit them at all. The Commission, Parliament and all EU institutions should remember that working for the common good of Europe’s citizens is, for them, a priority. It is the citizens’ problems which are, for us, the most important, and it is the citizens whom we should serve by giving advice, offering help and taking action. In the context of the crisis, problems such as unemployment, poverty and social exclusion are the order of the day. If we want to build a modern, fully innovative, development-based and cohesive Europe, we must guarantee our citizens a sense of security in the future. I am disappointed that, in the original proposals concerning the EU 2020 strategy, agriculture was omitted. Economic reconstruction and realisation of the objectives of environmental policy are included in agricultural policy.

      <p sl="el">The joint motion for a resolution by the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the EU 2020 strategy expresses the joint decision by the political face of capital to use every means to implement the savage attack and anti-grassroots plans of the monopolies against the working classes and workers throughout the EU. The EU 2020 strategy follows on from and extends the anti-grassroots Lisbon Strategy by laying down the strategic objectives and plans of monopoly capital and laying the workers’ fundamental wage and social rights on a Procrustean bed. To be precise, we have: widespread application of the famous ‘flexicurity’, in conjunction with ‘lifelong learning’, ‘training and retraining’ and ‘mobility’ of workers, abolition of collective agreements, shared jobs, drastic wage and pension cuts, an increase in the retirement age and sweeping changes in social insurance, health, welfare and education. It also gives capital massive sums from State coffers in the form of subsidies and incentives for ‘green development’.

I am in love with a Union that takes the real needs of families in the Member States seriously, in strict accordance with national and European competences. However, on reading the EU 2020 strategy and our parliamentary resolution, I find that our ambitions are limited to a shy flirtation with the free market economy. There is no acknowledgement of the citizens’ investment in social cohesion or solidarity between the generations. Should we not change our perspective on labour relations and the creation of the added value from which society as a whole benefits? The Commission is proposing a quantified target for combating poverty. This move will inevitably bring back the creaming-off process, which hardly helps the poorest citizens. The absence of a list of poverty indicators inadvertently demonstrates a lack of understanding of what poverty means. Poverty means much more than simply being out of work, and those who experience extreme poverty on a daily basis are not just looking for a job; they want proper access to existing rights. Europe 2020 should respond to this situation with greater enthusiasm and determination. I abstained.</p>

The Goldstone report itself concludes that the extremely high mortality among civilians, including over 300 children, arose from an Israeli policy of deliberately using disproportionate force contrary to international law. It also concluded that the siege of Gaza is tantamount to collective punishment of the 1.5m population, contrary to international law. It recommends that the State Parties to the Geneva Conventions (which includes Ireland) should prosecute those responsible for these policies and their implementation.

On 26 February 2010, both sides were once again called on by the UN General Assembly to carry out credible investigations and to submit further reports within five months. The Palestinian authorities have now instituted an independent investigative panel, which is very good news. The European Union’s actions on the international stage must be focused on strict compliance with the principles and objectives of the UN charter and of international law. Similarly, compliance with international humanitarian law and the norms of international human rights law by Israel and by the Palestinians is a material prerequisite for the peace process, which is to lead to two States, coexisting in peace and security. With this resolution, the EU is attempting to prompt the attainment of a settled common position on the measures resulting from the report by the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the conflict in Gaza and southern Israel led by Justice Goldstone.

Although, last year, the Lukashenko regime freed political prisoners and has become somewhat milder, the European Union cannot look the other way in the face of the recent human rights violations concerning members of the Union of Poles in Belarus. It is only possible to extend the benefits of the EU’s Eastern Partnership to Belarusian citizens if the Belarusian administration guarantees the human rights and civic freedoms of Belarusians and begins democratic reforms. The concessions made by the regime up to this point have been continually insufficient, and the arrest of the leader of the Union of Poles in Belarus, Angelika Borys, as well as the refusal to allow the movement to be registered and the freezing of its assets, are yet another blow to relations with the European Union. In my opinion, following the continual violation of human rights principles and the rule of law, the European Union has no option but to consider reimposing sanctions on the Belarusian administration.</p>

Several months ago, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Belarusian authorities to end the use of capital punishment on its citizens. Today, once again, we are talking about Belarus, violations of human rights and the principles of civil society. The European Union has opened up to Belarus. We have put the right measures in place, such as inclusion of Belarus in the Eastern Partnership. The trust we have placed in Belarus was supposed to initiate a switch to the tracks of democratisation and respect for civil rights. Unfortunately, this has not happened. In view of this, the European Union must be firm and adopt a stronger position on relations with Belarus, and must take effective action which will guarantee that the rights of minorities will be respected. I hope the present resolution will initiate changes in the desired direction. If this does not happen, I expect a review of the European Union’s approach to Belarus and the imposition of appropriate sanctions. Every ineffective solution will be evidence of our weakness.</p>

The activities of the Belarusian authorities do not meet international standards for the rules governing conduct towards the opposition and non-governmental organisations or standards concerning the protection of national minorities. It is important to find an adept way out of the situation, in which the Union should show its disapproval by specific measures, such as sanctions or visa restrictions, but, at the same time, we must not isolate Belarus from the rest of Europe, because all of Belarusian society will suffer, and not the authorities condemned by the Union.

An FTT could help reduce volatile and risky financial trading while raising billions to help tackle the effects of climate change and help developing countries who have been hit hardest by the financial crisis.

A potential tax on financial transactions could reduce the immense volume of speculation capital that has again had a detrimental impact on the real economy recently, and thus also represent a step towards sustainable growth. However, before we consider introducing such a tax, we must carefully weigh the pros and cons. That process is exactly what the resolution proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution. A crucial point that is only mentioned in passing in the text but that must be clearly defined before a decision is made is the potential use of the capital that could be generated by such a tax. I believe that the tax must be levied where the transaction takes place, and must also, in other words, benefit the States on whose territory the relevant stock exchanges are located. The exact method of calculation still has to be specified. If the EU insists on levying the tax itself, it must, in any case, be offset against the gross contribution of the Member State in question. Under no circumstances may it be allowed to lead to a tax competence on the part of the EU.</p>

European citizens expect the costs of the financial crisis to be borne by those on the financial markets who caused it. We cannot therefore be content with a minimalist solution in line with the US proposal, which would generate a few billion euro – a relatively small revenue considering the huge costs. Poverty reduction, the fight against climate change and tackling the financial crisis require additional revenue of several hundred billion euro. A cleverly designed financial transaction tax would provide such a revenue, while simultaneously curbing speculation on financial markets.</p>

In an age of Internet banking, this will bring about increased competition between banks, and this will benefit clients. Introduction of the SEPA is the next step towards realisation of one of the four fundamental freedoms of the common market – the free movement of capital.

I strongly believe that the ACTA Agreement should not go beyond the framework of the currently valid intellectual property laws and that any penalties for copying digital content should be left to the discretion of individual states. The protection of privacy and the protection of personal data must remain a pillar of European legislation, which will not be undermined by international legal agreements. I am in favour of an ACTA agreement that will combat counterfeiting, which represents a real danger to the economy and the consumer and undoubtedly violates intellectual property rights. On the other hand, copying that is carried out exclusively for one’s own needs should be left out.

For this reason, we believe it to be important that the resolution points out that the Commission ‘has had a legal obligation to inform Parliament immediately and fully at all stages of international negotiations’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Democratic and transparent procedures in the conduct of negotiations are required, as well as public debate on their content, something which we consider to be positive.

However, as is always the case when there is something fundamentally harmful in an agreement negotiated by the Commission, everything is done in secret.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am thinking of the Blair House Agreement, which sacrificed European farming to feed the appetites of the US agri-food multinationals. I am also thinking of the scandalous MAI, the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, which sought to exempt multinationals from the laws in force in the countries in which they were operating. Fortunately, that agreement did not see the light of day. In this instance, it is the ‘Internet’ section of ACTA that is in question: it literally boils down to introducing a monstrous worldwide ‘Hadopi’ law.</p>

Aside from the risk of reintroducing the ‘flexible response’, respect for the fundamental rights of citizens, in terms of freedom of expression and of protection of privacy and data, and the principle of non-liability of Internet access providers and hosts, could be called into question here. It follows that the European Parliament, as the voice of the European peoples, cannot be excluded from these negotiations and must receive the same information as that issued to the Council; this is a democratic requirement. Lastly, ACTA must not compromise access to generic medicines. In this context, considering, at this stage, the method and the worrying rumours circulating about its content, I can only vote in favour of a resolution that is critical of such an agreement.</p>

I voted in favour of the resolution, a specific aim of which is to involve Parliament fully in its revision by 2012.

That is why we demand, before the revision, a report on the current state of ratification, implementation of the conventions, an impact assessment of the effects of the GSP during the period 2006-2009, the inclusion of a condition stipulating that 27 fundamental UN conventions must be implemented, and more transparent investigation processes – involving, in particular, regular consultation of Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is by no means certain to say, as the resolution does, that the current Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is a mechanism to help developing countries. This mechanism has effects which accentuate the economic dependence of these countries as it leads to production for export, to the detriment of their internal market. To a large extent, it is the large transnational companies, some of them from EU countries, which benefit from this system, rather than the people of developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thus, some of the intentions which are supposed to underlie the GSP create a contradiction with its actual results.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, against a backdrop of increasing pressure for the liberalisation of international trade, it is apparent that the EU has been using the aim of this regulation as a form of blackmail to gain acceptance of the aforementioned free trade agreements through an unacceptable level of diplomatic and economic pressure on these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For the GSP to become a mechanism of development aid, there will be a need, as we propose, to abolish and then renegotiate both it and other policies for development assistance, forming an effective solidarity, and combating economic dependency and the exploitation of people and natural resources by economic groups within the EU.</p>

In so doing, however, it does not give any clear specification of objectives or direction to the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). The demand for a stronger financial footing must therefore be rejected, given this context. In future, international engagements should, in fact, be assessed for how sensible they are and their benefit to the EU. Ultimately, a strategy-based approach should be developed in the CFSP. I feel I must roundly oppose the objective of abolishing the principle of unanimity. This is particularly the case if, as has been stated several times, the aim is to have a closer partnership with NATO. The EU must manage to create its own structures, and must, of course, have the necessary resources available for such structures. When it comes to the numerous operations and missions, many of the current 23 different actions in which the EU is involved should be reconsidered. In Afghanistan, in particular, the strategy followed there under the leadership of the United States is to be regarded as a failure.</p>

      <p sl="ro">However, it must be made clear that the EU has exclusive rights in determining the defence and security policy, and the interventions of third states are not justified. The European Union decides how best to guarantee the security of its citizens, which must be done based on a consensus among the Member States, and not at all through the involvement of non-Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU has variously been defined as an economic giant and a political dwarf, and this is supposed to mean that it has not been provided with the means necessary to pursue some of its aims, in particular, in respect of its foreign policy. There have been many instances which have demonstrated the lack of unanimity of will and action amongst the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am doubtful whether this situation can be changed in the short-term. Rather, I believe that this situation is entirely to be expected, given the number of states which make up the Union and their particular histories and interests. The question of common defence policy, something which touches upon the very essence of sovereign powers, has historically always been a matter of distrust for European countries and even today it deserves particular care, and quite justifiably so.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This must not prevent us from searching for deeper cooperation and coordination with the aim of improving our common security and defence. Its nature as a soft power not withstanding, the European Union should consider becoming a true second pillar in an Atlantic alliance which cannot continue to require the US to make all the sacrifices.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Subject to the following remarks, I voted in favour of the Danjean report. 1) The report calls for the abolition of the Assembly of the Western European Union (WEU). One therefore searches in vain for the slightest reference in the report to the work carried out by the Assembly to further European integration. It is too bad for the work of the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs when all day long, elements are praised even though they are often less commendable than the ideas that the Assembly in Paris has so far come up with. 2) Parliamentary control of European defence matters will have to take due account of the contribution of the national parliaments. Indeed, they are the ones on which the decision to make national troops and capabilities available to the EU for EU military operations will depend, and for a long time yet. The same applies to the financing of military operations, which are paid for out of the national budgets. The desire to prevent any democratic deficit in European defence matters should guide us in our search for an institutional solution that is truly acceptable at parliamentary level.</p>

It does not propose any civilian and peaceful focus or solution to the conflicts, focusing instead on defence and the militarisation of the EU. I am also opposed to this text because it refers to the Treaty of Lisbon and its application. This promotes a move towards the centralisation of powers, with no parliamentary control mechanism, which will turn the EU into a military player on the international stage. Instead of permanent, structured cooperation between the EU and NATO, which is what the report advocates, I am in favour of all activities being conducted strictly within the framework of the United Nations Charter and international law, with strict separation between the two institutions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr Danjean’s report into the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the common security and defence policy is very comprehensive and deals with numerous topics that are important for Europe. However, there is a lack of a clear focus on the fundamental shaping of EU foreign policy over the next few years and also a lack of a strict policy line. On the one hand, the report seeks to strengthen the EU’s autonomy in respect of other global players, in particular, in respect of the United States, through having a strong foreign, security and defence policy, and this is something that I welcome. Yet the report again comes out in favour of strong cooperation between the EU and NATO and wants, for example, to create joint institutional structures. The call for a White Paper to be drawn up on the common security and defence policy (CSDP) which clearly defines the objectives of the policy is thus more than advisable. Much as I am critical of the increasing centralism of the European Union, I do support the creation of a permanent EU operations centre.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such a centre would enable us to both plan and execute diverse operations more efficiently. In addition, avoiding duplication of work would also lead to cost savings. The solidarity clause in connection with natural disasters that is referred to, like the establishment of a European civil protection force, is undoubtedly worthwhile and something that we should indeed strive for. Nevertheless, in the light of the unclear position in various areas, I was forced to abstain from the vote.</p>

In addition, maritime surveillance capability is to be established which, among other things, will limit ‘illegal’ immigration.

      <p sl="ro">I initiated Amendment 34 with the aim of modifying the text in paragraph 87 of this report, which referred to the development of the anti-missile shield in Europe in the wake of a bilateral agreement between the United States and Member States, including Romania. The amendment proposes removing the recommendation to develop this system ‘in dialogue with Russia’ replacing this phrase with a more balanced wording of ‘dialogue at continental level’. The new US project involving the development of the anti-missile defence system is strictly defensive in nature and guarantees the security of the whole of Eastern Europe and the Western Balkans. The project is not targeted against Russia. Consequently, I do not believe that there are any reasons for making Russia a participant and, possibly, a decision maker in the project’s development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These considerations have formed the basis for Amendment 34. I am pleased that this amendment was approved by 358 votes in favour.

Strengthening the Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) by having all the Member States sign and apply it comes within this framework. I opted to abstain from this particular motion for a resolution because it includes a basic point to which I am opposed and which the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left tried, unsuccessfully, to change. I refer to the phrase and import of the view that the EU can ‘use every means at its disposal to prevent, deter, halt and, where possible, eliminate proliferation programmes, which causes serious problems’. To be specific, the use or the threat of use of military means, especially as regards Iran, is extremely dangerous, will not have positive results for peace, and contradicts the perception of the left on military action by the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The increase in the number of members of the ‘nuclear club’, the terrorist threat and the relative ease with which weapons of mass destruction can be built today combine to deepen the climate of unrest in which we are now living.

The Union must be up to the challenges of nuclear non-proliferation, especially those posed by Iran and North Korea, which continue to be the biggest threats to international security. As for the reduction of nuclear arsenals, the priority is to continue to reduce the two main arsenals, that is, those of Russia and of the United States, which hold 95% of the world’s existing nuclear weapons.

In the current international climate, the danger of a new nuclear arms race is a matter of genuine concern.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The imposition of disarmament and of the end of the development, production and storage of new nuclear weapons are the basis of the spirit and letter of the NPT. The ongoing dispute over Iran’s nuclear programmes requires a peaceful solution, based on negotiations which it will be important to resume. Any military action or threat of the use of force will be counterproductive and will have consequences which are potentially dangerous for the region.

      <p sl="fr">The Iranian problem is at the heart of the debate in preparation for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference. To recap: Iran, in accepting the NPT, abandoned over time the option to equip itself with nuclear weapons. If the Republic of Iran were no longer to honour its commitments, we would have two problems. In the short term, this would constitute a threat to stability in a region in which most of the players are tempted to adopt radical positions. In the medium and long terms, Iran’s refusal to respect the provisions of the NPT would set a serious precedent as regards regional, and indeed global, security. It would clearly seem that the agitation of the members of the United Nations Security Council, who have the right of veto, plus Germany, is no longer enough to shake things up. A strong signal from the United States and Russia to show that they are both inclined unilaterally to reduce their nuclear arsenal could help give a sense of responsibility to the average nuclear powers that are also ready to disarm. Lastly, a strong gesture from the major powers could perhaps convince countries that are currently acquiring nuclear know-how to abandon their projects.</p>

To ensure effective multilateral efforts, they must be set within a well-developed vision of achieving a nuclear weapon-free world at the earliest date possible. We must insist on the commitment of the nuclear weapons states under Article VI of the NPT to disarm completely, as it was a key promise and so many countries have signed the NPT and thus forego nuclear weapons permanently. We oppose the phrase in this joint resolution (Recital G): ‘ … making use of all instruments at its disposal to prevent …’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I warn, in particular regarding Iran, that any military activity to prevent proliferation is completely counterproductive and highly dangerous. I am convinced that the best way to deal with the problem of proliferation would be to abandon atomic energy once and for all, as its civilian use bears great dangers on its own and, moreover, it cannot be excluded with sufficient certainty that civilian nuclear technology will not be used for military purposes.</p>

The fact that Iran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea do not intend to sign the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons constitutes a major risk. These countries also fail to fulfil international obligations in the area of nuclear safety.

We are in favour of the continued presence of such weapons as they contribute to burden-sharing and guaranteeing US military commitment to European security. In a number of places, there are implied criticisms of close allies whereas our criticisms should be aimed at those that are a threat to international security. Neither the UK nor France, nor indeed the US, now produce fissile material for weapons. It is a different matter to say that their production facilities for fissile materials should, at this stage, be abandoned. The call for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East is obviously aimed at Israel. Israel faces an existential threat from neighbours, several of whom have a history of developing nuclear and other WMDs, and indeed at least one, Iran, continues in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome very much the opportunity to discuss with you what I believe is an evolving Arctic policy in the European Union. It is a serious issue of growing political importance and I believe we have to treat it as such.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the aftermath of the Copenhagen negotiations, it is right that we pay increasing attention to that part of the world which has been witnessing the most tangible effects of climate change. Scientific evidence shows that the ice caps lost more than half of their thickness over the last decade.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other environmental changes are also having a growing impact on the Arctic’s people, biodiversity and landscape, both on land and at sea. Like other international actors, we have been increasingly active on Arctic issues. As you know, the Commission published its Arctic Communication in late 2008, which was welcomed by the Council, and that was followed in December 2009 by extensive conclusions on Arctic issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe this represents another step in the process to gradually building up a coherent, comprehensive Arctic policy. As you know, the Commission has been asked to prepare a follow-up report in June 2011, and that will be another opportunity to further develop our thinking together. All this work is in progress, and that is why I am very eager today to hear the views of Members of this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the Commission appreciated your resolution on Arctic governance of October 2008, which provided good impetus in the last stages of the Commission’s drafting of the communication. We seek support from Parliament for our efforts to ensure the European Union is recognised as a responsible and respected player in the Arctic. Our geographical position and our ongoing programmes in the Arctic are our starting point, but we want to develop this further.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are three main areas for the work which I would like to mention very briefly. First we want to contribute to the protection of the Arctic region, including its population. The Arctic’s ecosystem is very fragile and therefore needs maximum protection and safeguards. At the same time, because of climate change, the resources of the Arctic are becoming increasingly accessible. That offers opportunities, but must be handled with great care.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want to ensure our citizens and companies are treated fairly, including in the areas of transport and natural resources, and that needs to be done in a very deliberate and careful manner with appropriate environmental safeguards. Both objectives can and should be developed jointly by EU institutions and Member States, especially the three Arctic Member States. All should continue to work closely together with other Arctic stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our third objective is to contribute to robust and enhanced governance arrangements to handle the multiple challenges that affect the Arctic region. That includes the implementation of existing agreements, frameworks and arrangements, including the Arctic Council, and full respect for the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas. But, where relevant, we should take a careful look at whether and how these arrangements could be complemented and developed further.</p>
      <p sl="en">To be credible, we should recognise that the Arctic region is radically different from the Antarctic and this recognition should guide our policy response. Unlike the Antarctic, which is a vast and inhabited continent surrounded by an ocean, the Arctic is a maritime space surrounded by land which has been inhabited by people for thousands of years and which belongs to sovereign countries. Therefore, proposals to replicate the Antarctic Treaty in the Arctic region would be unrealistic, and they would probably also be detrimental to the proactive role that we aim to develop.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, this is also the view of the Council. We very much want to maintain close cooperation with the European Parliament as we pursue our common goals of gradually building up an EU Arctic policy and we must work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Madam Vice-President, many thanks for having opened the debate here on this subject, which I think is an important one. Those who are participating in this debate here today will share this view, and I think that we will also be able to achieve a very large consensus in the debate. I am the rapporteur for a report that is still to be drawn up on this subject, and I would very much like to work closely with all those involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">You mentioned a number of key words. Protecting the environment is very important. You mentioned the resident populations, the resources below sea level, and also fisheries. Another key word is shipping, the shipping routes that climate change is opening up: the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the vicinity of these passages, alongside our three Arctic Member States, are, of course, at least two global players – the United States and Russia – as well as a major partner in the shape of Canada. These States are the immediate adjacent territories with whom we must, at all events, build up and improve our contact in the context of this policy, which we are now aiming to develop.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where raw materials are concerned, specifically, we have the potential for cooperation – but there is also the potential for conflict if we do not approach this in the right way. The EU will certainly not be planting its flag on the seabed, as the Russians have done. We should, however, seek dialogue with these affected parties in order, in this way, to be able to achieve, in a consensual manner, those things that are important for the region in terms of environmental protection, the extraction of resources and the rights of local residents.</p>

      <p sl="fi">The Arctic treasure chest that is opening up is full of economic opportunities, but it poses many environmental and security risks, as well as those connected with the fate of the indigenous peoples. Global warming is opening up new sea routes and enabling the exploitation of oil and gas resources in an environmentally destructive way. The Swedish International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), among others, has already published a paper, ominously entitled ‘Ice-free Arctic’, on China’s Arctic policy. That is why the European Union must take urgent action and draw up its own Arctic policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission’s conclusions you presented to us are welcome, inasmuch as the region, with its oil, gas and minerals, is not just seen as a new Eldorado: the main focus is on the people who live there, and this is a very important aspect of the situation. The EU also has to be willing to hold constructive talks with the indigenous peoples, and that is one way the Union can come to play a decisive role in Arctic policy. For example, Parliament’s recent restrictions on seal hunting infuriated the indigenous population.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is very important to strengthen the status of the Arctic Council, and for that reason, we must now have a greater influence on Canada and Russia in particular, so that the European Union can have a stronger role to play. Arctic research is an important area of cooperation; for example, the University of Lapland, where you are going, is where the University of the Arctic is based, and I am sure that when the Arctic Information Centre is established, as the Commission has indicated, Rovaniemi would be a suitable location.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In addition, the European Union’s own structures need to be strengthened. Unfortunately, it does seem to be the case that in the Council, the Arctic Ocean has been trampled underfoot by the Southern and Eastern Dimension, and so this Northern Dimension’s Arctic window should now be opened. Baroness Ashton, the Commission needs to clarify the role of each Directorate-General and indicate the person responsible for Arctic issues.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to say to the High Representative: thank you so much for your statement. I think many of us in this Chamber are so pleased that you are carrying on what was started by the Commission and also followed up by the Presidency statements last autumn.</p>
      <p sl="de">You underlined the fragile nature and environment of the Arctic. That fragile nature is, as you recognised, a global concern, not just one that concerns Europe or indeed those nations in the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Arctic also presents itself as a unique opportunity for multinational cooperation. It is unique also for us as the EU to have a positive relationship with Russia there, through the Northern Dimension. That is something we must absolutely build on with other partners.</p>
      <p sl="de">But it has to be a meaningful cooperation overall in the Arctic, and it is worrying – and you did not touch on this in your statement – that we see the development of an inner core of five coastal states of the Arctic meeting outside the architecture of the Arctic Council. This could seriously undermine a very precious cooperation and it has to be treated with some seriousness.</p>
      <p sl="de">Likewise, we – the EU – have been rebuffed for observer status. We have some fences we need to mend and we need to try to re-establish confidence in what it is that we want to establish in the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the original Commission communication was an amazing document in the way it brought together many cross-cutting issues across a number of DGs in the Commission. This is a good basis on which we can build. We all wait with interest as to how you will coordinate this policy, going forward in the new Commission and with your unique role wearing two hats. But thank you for the start.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, a sort of cultural schizophrenia is apparent in our attitude to the Arctic region. On the one hand, we are concerned. It is quite obvious that climate change is taking place faster in the Arctic than elsewhere. The region has been compared to a canary in a mine.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Since 1979, the average annual ice cover in the Arctic Ocean has shrunk by around 1.5 million square kilometres, which is the area of France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom combined. This melting process is accelerating climate change because it is reducing the earth’s reflectance, or albedo. It is releasing methane from the tundra, and could also release it from the seabed. Methane speeds up climate change even more. The melting process also allows toxins that have accumulated over many years to be released into the environment.</p>
      <p sl="fi">While we are concerned about the situation, at the same time, an oil and gas rush has started in the Arctic. Countries are quarrelling and negotiating about how the seabed might be divided up. Moreover, the indigenous peoples are largely being ignored in all this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU should now be promoting a consistent approach to sustainable development. It should control the glittery images of euro and dollar signs and support the protection of the Arctic region by means of the same sort of agreement that applies to the Antarctic. Furthermore, the indigenous peoples should be included in all decision-making processes that relate to the region. In any event, there should be a 50-year moratorium on the exploitation of fossil resources in the area.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It needs to be understood that nature and wildlife in the region are delicate and vulnerable. For example, there are much greater problems and worse risks associated with drilling for oil there than elsewhere. Shipping companies also need to acknowledge the enormous difficulties and risks that exist in the region. It is of no help whatsoever if we merely tag a few nice words about the environment and the indigenous peoples on to the decisions we take but our actual deeds mean that we seriously risk contaminating the environment irreversibly and that we violate the rights of the indigenous population.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when Denmark joined the EU in 1973, the EU assumed an Arctic dimension through the Danish dependency of Greenland. In 1985, Greenland chose to leave the EU but, when Sweden and Finland joined 10 years later, they substantially enlarged the EU’s interest in the Arctic region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since then, the EU has become one of the many actors with a vital strategic interest in the Arctic – its environment and its natural resources. As countries with territory in the Arctic, the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway and Iceland all defend their interests robustly and vigorously. The European Union should not hesitate now to do so as well and the Arctic Council, in my view, is the best arena in which to do so. The Union’s ad hoc observer status in the Arctic Council is inadequate for this purpose. I hope that the High Representative will insist on permanent observer status for the EU at the next ministerial meeting in April next year in Greenland.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is regrettable that Canada is blocking the EU in retaliation for the Union’s ban on seal products, and I hope that, eventually, common sense will prevail. This approach makes little sense, given the fact that six EU Member States, including the United Kingdom – my own – are permanent observers. Nevertheless, the coordination between Denmark, Sweden and Finland on the Arctic Council has been exemplary and has served as a platform for the EU’s wider interest to be heard in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The contributions of our ally, Norway, and Iceland, now an aspiring EU Member State, have further galvanised European participation in the Arctic Forum. This is vital because Russia has left us in little doubt as to its own designs on the Arctic, famously planting a Russian flag on the seabed of the North Pole in 2007. We know to our cost that Russia sometimes follows its own rule book in international affairs. Only a united front by other members and the observers on the Arctic Council, working through the EU’s Northern Dimension policy, will keep the Kremlin in check. We cannot allow the Arctic to become the new arena for Russia’s expansionist tendencies.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, there are many good reasons for discussing the Arctic. A number of them have been mentioned. There is the question of climate change, in that the Arctic region has been hard hit by global warming. There is the question of natural resources, in that the Arctic region offers enormous riches. Then there is the question of the opening of the northern maritime route, which entails totally new transport patterns. However, the crucial question for my group is from what angle we should approach the Arctic. Should our starting point be all the advantages, in a narrow sense, which the EU can get from the Arctic region? Or should our starting point be how the development of the Arctic region can benefit the global community – while at the same time, let us not forget, fully respecting the right to self-determination of the Arctic people?</p>
      <p sl="da">A key test of this question lies in the position we take: should we work towards the Arctic becoming an area where a new arms race can be allowed to flourish – Russia has played an active part here and others have followed – or should the Arctic, like the Antarctic, be a demilitarised area? Obviously, there is a difference between the North Pole and the South Pole, the Arctic and the Antarctic. However, it is interesting that we have succeeded in forging a treaty on the Antarctic, in which we have ruled out military presence and stipulated that this region may only be used for peaceful purposes. The major issue facing the Commission is whether it should work towards making the Arctic a demilitarised area, and should that be the case, which specific initiatives it should take in that direction.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the Arctic issue is important and it has now also come before us here. We in Finland are familiar with conditions in the Arctic. We live there. When Baroness Ashton goes to Lapland, she will find a lot of people who live and work north of the Arctic Circle. When I myself go there on Sunday, I will find a lot of people there who are particularly worried about work and their livelihood, because in a real democracy, people can choose freely where they want to live. They can also live in the Arctic if they wish.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The University of Lapland in Rovaniemi is the best place to carry out this study from the viewpoint of finances and research. Diana Wallis had given a positive appraisal of this in the Finnish newspaper ‘Kaleva’, and for once I would be quite happy to express my agreement with a liberal view, so I will.</p>
      <p sl="fi">From the viewpoint of the future, we should take three issues into account: nature, animals and people.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate today and want to address a very specific issue that has already been raised by some of the colleagues that I have listened to.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that living conditions in the beautiful Arctic area are harsh, but there is equally no doubt that, with new technologies and advances, the area will inevitably be opened up for greater exploitation of its natural resources, with fisheries being a prime example.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the Commission communication of 2008, the current extent of fisheries is examined, as is the possibility that new areas could be opened up. It is indeed right that there should be some systematic approach to this. Fishing in a sustainable manner protects stocks and gives a future to fishing communities. The same document also, quite rightly, makes mention of the need to protect indigenous peoples and local populations, using the statistic that about one third of the four million people who live in the area are indigenous to the area – again, a very laudable objective. However – and this is where I warn the Commission – I still see the evidence, in both of the documents, that the Commission has not learnt the lesson from the disaster of the common fisheries policy which, in Northern Ireland, has been responsible for the destruction of the fishing industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">The top-down approach of always controlling and setting policy targets and methods from Brussels has been an abject failure, yet the inference from the 2008 document and from the Foreign Affairs Council of December 2009 is that the EU will use the same approach in the Arctic region. I urge the High Representative, as she continues to explore how to coordinate policy in this area, to be mindful of this particular issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, with the development of the modern world, policy on Arctic issues, which has been associated with extreme climate conditions, polar bears and boundless ice fields, is beginning to take on new significance. Development of international trade and increased need for natural resources has caused a growth in interest in the region. As a result of rapid shrinking of the Arctic ice cap, new possibilities for exploitation of the region have arisen. The Arctic is being transformed from an outpost to the centre of interest of countries seeking new shipping routes, endless sources of natural wealth and stocks of fish. However, we already know all this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question is – how should the Union react to the nervous preparations for a kind of invasion of the Arctic which have been under way for some time in Russia, the USA, Canada and Norway? Above all, it is necessary to deal with the unregulated legal status of the Arctic region. Policy based on the diplomatic means which have been used until now should produce an international understanding guaranteeing a fair division of potential territorial acquisitions. The lack of legal regulations may make the region a source of conflict which is global in nature. What is needed, then, is systematic and coordinated action which will respond to the challenges which are appearing at rapid speed. Research infrastructure, development of multipartite management of the Arctic based on the UN convention and involvement of the local Arctic population are only some of the elements which must be contained in future European Arctic strategy, whose aim will be to maintain a balance between protection of the natural environment and sustainable use of its resources.</p>

      <p sl="el">May I extend a welcome to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Arctic is the place on the planet where climate change is most obvious. Global warming has caused the ice to recede significantly. The landmark year was 2007, when the ice receded by 34% compared with the period from 1970-2000.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, the melting of the Arctic ice cap has numerous, drastic consequences. It speeds up climate change. To date, the white surface of the Arctic ice reflected 80% of sunlight falling in the area, thereby affecting global and local temperatures. This reflection is reducing constantly, causing a rise in the temperature of the planet and of the polar area as a whole across a 1500-metre zone within Canada, Russia and Alaska. In 2007, the temperature rose by 2° between August and October.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, the melting of the ice has caused unforeseen changes in sea currents. It is having an adverse effect on marine ecosystems and fisheries and reducing the ability of the sea to absorb carbon dioxide, as it affects plankton and other organisms and raises sea levels.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why European citizens are saddened by frequent talk of the European Union’s participation in escalating competition to reap geopolitical benefits from this environmental catastrophe in the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="el">The role of the European Union should not be to win an international geopolitical competition for oil and shipping lanes in the Arctic. Our role should be to safeguard respect for our principles, respect for the environmental integrity of the area, the prevalence of principles such as international competition and respect for UN institutions under whatever new regime arises in the Arctic from the huge environmental catastrophe under way.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I welcome this debate and I am pleased that Baroness Ashton is here and taking part in the debate. You spoke of how this is about protecting the region and the resident population. That is certainly true. When it comes to the indigenous peoples of this region, though, in particular, it is about more than protection that we grant from outside; it is about respect for their right to self-determination. This has to be a very important principle in Arctic policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">As concerns the protection of nature in this region, it should be pointed out that there are, of course, an especially high number of sensitive areas. I am aware that many of you participating in this debate reject the idea of a moratorium. Perhaps, Baroness Ashton, that was at the back of your mind when you said that ‘the Arctic region is radically different from the Antarctic’, but even when rejecting a moratorium, the question must be answered – and in practical, not just lyrical, terms – of how the areas of particular sensitivity in this region can be effectively protected under the precautionary principle. We cannot allow the situation to develop to the point where, in the interests of short-sighted economics, the battle cry of ‘we need the gas, we need the fish’ ultimately overrides all precautionary principles.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to tie in to what Mr Gahler had to say. Mr Gahler, you spoke about the potential for conflict. This is undoubtedly true. We can also already see that, internationally, these discussions are not characterised solely by a will to find common ground, or else Canada and Russia, for example, would not have attempted to block the EU’s observer status in the Arctic Council. The Arctic Council, of course, is itself a soft-law organisation with no fixed budget or staff. It will not do as a governance structure. However, we must take care, when considering new governance structures – and I understood this to be your position, High Representative – to move forwards in an inclusive manner, and to acknowledge that other organisations, too, want to be involved here.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I see that both the Commission and the High Representative have taken the view that the EU should lay down a policy for the Arctic. I sympathise, of course, with the idea of protecting the environment in the Arctic and, as a Dane, I am extremely aware of the geopolitical situation. I am also well aware of the problems faced by the local population and we should, of course, respect their way of life. Having said that, I do not think that the EU should have a policy for the area, nor do I think that the EU should take on an administrative role in the Arctic region. That would not be to the benefit of the Union or the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="da">In my view, we should leave the Arctic to those countries which are directly involved in the region. It neither can nor should it be the EU’s job to set up a policy for all areas, let alone for the Arctic, which is an area where we have traditionally cooperated very well and where only two (and not three, as was said here) of the countries involved are members of the EU. Neither the US, Canada, Greenland nor Russia have expressed a wish to become a member of the EU. You might perhaps suspect that the sudden interest in this area has been triggered solely by the different countries wanting to get their hands on raw materials, rather than anything else. In other words: the best policy with regard to the Arctic would be for the EU to get involved on the sidelines only.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is an English folk tale about King Canute who, by ordering the tide not to come in and wet his feet, showed his courtiers that not even kings are exempt from reality. In doing so, he became a byword for arrogant folly.</p>
      <p sl="en">King Canute lives on in the Council of the European Union, which begins and ends its conclusion on Arctic affairs with the alleged importance of global warming. This involves a refusal to accept scientific reality. According to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, Arctic summer ice has increased by 409 000 square miles, or 26%, since 2007. This is exactly what was predicted by scientists aware that the previous shrinkage of summer ice, wrongly used as evidence for global warming, was in fact nothing more than a snapshot of an ages-old natural cyclical pulse of advance, retreat and advance.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the Arctic summer ice will not vanish by 2013 and polar bears have not, and will not, drown because of global warming. But millions of hard-working voters are drowning in a sea of debt and taxes, and they are growing very impatient with the political class’s use of the global warming fraud to impose undemocratic international governance and bogus green taxes.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the Arctic is a unique region which is coming under discussion increasingly often as a result of the melting of the ice cap and the new opportunities that this brings with it. This is a good thing, because we need to have more debates, not just about the impact that the ice melting will have on our opportunities to make use of the resources that have suddenly become accessible, but also about the responsibilities that this involves and how we can best preserve the Arctic and assess the future consequences of our presence and our activities in this sensitive natural environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, before we decide on the common EU policy regarding the Arctic, we should spend more time evaluating the current situation in the Arctic ecosystem, because otherwise it will be difficult for us to take adequate measures. In my opinion, it is both naïve and unrealistic to think that we can simply leave all the resources untouched. Instead, we should focus on ensuring that the extraction of resources, transport, tourism and other industries are all run in the best possible way in order to protect and preserve the natural environment. Of course, this must take place in consultation and collaboration with the local population on the basis of the actual situation and the current conditions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Commission’s report on the Arctic is a positive first step towards a coherent policy on the Arctic. During the Swedish Presidency, Sweden supported the Commission’s decision to apply for permanent observer status on the Arctic Council. However, I believe that both the Commission’s report and the debate until now have focused too closely on the water and not enough on the areas of land. Some countries, such as Sweden and Finland, have extensive reindeer herding, mining, farming and forestry activities in the Arctic and it is very important that these are taken into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Another dimension of the debate which is not often mentioned, but which needs to be highlighted, concerns the EU’s strategic objectives and geostrategic interests in the Arctic and the consequences of the change in the conditions in this region for international stability.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Some EU Member States lie within the Arctic region. Other parts of the region are the EU’s immediate neighbours to the north. Therefore, it should not be difficult to draw up common strategic objectives and to gain support for them among all the EU Member States. Given the increased competition between different countries and some unresolved conflicts, it must be in the EU’s interest to ensure that tensions do not arise over security in the Arctic.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Today, we are debating a very important matter. The effect of climate change is fundamentally changing the situation in the Arctic region. Due to the impact of global warming, new maritime routes have opened up in the Arctic, offering opportunities to transport oil, gas and other natural resources, but at the same time, this region is becoming very vulnerable because of environmental problems and the division of its resources between states and this may have negative consequences for international stability and the interests of European security. As we discuss the impact of the environment and climate change on this region, one of the main goals of Arctic policy must be to mitigate the negative impact of climate change and help the region to adapt to unavoidable change. Until now, no arrangement has been applied to the Arctic region. The European Parliament has underlined the importance of the governance of the Arctic on more than one occasion. I think that now that the situation has changed, we must gradually begin to form an autonomous European Union policy and the European Commission should, in turn, play an active role in this matter. For a long time, the situation in this region has caused tension between the countries of the Arctic territory and this tension will increase even more as this region becomes increasingly more accessible. I believe that the European Union must initiate a comprehensive dialogue with the other countries and this would open the door to new opportunities for cooperation.

This could, however, give rise to a potential security threat to relations between the European Union and other countries. For this reason, I would like to draw your attention to the behaviour of Russia, which is not about fishing, tourism or mineral ores, but about the world’s last untouched gas and oil supplies.</p>
      <p sl="et">Despite the idea arising from the European Commission’s Arctic Strategy to engage in cooperation with neighbouring countries in matters concerning adjacent territories, since the turn of the millennium, Russia has not shown any willingness to consider our wishes.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, let us get back to the point. As many of our fellow Members have said, the race is on for the natural resources and administration of the Arctic region.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Arctic region, however, needs a comprehensive approach, as the High Representative said here. It will have to take account of the extremely fragile nature of Arctic wildlife, the long-term effect of melting ice, and, more than anything, the rights of the region’s indigenous peoples and of the other people who live there.</p>
      <p sl="fi">So far, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its Fish Stocks Agreement have been enough to regulate the extraction of natural resources in the Arctic sea area and on the seabed. The Arctic Council has concentrated on environmental and research cooperation, but the agreements that focus on the use of natural resources have brought with them a growing need to develop international administration strategies, and the EU, too, may have a role to play here. Furthermore, the EU’s Arctic policy needs its own strategy, and it should be jointly coordinated.</p>
      <p sl="fi">An appropriate way for the EU to be involved in the Arctic would be to establish an Arctic Centre. The first time this need for an EU Arctic Information Centre was mentioned was in the Commission’s Communication on the European Union and the Arctic Region in autumn 2008. At the Council’s behest, the Commission began to explore the possibility of establishing such a centre in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Arctic Centre at the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi, on the Arctic Circle, has indicated its willingness to function as the EU Arctic Information Centre. Finland does not have any territorial claims with respect to natural resources, so the country, as a neutral actor, would be a suitable choice for running the Centre, as Mrs Wallis has also encouragingly stated.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would therefore urge High Representative Ashton to make a decision on the form an EU Arctic Centre should take, its location and its tasks, thus raising the EU’s profile in Arctic policy. I wish you a pleasant trip to Lapland.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in the context of the climate change debate, there is now a more intense debate about the Arctic as a waterway for shipping with the opportunity of perhaps shortening trade routes and thus consuming less fuel – do not forget that that, too, is one side of the picture – which includes the question of whether and in what form resources ranging from oil to gas are present and how they can be exploited. Fishing, too, has been mentioned. Of course, there has been, and continues to be, a very symbolic value to this debate, which was made clear when Russia laid – hoisted is not quite the right word here – its flag on the seabed. The other States, too, are starting to articulate their claims more strongly. With that in mind, I am very grateful to the High Representative for the fact that she is tackling and prioritising this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, what has so far been discussed in the European Parliament, and also in the Commission, such as in its 2008 proposal, which has also been referred to, is far too defensive. I believe that this question must be approached offensively, and in both respects. That means both in respect of the issue that many Members have raised here, namely the protection of the environment and of local residents, and in respect of the fact that we need to cautiously face the issue of whether this perhaps also comes with opportunities and to have an honest discussion about that. In the context of an oil report in 2008, we did have initial and very cautious discussions about this issue and set a first course. When we are always talking about how we need diversification and new sources, including for resources and energy supplies, we do have to discuss whether there is a possibility of exploiting these sources without jeopardising nature and the environment. This debate must at least be held – we must use this opportunity. We are in a different technological position today and, incidentally, the technological achievements in this field today are European achievements. If we are talking about further development of the technology, then this must be in all areas. I am grateful that this debate is being held. I hope it will be held in an objective and open way.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, who will take control of the Arctic? That is the title of a press article I found when researching the subject. It succinctly, but one might also say pointedly, describes the current situation of the race for the Arctic. In this matter, the question posed by Mrs Ashton would appear to be very appropriate – how can the European Union be a responsible player in the area of problems connected with the Arctic? Responsible – I stress this. This is why this debate in the European Parliament seems to me to be in every respect useful and good, because it is taking place, here, for the second time, as a result of the first and the present communication from the Council to Parliament, and from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Arctic is a region which is not governed on the basis of international law, and the huge interest in the Arctic is, on the one hand, as has already been emphasised, a result of climate change, but, on the other, it is also increasingly clearly being recognised and readily used as a potential resource, especially of energy resources and gas, but also of natural resources such as, for example, fish. There are, of course, dangers associated with this – dangers for the environment in connection with the use of raw materials and fishing, but also for the indigenous people of the region, and that is something of which we must also be particularly aware.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, the opening of a route, the sea lane, in connection with changes in the region, is having a huge influence on the way people are looking at the Arctic. A similar influence is being had by the attempts at actually dividing the territory based on a series of faits accomplis , such as a symbolic placing of flags. I would like to say it should be noted that the five Arctic countries are not specially interested in legal regulations, but the Union should, however, be playing an important role in this part of the world, not only by its presence, but principally by its involvement and knowledge. It is essential to build mutual trust, and we can build that mutual trust by an initiative in the area of regulation, such as, for example, the Arctic Charter.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to take the floor in my capacity as rapporteur of this Parliament for Iceland.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At present, as you are all aware, Iceland is waiting for the Council to confirm that accession negotiations can get under way. If, as we all wish to see, Iceland becomes a Member State of the European Union, it will be the only Member State located exclusively in the Arctic region. Iceland would, together with Finland, Denmark and Sweden, increase the number of European Union states on the Arctic Council to four, along with the United States, Russia, Canada and Norway.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that this fact is all the more important, given that the European Union has not been given, unfortunately, observer status in this forum.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, I believe that Iceland’s accession to the EU may contribute, first of all, to the diversification of Europe’s energy resources and secondly, to setting up multilateral governance in this region which is attracting ever-growing interest and may give rise, as has also been mentioned in previous speeches, to conflicts. Last but not least, Iceland’s accession may result in a coherent and effective European policy in this region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In conclusion, I believe that when Iceland joins the European Union, the EU will have a more important role in this strategic region.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is high time to create a coherent European and Arctic policy that will also resolve lengthy disputes over new territories. As a result of melting, the extraction potential in the new territories will increase to 200 m below the surface, involving millions of square kilometres. Disputes between Russia, Norway, the US and Canada obviously have a geopolitical significance as well. The ice cover has already shrunk by half. The most important thing, however, is to protect the water from pollution, while the nuclear waste in the Russian Arctic is also a key issue.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Madam High Representative, I come from a country which seemingly has nothing to do with the Arctic, but I can assure you that even in the Czech Republic, many citizens are interested in what position the Union will adopt as far as foreign policy is concerned, including influencing the future of the Arctic. This involves the sustainable extraction of raw materials, sustainable transport, conditions for scientific research, the protection of nature and, last but not least, the rights of the indigenous inhabitants.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I follow with displeasure the disputes over both new and historical possessions. I fear that this may even be a new source of serious conflicts. Another one is the dispute over the strategic north passage between Asia and America. Commissioner, you must ensure that the passage falls permanently within international waters, and that the Arctic remains a permanently demilitarised zone. Take an active coordinating role in reaching international agreements on all of these issues relating to the Arctic. The Union should not look on passively, but should negotiate actively and thereby prevent the escalation of conflicts and of the harm to nature.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, it is important that the EU is involved in the debate on the Arctic and it is also good that the EU is engaging with the region, where many interests and concerns are at stake. In my opinion, the most important thing is that the EU’s actions are considerate and respectful of the wishes and needs of the indigenous population. The EU should take responsibility when it comes to global warming, which manifests itself very much in the form of temperature increases. In this context, we need to take into account what this means for the people’s living conditions. In addition, we know that climate change will facilitate our access to resources, such as oil and gas, and to new transport routes from Europe to Asia. On the one hand, that could be positive but, on the other, we should ensure that we take safety measures which will fully take into account the unique climate and the fragile environment of the Arctic.</p>
      <p sl="da">With the growing economic interests in the Arctic, it is also important that the EU takes a position on various countries’ actions in the area. It should not go unnoticed when countries do not play by the international rules which apply to this region. One telling example currently in evidence is Canada, which is seeking to set up a compulsory register for all large vessels passing through the Northwest Passage from July 2010. I would stress that we are talking about international waters here and that Lene Espersen, the Danish Foreign Minister, has also emphatically said that this is unacceptable. Now, that is a position that I would like to see the EU and the High Representative endorse.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, it is a question of us, as the European Union, following a clear strategy and preventing a gold or gemstone rush. Europe must actively involve itself here. Europe, as a partner, can show strength here by speaking with one voice. This relates to shipping on and below the water, fisheries, resources in the form of primary energy carriers and raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this connection, we need stable and dependable treaties with the other partners in the Arctic. We need cooperation, not confrontation. We need dialogue in the field of environmental protection in order to conserve natural resources and nature. We need dialogue in the field of animal protection in order to conserve the biodiversity, and we need protection and respect for the local inhabitants and their human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we can implement positive resource management together with our partners in the Arctic, we will have the opportunity to take new political roads here, and it will also be a first acid test for our common foreign policy – a chance to prove that we, as Europeans, can indeed pursue objectives together.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, firstly, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to the High Representative for including this important issue in the agenda at such an early stage. I truly hope that the Commission and the whole of the European Union will have a strong role to play in Arctic policy and that the EU will formulate its own Arctic strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A common Arctic policy will create boundless opportunities for the whole of the European Union, in terms of its security, environment, energy, transport, and its indigenous peoples. If we, the European Union are excluded from the debate – excluded from this policy - we will be losing a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I wish to make two more points. Firstly, I hope that the Arctic Council, as an administrative body, will continue to grow in strength and that the European Union will have a strong role to play in it. Secondly, I hope that the plans for an Arctic Information Centre become a reality: this, I believe, will promote dialogue between the Arctic territories. Furthermore, and as has been said before, an excellent and suitable location for it would definitely be Finnish Lapland, and specifically Rovaniemi, which has long been associated with Arctic issues.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Arctic is not only a concern with regard to the climate, it also involves something of a potential for conflict. The fact that even China has supposedly now begun building icebreakers highlights the importance of a trade route via the Northwest Passage as the ice sheet melts. This potential peaceful use, however, is far less problematic than, for example, the intensified desire of the United States to station military early warning systems in the Arctic region.</p>
      <p sl="de">The conditions for any conceivable economic exploitation of the mineral resources linked to the melting of the ice should also be clarified in advance. Ultimately, the suspected oil and gas reserves to be found there could guarantee Europe’s energy independence.</p>

Given that ships sailing traditional shipping routes are being seized, since the lives of captains and crews are being jeopardised by this, as these routes are really unsafe, shipowners are looking for new routes.

      <p sl="ro">The European Union must show restraint with regard to both the use of offshore resources and transit transport through the Arctic region.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think it has been a very interesting debate and I am so glad that we have had the focus on an important region of the world. The passion with which people have spoken about the importance of what we do in terms of policy for the Arctic is extremely important for me as I take forward what I believe we should be doing in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to assure Members of the House that preserving the environment and dialogue with the relevant populations – indigenous and non-indigenous – are paramount to the approach that we want to take. We want to make clear in all international discussions that Arctic resources should only be accessed and exploited when we have the highest environmental and safety standards and when they are fully respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to continue to underline that the European Union wants to work together with all the stakeholders concerned in the Arctic to make sure that we face the challenges appropriately. That includes hydrocarbon extraction in that context.</p>
      <p sl="en">For my part, I think we have much to contribute, from our diplomacy on environment to our climate change policies; from our extensive Arctic research programmes to our policy supporting indigenous policies worldwide. I believe, too, that the Arctic Council has much to contribute. It is because of the work it does, not least in making sure that there is a full participation of indigenous people – in fact, it is the only organisation that allows them to sit alongside sovereign states – that we want to become permanent observers, which a number of honourable Members have indicated would be very useful.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is possible to find a proper balance between Arctic protection and preservation, on the one hand, and the sustainable use of its resources on the other, and we must ensure that we do that properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The bringing together of seven representatives from different parts of the Commission – I think you told me yesterday, Madam President – to produce the report is a good example of the future that we wish to have in terms of collaboration and effective working manifested through the work that we do on the ground across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I very much look forward to going to Lapland this weekend. It will be my third trip there. There is a big meeting to discuss issues with some of the foreign ministers.

We must be aware that the planet’s future is closely linked to this region’s future. The melting of the icebergs in the Arctic region, the growing need for resources and recent technological progress are some of the reasons why the Arctic region has become an area of particular interest to each of us. I think that the European strategy for this zone must focus on protecting and conserving the region, promoting sustainable use of the resources in the context of multilateral governance and, above all, on involving the population of this region in all these measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The appearance of new navigable channels also requires much tighter security and environmental standards to be established.

      <p sl="pl">A spectre is hovering over the Arctic. The spectre of global warming. The melting ice is having a crucial influence, not only on nature, but also on social relations, the economy and politics. On that oceanic ice shelf, on an area greater than Germany, Italy and France put together, apart from what is already being used, there are riches such as gas and crude oil. The layers of ice, which are getting thinner year by year, have stopped protecting the deposits from explorative drilling. A ruthless race is in prospect – a madness on the scale of the 19th-century gold rush. The European Union must adopt an unequivocal position on this. It is essential to develop a common, EU Arctic policy, especially concerning the use of new possibilities for the exploitation of natural deposits, dangers to the natural environment and new shipping opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Arctic forms part of the territory of three EU Member States: Denmark, Finland and Sweden, as well as Iceland, which is applying for membership. We must remember that this is a completely new situation for the people of the far north, and also for the fauna and flora. The residents of the Arctic are aware of the growing influence of external social, economic and political factors on their lives. Our role is to help local communities find their feet in the new conditions and to protect their culture and language. Just as at the centre of EU policy are its citizens, so in plans to manage the Arctic, the key position must be occupied by the Arctic’s people.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Arctic has long been absent from our agenda, but now it is once again drawing the attention of politicians and academics. The growing concern over the region is a consequence of climate change causing the melting of the Arctic ice cap. Not getting involved in the dispute over the speed and extent of this process, it is widely assumed that it will eventually open up new possibilities for natural resources exploration and new maritime routes. We all agree that environmental consequences of this process will be profound. What I would like to draw the attention of this House and the EU as a whole to though is its political and, indeed, security dimension. The Cold War showed us how strategically important the Arctic is. We have witnessed economic, political, even military rivalry in this region. For its positive future, there is a clear need for a joint international effort, in which the EU should play an active role. There is a need to find a balance between economic exploitation of the region and its ecosystem, but there is also a need to protect, inter alia, the existing legal regime governing the Arctic, to name just this one issue.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the death of Orlando Zapata was an extremely negative event, which should never have happened, and we do not want it to happen again in Cuba or anywhere else.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union and its institutions must be committed to condemning events that constitute violations of human rights, and working to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. This must be the European Union’s commitment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Human rights are a fundamental symbol of the European Union’s identity, because we believe in the values of freedom, tolerance and pluralism. It is therefore our personality, our most genuine personality. Where there are violations of these universal rights, the European Union condemns them publicly, and we have done this with Cuba. We did so when we indicated our pessimism and concern regarding the lack of progress on human rights in Cuba, and we did so when we demanded that the prisoners of conscience in Cuban prisons be released. There are currently around 200 prisoners of conscience, some of them in a very complex situation with regard to their health, and one of them is Guillermo Fariñas, who is in a very grave situation and also on hunger strike.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also did so when we said that human rights defenders in Cuba needed to be protected, and we did so when we said that the Cuban Government, which had a number of prisoners under its jurisdiction, should be called to account for the death of Orlando Zapata.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the European Union’s policy with regard to Cuba goes further. The European Union’s policy with regard to Cuba is structured around certain elements, and I would like to highlight some of them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, there is political dialogue. Political dialogue with the Cuban institutions, with the authorities and with the whole of civil society, which naturally also extends to human rights. Secondly, there is development cooperation with Cuba, which is solidarity with the Cuban people, nothing more and nothing less. It also involves promoting progress in terms of culture and democratic practices in Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are the fundamental elements of a policy that is essentially aimed at a single target: the Cuban people, their welfare, their progress, their living conditions and respect for their human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission deeply regrets the death of Mr Orlando Zapata and its circumstances. I would also like to express my deep concern for the other political prisoners in Cuba. All of us in this room share the same sense of anger and frustration at the death of Mr Zapata, and we should do our very best to make sure that such events do not happen again in Cuba, or in any other country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is rooted in the values of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which we strive to protect and promote after having suffered, until very recently, violations of basic human rights on our own continent. Human rights are universal and have no borders. This principle is an integral part of our dialogue with all partners in Europe and outside.</p>
      <p sl="en">Constructive engagement, not a policy of coercion and sanctions, remains the basis of our policy towards Cuba, as underlined in the common position adopted in 1996. This is the rationale that led the Council to decide in June 2008 to lift the 2003 diplomatic measures, as a means to facilitate the political dialogue process and enable full use of the instruments under the 1996 common position. This is also the rationale that has led numerous Member States to resume their development cooperation with Cuba over the past few months, representing a diverse range of the political parties represented in the European Parliament and reflecting, therefore, the shared view of the important role to be played by development cooperation in Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="en">At such times in Cuba, inaction would be the worst possible option for the credibility of the European Union as a global actor. What is at stake is not only that credibility, but also our capacity to be present in Cuba. Thus, I firmly believe that the way forward is to pursue and deepen the ongoing political dialogue and continue cooperation with Cuba as a tool for improving the lives of the Cuban people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cooperation with Cuba has never been suspended by the European Union, because development is not about supporting the government – it is about supporting the people. Our view has always been that development cooperation constitutes an important element of our relations with Cuba. The ongoing projects in Cuba benefit the population directly by addressing their basic needs, through support for rehabilitation and reconstruction after the hurricanes, food security and adaptation to climate change. Projects are also being run in support of non-state actor activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to be very clear that there is no EC funding channelled through the government or public entities. The money is channelled via United Nations agencies and European NGOs, who welcome the presence of the Commission and the European Union in Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that the European Union continues to address the basic needs of the Cuban population while intervening in strategic sectors through the available thematic or geographical instruments. The task that the EU needs to face in a determined way is to find the right balance between showing openness to dialogue, supporting the Cuban population through development cooperation and reaffirming our principles.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, when my group asked for this matter to be included on the agenda, it did not do so in order to highlight errors, which are sometimes irreparable, in policies that indulge the enemies of freedom. It also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation.</p>
      <p sl="es">It did so in order that Parliament, which is the institution at the democratic heart of the European Union, could speak out to condemn the death of an innocent person, and, above all, to express its solidarity with those in Cuba who are fighting, living and dying, like Orlando Zapata, for their freedom and their dignity.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the European Commission said, the Council’s common position is still valid, and it is an honourable position because it asks for the immediate and unconditional release of political prisoners. It is also a consistent position, because it asks for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be respected, in order for Cuba to be rooted in our system of values and not in foreign systems such as those of China or Vietnam.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, the words of a brave man, Oswaldo Paya, who won the Sakharov Prize in 2002, still resound in this House. He said that the first victory to be proclaimed was that there was no hate in his heart. He said to those who oppressed him, who were his brothers, that he did not hate them, but that they were not going to impose their will through fear.</p>
      <p sl="es">He said that Andrei Sakharov left a legacy of dignity and of working towards peoples living together peacefully, and that often the voices that count the most are the voices that are not heard.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this House, we have not been able to hear the voices of the ‘Ladies in White’, who were also awarded the Sakharov Prize by Parliament. Now we will unfortunately not be able to hear the voice of Orlando Zapata, but soon we will be able to hear the voices of many more Cubans.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the meantime, Madam President, with the legitimacy that Parliament has in representing 500 million citizens from the 27 Member States of the Union, it needs to loudly and clearly echo the unstoppable shout of freedom that we are hearing from the beloved island of Cuba.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, let us never again allow our silence to result in us colluding with liberticide. Let us never again allow a person who fought for his rights and the rights of all to die in prison in Cuba, or anywhere else, without speaking out loudly and firmly to demand that he be saved.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year old black builder, who was only asking for his conditions in prison to be improved, died after 86 days on hunger strike and seven years in prison for demanding that human rights be respected. During this seven-year period, he was mistreated, humiliated and harassed by his guards, during which time – we should not forget – there was nothing but silence from the international community.</p>
      <p sl="es">Other prisoners and human rights activists in Cuba are currently on hunger strike, such as the psychologist and journalist Guillermo Fariñas. Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution that we are tabling and debating today, and which we will vote on tomorrow, which I represent on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, demands that all prisoners of conscience in Cuba be freed. Once again, it is in favour of a democratic transition, and of strict respect for fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">For the moment, let us not enter into a subject that divides us: whether the common position should be maintained or not. Let us focus now on saving lives and on human rights. Let us also open up a period of calm reflection in which we seek out points of agreement on future policy regarding Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="es">This text does, however, have significant added value. The fact that it is being tabled by six political groups expresses a new era of broad consensus in this House on the subject of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let it never again be said that European democratic law yields to the orders – in inverted commas – of Yankee imperialism. However, let it also never be said again that the socialists and democrats are complacent or complicit in communist dictatorships. I say this quite simply because both of these statements are false, and the victims of liberticide, wherever they may be, need to know that we are united in unconditionally defending their cause.</p>
      <p sl="es">Madam President, finally I would like to thank Mr Salafranca, who negotiated this text on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), Mrs Weber, from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mr Kožušník from the European Conservatives and Reformists, and other fellow Members who have taken part in this task, which has been difficult and complicated, but which I hope will be successful tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, on behalf of my political group, I would like first of all to express our condolences to the family of Mr Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who has paid the highest price for his convictions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over the years, his activism protecting human rights has been an inspiration to many other human rights advocates, inside and outside Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="de">The resolution which is proposed by several political groups expresses our deep concern about human rights conditions in Cuba. Let us be very honest. The situation has not improved and many independent journalists, peaceful dissidents and human rights defenders are still being imprisoned simply because they want to exercise their right to freedom of speech, peaceful meetings and assembly.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, Cuban independent NGOs are not allowed to work as the government exercises a draconian control over them.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the time of this debate, several human rights defenders are on hunger strike. This is a matter of concern as there are indications that Mr Guillermo Fariñas’ health, at least, is deteriorating rapidly.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is too bad that, so far, the Cuban authorities have disregarded the repeated calls from the EU to unconditionally release all political prisoners. This is why I strongly believe that this Parliament should ask the EU to continue to use all possible mechanisms to guarantee the work, and the lives, of those who aspire to a pluralistic and democratic Cuba.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would also like to join personally and on behalf of my group in offering condolences for the death of Orlando Zapata.</p>
      <p sl="es">Irrespective of each person’s opinion with regard to Cuba, this is obviously a regrettable incident in itself, which deserves our condemnation and certainly something more than reflection and remembrance. This event merits the coherent wording of the request that we make in this resolution, which is for those detained for their political motives or motivation in Cuba and anywhere in the world to be freed.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that what we are doing is coherent, I think that it needs to be done, and I think that it is important that we also do it – I would like to stress this – irrespective of the motivations that might be behind it. This is part of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also need to ask for these people to be freed immediately, in the case of Cuba, and, above all, recall the delicate situation – as has been mentioned – of some of the people who, following the example of Orlando Zapata, began a hunger strike, especially the case of Guillermo Fariñas.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I would also like to warn about the risk of using and exploiting this case politically for other issues which, as Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo has said, could be dangerous. I think it is important to remember that there are many processes under way that are useful, that are working, and that we should not, under any circumstances, be tempted – as some seem to want – to return to past events, to times gone by; to return to the political failure of the embargo, because we know the consequences of that.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, if we agree that we do not want situations such as that of Orlando Zapata to be repeated, I think it is important that we know how we can move forward together to prevent it from being repeated, starting with facilitating the process of democratisation and normalisation of the island.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I was personally very upset about the death of Orlando Zapata, and I would therefore like, on behalf of the entire ECR group, to express condolences to all of his family. I myself was born in 1971, at the peak of the so-called communist normalisation in my country, which was one of the harshest periods of communist terror that my country went through. The experience which my country had with the criminal ideology of communism is the reason for the great solidarity of Czech citizens with the Cuban people, and we are therefore very sensitive to the sad news that has recently come out of Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Given that the totalitarian regime in Cuba is still asserting the slogan ‘socialism or death’, forty years after the Cuban revolution, it deserves no tolerance whatsoever. I believe that Orlando Zapata’s death was not in vain and that it will rouse the Cuban people to mass resistance against the communist regime. When Pavel Wonka died in a communist prison as the last victim of communist terror in my own country, the regime collapsed within a year and a half. I hope that Orlando Zapata will be the Cuban Pavel Wonka, in other words, the last victim of communist despotism. Cuba will perhaps soon break free from the grip of the revolutionary old guard and will become a true island of freedom.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I therefore appeal to you. Until there is fundamental and irreversible progress in the release of political prisoners, progress leading to the democratic functioning of the Cuban society and the holding of free elections, as well as a start to the process of structural reforms leading, among other things, to a better standard of living for all Cuban citizens, then it is impossible to consider opening talks on a reassessment of the EU’s common position.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, my group deeply regrets the death of the prisoner Orlando Zapata. As is the case for any prisoner, the State was responsible for his safety and for his life. In this case, it is Cuba that is responsible, and we therefore deeply regret his death.</p>
      <p sl="es">We do not agree with the way that this House manipulates the issue of human rights. Today, we are debating this issue and tomorrow we will vote on it. We did not do this for the military coup in Honduras. This House might be the only parliament in the world that did not condemn or vote against the military coup in Honduras, with its murders and torture.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore do not agree with the philosophy that it depends on where it is happening, which human right is being violated and what the situation is as to whether we need to give an opinion or not.</p>
      <p sl="es">A week ago, the largest mass grave in Latin America was discovered in Colombia. The authorities themselves are talking about 2 500 bodies, and this may rise to up to 50 000. Is this being condemned? Is this being discussed, voted on and condemned? What is happening with the civilian victims in Afghanistan? What is happening with the persecution in the Western Sahara? No! We will not be part of this hypocrisy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that the fundamental issue is that we establish an equal relationship with the Republic of Cuba in order to tackle all the agendas: the political agendas, the human rights agendas, the penitentiary situation, but on an equal footing, because the European Union still has a common position with the Republic of Cuba, which is the exception to the rule. It does not have a common position with any other country in the world. It does not have one with the People’s Republic of China, which has been mentioned, or with Vietnam. Why is this? Why does it have one with Cuba and not with the People’s Republic of China?</p>
      <p sl="es">I call on the Council, on the President of the Council, to clearly raise the following question: is the common position going to be ended? It is, in my opinion, one of the most obvious obstacles to moving forward with a frank dialogue between the European Union and the Republic of Cuba, with common, shared agendas that are of mutual interest.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the death of the dissident Orlando Zapata as a result of a hunger strike and the arrest of the blogger Yoani Sánchez, who told the world about day-to-day life in Socialist Cuba, make clear that we must continue with the link established in our Cuba policy in 1996 with progress on democratisation and human rights. Hopes for progress under Raúl Castro, of course, have long since vanished into thin air.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation of political prisoners, for example, has not really improved. They still do not enjoy anything like the freedoms that the Castro brothers themselves were afforded during their imprisonment during the Batista dictatorship. With its stubborn adherence to the planned economy, Cuba is no longer even capable of meeting the most basic needs of its own population. In Cuba, prosperity and self-initiative are clearly regarded as criticism of the regime. In that regard, even the people of Communist China have things easier in that they can at least improve their lives through their own efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The relaxation of the United States’ economic embargo in respect of computers and software services will not be entirely able to meet the expectations that the public has drawn from President Obama’s promises, but it will perhaps make it possible for the opposition to be better organised. Not least, it will also be harder for the Cuban regime, with increasing choice, to suppress the free expression of opinion. For this reason alone, we should support Europe’s initiatives as best we can and push for further relaxations in the Communist system.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The tragic death of the Cuban prisoner of conscience, Orlando Zapata, is further proof that the regime of the Castro brothers is ignoring the appeals of the international community to end violations of human rights, quietly getting rid of those who demand freedom and democracy. Today, this tragedy, this tragic death, has acquired symbolic significance. It is a desperate cry for help and for effective action, principally from international politicians and decision makers, who, while building relations with the Cuban authorities, do not want to talk to people from the opposition, and are turning a deaf ear to the voice of the representatives of civil society in Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must, as quickly as possible, take concerted action to put pressure on the Castro regime and demand the immediate release of those have been sentenced to many years of imprisonment for their views.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In recent years, the European Union has been trying to soften its stance and has even lifted diplomatic sanctions against Cuba, in the hope that this gesture will encourage the authorities to respect democratic standards. Unfortunately, the tragic death of Orlando Zapata shows that this policy is naive, ineffective and very clearly should not be continued.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Tomorrow, we are going to vote on the resolution to wind up today’s debate. This should be a clear signal of our opposition to the violations of human rights, the inhumane treatment of political prisoners and the lack of respect for fundamental civil liberties in Cuba.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the tragic fate of Orlando Zapata Tamayo has led to deep indignation the world over. In his hopeless situation, Zapata felt the only option open to him was to kill himself by hunger strike. He has had to pay with his life for his protests against his imprisonment and the appalling conditions in his Cuban prison. And why? What crime did Zapata commit which led to him being in that prison in the first place? Expressing and propagating in a non-violent way an opinion other than that of the government is no crime. That does not make you a criminal or a traitor.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Zapata’s death is no isolated incident. The psychologist and journalist, Guillermo Fariñas, has also started a hunger strike, because he wants to bring about the release of 26 sick political prisoners. What fate awaits him? Will he, too, soon pay with his life for his campaign for respect for human rights? When is the Cuban Government going to alter its position? It is estimated that there are around 200 other political prisoners in Cuba. Detaining people for their ideals runs totally counter to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We call on Cuba to directly and unconditionally release these prisoners of conscience and to put an end to this gross violation of human rights. No government can control or govern its people’s thinking. Even if you imprison people behind walls or put them behind bars, their ideas will continue to survive. Any attempt to stamp out such thoughts and ideas will always fail. Has Cuba not already had years of experience of this?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The government will simply have to enter into dialogue with people who hold dissenting views. Political dialogue is the only instrument for moving forward. That is what Cuba owes its citizens, because the Cuban people deserve democracy and respect for their fundamental freedoms. Zapata’s death must not be allowed to go down in history as meaningless; it must mark an end to the current human rights situation in Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Union must do everything within its power to help improve the human rights situation in Cuba. This is not just a question of political prisoners like Zapata; it is also a question of defenders of human rights being able to freely go about their work. The Cuban Government must take care of the Cuban people. It cannot simply detain people or treat them as criminals, out of fear. Depriving citizens of their freedom is a crime.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, defending human rights means condemning the avoidable, cruel and unjust death of Orlando Zapata and calling for those who are still in prison to be released. I hope that this will make the Cuban authorities think, as their regime needs to make progress so that their citizens can enjoy true democracy.</p>
      <p sl="es">In Cuba, there is a dictatorship because there are prisoners of conscience, because there is fear of debate, free exchange of ideas and plans, because there is fear of freedom. It is not a crime to have ideas; they can provoke, surprise and shock, but they always need to be argued and debated. They never require imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Societies think and feel, and so do prisoners, and it is impossible to forbid people from thinking and feeling. This means that the ideas and feelings that people want to repress end up seeping into the consciousness of the whole of society, like water. This is true for Cuban society as well and the protagonists of the revolution that put an end to the regime of Fulgencio Batista should know this more than anyone.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that this resolution helps them to make the transition that they need to make! However, human rights are non-negotiable. Parliament gains in credibility when it reacts with the same strength to all human rights violations in all countries: in Afghanistan, in Palestine, in the Basque Country – my little country – in Honduras and in Colombia.

Promoting democratic change is an area in which transatlantic ties may play a very important role. This is why we should cooperate closely with Washington.

Proof of this are the circumstances which led to the death of the Cuban prisoner and patriot, Orlando Zapata. Castro’s dictatorial rule is a disgrace to the idea of democratic socialism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is happening in Cuba brings disgrace upon all who are involved in politics under these Left-wing banners. I was ashamed of the European Union, too, when the then Commissioner, Mr Michel, visited Cuba with a proposal of cooperation on development, but carefully avoided contact with the democratic opposition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must end this kind of policy, this closing our eyes to the reality of a country in which there have never been free elections, and where prisoners of conscience are serving prison sentences of many years in scandalous conditions. The Spanish Presidency is, today, proposing operating an open policy towards Havana, but an essential condition of this policy must be democratisation of the Cuban regime, release of political prisoners, commencement of dialogue with society, lifting of censorship and restoration of civil liberties. This should be clearly, openly and firmly said to the government in Cuba. Besides, it is in their interest.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We know there are different ways to freedom for people oppressed by dictators. There is the path taken by Poland and South Africa – the way of dialogue and understanding. However, there is also the path which Romania took in its bloody overthrow of the regime. It is in everyone’s interest to avoid such a scenario. Which path will Havana choose?

      <p sl="en">The European Parliament should reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of prisoners of conscience in Cuba – 55 according to Amnesty International, 200 according to Cuba’s Human Rights Commission – and we should express particular concern today for the recent detention and beating of Darsi Ferrer, director of a health and human rights centre in Havana. Amnesty International itself has not been invited to visit Cuba for 19 years and should be allowed to do so. We should ask the Cuban Government to agree specific dates for the proposed visit of Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, who we intend to meet in Geneva next week.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I am one of the people in this House who has always opposed the US embargo on trade, inflicted since 1962, I have welcomed the fact that under President Obama, measures have been approved to allow Cuban Americans to travel more freely as well as sending more money home. I welcomed the review in 2008 of our EU common position leading to the establishment of a political dialogue between Cuba and the EU and re-establishing EC development cooperation, and I welcome the fact that the BBC has recently been given free access to Cuba. But I express disappointment that, in the United Nations Human Rights Council, Cuba has failed to agree the recommendations to ratify the two key human rights conventions – the ICCPR and the ICESCR – and to allow independent inspection of prisons.</p>
      <p sl="en">I say to the Commission and to the Presidency this afternoon that you – and all of us who visit Cuba – should remain firm in ensuring that we meet members of Cuban civil society.

We cannot support the arbitrariness of a power that obstinately refuses to embrace the exercising of the most fundamental freedoms, but it is my belief that we cannot deprive ourselves of the virtues of, and prospects for, a political dialogue, which, now more than ever, remains the most tangible expression of our European values.</p>

We all know that Cuba is today at a turning point in its history. More than ever, I remain convinced that we would be wrong not to preserve the advantages and advances, however modest, of a dialogue sustained by particular historical, cultural and linguistic links.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union is, without doubt, the only political power capable of convincing the Cubans that the isolation in which they are confining themselves is suicidal and can only lead them, sooner or later, to a tragic fate.

The same applies to Cuba. I firmly believe that the only way to improve the situation in Cuba is through a dialogue of equals, which Cuban officials are ready for. In this way, we can also help to improve social and economic rights in Cuba. We must not forget that Cuba, despite its difficult economic situation, is always in the first rank of countries providing assistance to others, for example, in the disaster in Haiti. It is true that he who is quick to condemn likes to condemn. We should definitely not take this path.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly believe I can declare that we will write a worthy page in the history of this Parliament today and even more so tomorrow when we vote. We are writing it because for once, putting aside our mutual prejudices due to our membership of different groups, we bow down before the supreme mystery of a man’s death and acknowledge the truth.</p>
      <p sl="it">What will we actually write in this resolution? We will write things that may seem simple and go without saying but that are actually very important. We will write that in Cuba, there is no freedom; we will write that in Cuba, there is no democracy; we will write that life is life and people should not be killed. We may take this almost for granted, but it has taken us many years to overcome our mutual prejudice and to recognise a fact that does not offend each of our political faiths, but simply leads us to recognise the basic grain of truth that is the only foundation for discussion.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must not avoid discussions with Cuba, but must instead insist that any true discussion should stem from the truth, in other words, its failure to recognise the central importance of the individual. What we need, more than handshakes and friendly gestures, are appropriate measures, causing Castro’s government to give up any hope of achieving compromises that would attach no importance, or at least only secondary importance, to the question of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament has, quite rightly, seized this opportunity, unlike the High Representative, who I will again remind, as I did this morning, that Cuba libre is not the name of a cocktail: it is a rallying cry that we carry in our hearts, because we want democracy, and we want Cuba to be free.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the Spanish Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament deeply regret the death of Orlando Zapata, and the situation of the prisoners of conscience, and we very firmly call for their release.</p>
      <p sl="es">The death of Orlando Zapata is regrettable, but it might also be a trigger for us to stop talking about human rights in Cuba and start working for human rights with the Cuban authorities, to promote human rights in Cuba. In order to do this, we need to begin thinking about changing the common position that is preventing us from having any dialogue with the Cuban authorities, who have the capacity to change the human rights situation on the island.</p>
      <p sl="es">The common position – which, incidentally, is not so common, because a large proportion of the European Union Member States have bilateral relations with Cuba – is an obstacle that is hindering any possibility of political dialogue. It is an obstacle to the European Union implementing the principles that are behind its external action, which include promoting democracy and human rights in the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">The common position is an outmoded, outdated instrument adopted last century by 15 Member States of the European Union. Now we have 27 Member States. The situation in the world has changed. The United States is holding a dialogue with Cuba on issues as sensitive as immigration. The Organisation of American States has admitted Cuba, on the basis of dialogue in the context of respect for the principles behind the Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this new era for the European Union, we need a bilaterally negotiated instrument that will enable us to be effective at doing what the European Union is effective at, which is promoting democracy and human rights. It is an oddity for the European Union to block dialogue with Cuba since, in its external relations, it has negotiated and is implementing agreements with countries that do not meet the minimum standards for civil and political rights and, of course, in terms of social rights either, which Cuba does.</p>
      <p sl="es">Only dialogue, the mechanisms of cooperation and compromise through an international treaty will enable the European Union to demand anything from Cuba, and those who refuse dialogue are obstructing the search for a dignified way out for those that they claim to be defending.</p>
      <p sl="es">By contrast, the foreign policy of the Spanish Government has set a good example, as through constructive, exacting dialogue, a considerable number of prisoners of conscience have been released.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Don Quixote said, if someone is punished through actions, they do not need to be punished through words. We are therefore going to stop talking and start working for human rights in Cuba, in cooperation with the Cuban authorities, which is what the prisoners of conscience need, rather than condemnations from this House.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the 2003 ‘black spring’ raids in Cuba, 75 dissidents were imprisoned, accused of being spies for the United States. Orlando Zapata was arrested at the same time for disrespect, public disorder and disobedience.</p>
      <p sl="es">The wives of the 75 dissidents formed the ‘Ladies in White’ group, which was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought by Parliament in 2005. Incidentally, I would like to point out that the Castro regime did not grant visas to the ‘Ladies in White’ to come here to Parliament to collect their prize.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Cuban Human Rights Commission recognises that there are around 200 political prisoners there, 22 of whom are journalists. Cuba is third in the sad world ranking of imprisoned journalists, behind Iran with 52 and China with 24.</p>
      <p sl="es">Orlando Zapata, aged 42, was declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. He began a hunger strike on 3 December 2009 due to the repeated beatings that he received and other ill treatment, and died on 23 February, 85 days after he began his hunger strike.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament should express its support for the family and friends of Mr Zapata and express its great concern at the state of human rights in Cuba. This House should send a clear message to the Castro regime, especially in the context of the Spanish Presidency. The Spanish Presidency should, incidentally, be much more active in defending fundamental rights in Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to call for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, democracy and defending human rights have an important place among the Union’s principles and objectives for external action – I refer to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. This Article also applies to relations with Cuba and with the Cuban people, who are very dear to us.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, in the last five years, the Council’s actions appear to have been essentially governed by a desire to correct the line adopted in previous years, especially in 2003 when there was an extremely harsh wave of oppression in Cuba. In 2005, the Council suspended the 2003 measures.</p>
      <p sl="es">Subsequently, there were trips to the island by foreign ministers and commissioners. In June 2008, the 2003 measures were lifted and a global political dialogue was established – as Mr López Garrido reminded us – along with regular high-level meetings. A Head of State of a Member State even recently visited Havana. Unfortunately, the European political leaders who went to the island did not have any time to meet with the representatives of the dissidents, who therefore felt marginalised.</p>
      <p sl="es">Over all this time, repression in Cuba has continued. There have been no changes or reforms. Nevertheless, political dialogue has been maintained. Now we are all shaken up by the cruel death of the political prisoner, Orlando Zapata.</p>
      <p sl="es">As is well known, ladies and gentlemen, some governments, such as the Spanish Government, have repeatedly said that they want to cancel the common position. It says something very logical: support for democratic transition, essentially the same thing that is required by the principles and objectives of Article 21 of the treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will conclude with two points. The common position has not hindered dialogue. This is obvious. What is more, it was reconfirmed recently by the 27 ministers, in June 2009. Secondly, the priority cannot be to change the common position – that would be the last straw! The priority now is to ask for the immediate, complete and unconditional release of all political prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="es">I see Cuba and Latin America as Western, and the symbols that identify the West are the dignity of human beings and respect for their fundamental rights. I have a final thought: I would like to remind the Council that, in its own conclusions in June 2009, it said that the future of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities was dependent on progress being made, in particular, on human rights. Can anyone say that this progress is taking place today? Can anyone really say that?</p>

The judgment of history is clear.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, the choices and conduct of the Cuban communist regime create a dilemma for our Parliament: is it possible to carry on holding discussions with this regime? For years now, the European Parliament has been asking the Cuban authorities for democratic reforms that respect human rights. But the handover of power from Fidel Castro to his brother, Raúl, has led neither to democratic reforms, nor to the release of political prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="it">The death of Orlando Zapata in prison, after 85 days of hunger strike, demonstrates the ideological and oppressive nature of the regime. For 10 years, the European Union has financed EUR 145 million of aid measures to Cuba: the results have been far from brilliant. In fact, this funding has helped to keep tyranny alive. If we want to be credible, we must demand that relations with Havana, including development aid, are tied in to specific and verifiable improvements in the human rights situation for all Cuban citizens, beginning with the immediate release of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we should make a tangible offer to the people of Cuba, and also to the island’s regime: in place of the political status quo, we will fund a transition to democracy in Cuba. The first step must be the release of all political prisoners. In parallel, the United States should end its sanctions, which have helped to cement the regime in place rather than to overcome it. The next step should be for a round table composed of representatives of the regime and of the civil rights movement based in Cuba to draw up a schedule for the transition to democracy and for democratic elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">Incidentally, Central Europe shows that there is still a future for the former State party – even for that party, then, there is life after the death of the old system. We, as the EU and as Member States, should support this process in a similar way to how we did in Central Europe.

      <p sl="pt">Regardless of the viewpoint of each person with respect to the choices of the Cuban people, those choices and their sovereign right to decide their destiny and the form of political organisation of their state must be respected.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I am addressing my speech to Orlando Zapata’s mother and to those suffering along with him in the fight for freedom in Cuba: they are not alone.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today, through this resolution – for which, in my capacity as Secretary-General of my party, I would like to thank the authors, and especially all the parties that have signed it – Parliament is speaking out as one against this isolated and decrepit dictatorship. Today, we are signing the beginning of the international death sentence for this regime.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am convinced, based on the majority of the speeches that I have heard, that we are all united in firmly and clearly condemning the death of your son. Many of us, however, are going further than this statement: you can rest assured that we will remain vigilant in order to secure the unconditional release of all political prisoners on the island.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will remain vigilant regarding the situation of human rights violations on the island. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will, of course, fight to maintain the European Union’s common position, and I am sure based on what I have heard that many others will do the same.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will not give mixed signals, but rather a clear guide for achieving our dream of seeing a democratic Cuba.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, for us, it is relatively easy to talk, when human rights violations take place elsewhere and people are also dying for their beliefs. It is important to make this point. Mr Zapata really has lost his life as a result of his hunger strike, and there are also other prisoners who have now been prompted to go on hunger strike.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need, therefore, to give specific thought to how we can move forwards in a targeted way. Some have said that we absolutely should not talk to Cuba because the regime there is unacceptable to us. Others – and I do not think this position is a good one at all, Mr Ferreira – have expressed the opinion that there is hypocrisy here and that the people of Cuba should be allowed the freedom to make their own political decisions. I believe that the freedom to make political decisions really stops where human rights are violated and people die. In those circumstances we, as the European Parliament, must do something.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against that backdrop, it is absolutely right for the specific proposals that have been laid on the table – not least including a few new suggestions from Mr Gahler – to be discussed in detail and for us to consider what we can do to intervene against human rights violations all over the world and to help the people of the world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, as we are discussing our relations with Cuba here today in the shadow of the tragic death of Orlando Zapata, we must acknowledge that the view that we have had of Cuba does date from a time when our thoughts were defined by a friend-or-foe framework. We had, on the one hand, the bad Cubans who were vassals of the Soviet Union intent on pursuing international revolution and, on the other hand, the good Cubans, who rescued the country from the grip of the sugar barons, the mafia, the CIA and US imperialism. On one side were the bad Cubans, the Communist oppressors of the people, and on the other those who provided the population with education, medical care and an end to their hunger. Today, if the death of Orlando Zapata is to make sense – if death can ever make sense – we should, at all events, take this legacy very seriously. This death must not be in vain.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other thing that must happen is that the EU must pursue clear routes, dedicated political routes, and must not allow us to be put under the yoke of the States; we must be free of the old ideological encumbrances and we must be on an equal footing in the political dialogue and push for there to be clear improvements in the human rights situation so that we will soon be able to talk of a free Cuba and the people of the island will be able to live in democracy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, the USA’s trade embargo has been in place for almost 50 years. The embargo has brought poverty and oppression to the people of Cuba, as many different speakers have highlighted.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Many people will be familiar with the report produced by Human Rights Watch in November 2009 entitled ‘New Castro, Same Cuba’ which proposed that the embargo should be lifted and that Cuba’s dictators should have six months in which to release political prisoners. If they were unable to do this, then a more intelligent embargo should be introduced. This would be of the type which has been used on occasions recently and which involves freezing assets and foreign investment and putting in place a ban on travel. The major democratic states and the EU should, of course, support this. It would be interesting to know what the President-in-Office of the Council thinks of this proposal from Human Rights Watch.</p>

I am wondering about the Spanish Government, which is chairing the European Union at this time, because their proposal does not address the situation. The immediate release of political prisoners is quite difficult. And so I ask Commissioner Piebalgs to have the European Commission enter into negotiations with the Cuban Government to allow the International Red Cross to visit Cuban political prisoners. This would enable an objective assessment of their condition and help in further negotiations. The Red Cross was allowed to do this at the Guantánamo prison.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I believe that the debate that we have had regarding the issue of the situation of prisoners of conscience in Cuba, due to the death of one of them, Orlando Zapata, shows that there is a high level of agreement between Members and political groups. I am certain that this will be demonstrated tomorrow in the vote that is to take place on the resolutions resulting from this debate, which are basically in line with the position of the Council, the Commission and all the European Union institutions. This undoubtedly strengthens the European Union in this essential dialogue with Cuba and in the objective of advancing and improving the lot of the Cuban people.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that we can agree that we need to speak out immediately in any place where there is a violation of human rights. I think this is a fundamental principle that has been highlighted, and it should always be measured using the same yardstick.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union must come to the fore as soon as there is a violation of human rights, because that is part of its very personality. In this case, we are doing so in relation to Cuba, by saying and demanding that all the remaining prisoners of conscience in Cuba should be released and that human rights should be respected there.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is not all, however: we need to work effectively and be effective, achieve results that improve the well-being and living conditions of prisoners of conscience or even make it possible for them to be released.</p>
      <p sl="es">In some cases, this has been achieved, and in some cases, progress has been made. This is because, amongst other things, there is a fundamental element of European Union policy in relation to Cuba, which is political dialogue. This dialogue was resumed recently – which I believe is a good thing – and, by putting an end to the sanctions which were part of the European Union’s position, and which did not make any sense at all, and resuming this political dialogue, it has been possible to do something that had not been possible since 2003: talking to the Cuban authorities about prisoners of conscience.</p>
      <p sl="es">Naturally, the evaluation that some of you have mentioned, the evaluation of the result of this dialogue, will have to take place periodically, and there will have to be an evaluation of this process this year. Many of you – I am referring, for example, to the speeches by Mr Mauro, Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo or Mr Michel – have highlighted the importance of this dialogue, of this cooperation, and of the moral authority that the European Union has to talk to Cuba and achieve progress, which is the ultimate aim.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore welcome the majority agreement in this House regarding the human rights situation in Cuba, which I believe can be summarised in one message: although we continue to be open to dialogue with Cuba, the European Union is going to continue to demand that all political prisoners be freed there and that the civil and political rights of Cuban citizens be respected.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Orlando Zapata Tamayo, arrested in 2003 with a group of 75 other dissidents during a crackdown on opposition groups carried out by the authorities, died following a two-month hunger strike in a Cuban prison. I hope the tragic death of one of Cuba’s best known political prisoners has reminded everyone that the question of human rights in Cuba has not been settled.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I fully agree with the demands of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and many human rights organisations that the governments of European states should put pressure on the Cuban authorities for the unconditional release of political prisoners, with the threat of blocking every attempt at improving EU-Cuba relations. I am of the opinion that the complete lifting of sanctions against Cuba by the European Union, without negotiating the actual release of all political prisoners, was premature. At the same time, I would like to stress that the citizens of Cuba should not pay for the mistakes of the people who make such decisions. It is high time the country took specific steps towards democratisation, building civil society and respecting human rights, in particular, freedom of speech and association.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to echo the words of the former Prime Minister of Spain, José María Aznar, and say it is unacceptable that, during visits to Cuba, European politicians refuse to meet representatives of the opposition.

      <p sl="en">The premature death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, after seven years of illegal imprisonment against which he was left with only one means of protest, must be seen as the responsibility of the repressive Cuban regime. It is our responsibility to keep in mind the words of Orlando Zapata’s mother: ‘You should not have to go through what my son had to experience’. During the last four years of Raúl Castro’s leadership, expectations that the Communist dictatorship in Cuba could become more human have clearly been disappointed. People there continue to risk their lives when voicing their opinion. There are still about 200 political prisoners in Cuba. Both the USA and the EU Member States have condemned the death of Mr Zapata, yet this protest has not been strong or timely enough. In cases like this, one cannot, like the Spanish Presidency, waste any time in reacting. The moral of Zapata’s case is that one cannot ignore the harsh realities of the Cuban dictatorship. Our policy towards Cuba must remain conditional on genuine changes there. The EU has to take the side of the Cuban people rather than cherish hopes that Zapata’s murderers can be trusted.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, increased cooperation with third countries – with countries of origin and transit in migration – is a key element for the European Union in terms of combating illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="es">This has been one of the major changes, developments and advances that have taken place as a result of what is known as the global approach to immigration and the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum. Cooperation with countries that are the source of migration is one of the most important elements of the new immigration policy – before 2004, there was practically no immigration policy in the European Union – and one of the prime elements of the policy that arose following the Hampton Court meeting in 2004 is cooperation with countries of origin and transit for illegal migration.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I said, this is part of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, and in this respect, in its conclusions in December last year on enlargement, the Council welcomed the initiation of strengthened dialogue on migration with Turkey, and asked for specific measures to be adopted, for example readmission, border controls, etc.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Stockholm Programme has reaffirmed the need to act against illegal immigration, and, furthermore, it is clear from the Stockholm Programme and from the Council’s conclusions of December 2009, that we need to conclude readmission agreements with Turkey and, in the meantime, apply the existing bilateral agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can tell you that the last round of negotiations on this readmission agreement took place only last month, on 19 February in Ankara, and the Council is going to continue to support the Commission in its efforts to secure the most favourable conclusion possible to these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must also cite the collaboration and cooperation between Frontex and Turkey. Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 facilitates this operational cooperation between Member States and third countries, and it should also be said that negotiations are taking place on an agreement such as that mentioned in this Regulation between Frontex and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an operational task involving exchanging information, analysing risks, research and coordinated joint Frontex operations. This is the framework in which operational cooperation is now developing between the Agency and the Turkish authorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">We hope that these negotiations end as soon as possible, in a fruitful way, and, in any event, the Member States will be kept informed of any future developments.</p>

      <p sl="el">Thank you very much for your reply. I should like to make a further two comments.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first is that, today or tomorrow, in tandem with today’s debate, the Greek Parliament will be voting on a legislative initiative by the Greek Government which makes it easier and more flexible to acquire Greek nationality than in the past. Of course, this makes Greece even more attractive to immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, who believe that at some point in the future, they will be able to regularise their status. I should like, from a strategic point of view, to hear if the Presidency thinks this is a good move.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, it was announced in February that Frontex is to create its first outpost in Piraeus, in order to strengthen its presence in the Aegean. Is there any specific timetable for this?</p>

      <p sl="es">Honourable Member, I cannot tell you now precisely what the timetable will be for these negotiations that are taking place. What is certain is that the political will for them to succeed is there. The information that you refer to regarding Greece highlights the need and the opportunity for the fight against illegal immigration to be strengthened through these readmission agreements.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to support these conversations, these negotiations, which are basically conducted by the Commission. I must remind you that before the end of last year, there was a visit by Minister Billström, on behalf of the Swedish Presidency, and Mr Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission, to Turkey, on 5 November 2009.</p>
      <p sl="es">This visit was followed by contact from the Commission. With regard to the new Commission, this case is essentially under the remit of Mrs Malmström, who knows the Stockholm Programme very well because she was involved in making it a reality and putting it together. I am optimistic that the information that you are referring to can be compensated for through much stronger regulation of readmission agreements, real readmission agreements with Turkey. I cannot give you a precise timetable for them at the moment, but I can tell you that the Presidency of the Council and the Commission have a strong desire for these readmission agreements with Turkey to be achieved. We do not only want agreements with Turkey, but also with other countries which are sometimes countries of origin or of transit for illegal migration.</p>
      <p sl="es">I must also tell you that the Frontex agreements, in this case with Turkey, are directly managed by Frontex. In many cases, they are technical and operational conversations, and although the Council as an institution is not involved in those negotiations, it is kept informed of them and will, of course, inform the rest of the Member States in any case, which naturally includes Greece.</p>

I should therefore like you to tell us, I should like to know if the basis for these talks between Turkey and Frontex is respect for the border between Greece and Turkey, in other words, recognition of, and respect for, the external borders of the EU. I would remind you that, to date, the harassment of Frontex aircraft by Turkey has been based on this dispute.</p>

      <p sl="en">My fear is that sometimes we fail to protect the rights of our own citizens when they move from one country to another. I think particularly of some of my East Midlands constituents who have spent their retirement savings on a home in Spain only to find, after living there for two or three years, that they have the bulldozers at the door and their rights of property, their rights to the enforcement of contract, are simply ignored by the Spanish courts and the Spanish authorities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, with regard to the question on Greece, of course, the borders of the Member States of the Union are to be respected. The very objective of these agreements is for those borders to be respected.</p>
      <p sl="es">When there is an agreement with a third country through which illegal immigration may pass, and there is a readmission agreement – which is the objective – and therefore the European Union’s agreements with that third country are strengthened – which is the global approach and the philosophy of the European Pact on Immigration – what is happening is that the borders of the Member States of the Union are being strengthened. That is the effect. If we do not have this effective control of illegal immigration because there is insufficient cooperation with other countries, because there are no readmission agreements, those borders are weakened in practice. The objective of these negotiations and readmission agreements is therefore clearly to strengthen borders, which of course includes Greece’s borders.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the question from the honourable Member about British citizens that have moved to Spain and invested some of their savings there, I must say that I am obviously not here representing Spain as a country in its judicial relations with citizens who are there, but rather I am representing the Council of the Union. Those relations or any problems that there may be are settled in the independent courts of the Spanish State. I will therefore refrain from speaking on behalf of a specific country on specific matters that are not relevant to European Union law.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 2 by Marian Harkin (H-0053/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Domestic violence</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the Spanish Presidency’s statement at the plenary session in January 2010, the Presidency highlighted its firm intention to combat violence against women, to propose draft legislation to fight violence against women, and to establish a European Observatory of Domestic Violence. Can the Presidency elaborate on what exactly its plans are in this area and when we can expect such initiatives to be put in place?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-414" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, it is well known that one of the priorities for the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the Union is the fight against gender violence, in other words, equality between men and women in the European Union, which has not been fully achieved 50 years after the birth of the Union. Violence against women is, above all, the greatest form of discrimination, the greatest scourge in European society and other societies in the world, in fact, unfortunately, of practically all societies.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is an essential objective for the Presidency, because we believe it is an essential objective for Europe. For this reason, as it is an objective for Europe, a problem with a European dimension, in order to combat this phenomenon, we also need a European strategy. This has been included not only in the programme of the Spanish Presidency, but also in the 18-month programme of the Trio of Presidencies, with Belgium and Hungary.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are glad that Parliament is an institution that has always played a very active role in this field and has made repeated calls for measures in this respect, against gender violence. For example, in a resolution that it adopted in November last year, Parliament urged the Commission to draw up a general directive on measures to prevent and combat all forms of gender violence. Parliament also urged the Member States to produce more detailed statistics on gender violence.</p>
      <p sl="es">Echoing Parliament’s position, the Spanish Presidency, as I said, considered this to be a crucial issue. More specifically, it has initiated the creation of an observatory on gender violence by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO), which adopted conclusions on this on 8 March, International Women’s Day, which was on Monday. The directive on the protection order against gender violence is also being drawn up. These are two very important, fundamental issues which we hope can be developed and finalised before the six-month Spanish Presidency of the European Council comes to an end.</p>

    <intervention id="3-415" speaker_id="28116" name="Marian Harkin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Thank you, Minister, and I congratulate the Spanish Presidency on highlighting the issue of gender-based violence. Too often, that issue is literally kept behind closed doors, because that is where most of the violence happens: in the family home. I believe that your initiative will certainly lead to greater public awareness across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">You spoke of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament in November 2009. One of the things that resolution asked for was the possibility of establishing a clear legal basis in this area. I wonder whether you would be supportive of the Commission drafting a comprehensive directive on action to prevent gender violence, and what your view is on establishing a clear legal basis.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-416" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mrs Harkin, as you know, the Treaty of Lisbon changes the legal bases for European law – for regulations and directives – because it brings together in the Community pillar what was previously three different pillars: the Community pillar, foreign and security policy, and justice and home affairs.</p>
      <p sl="es">These things have been brought together in a single pillar and a single legal personality, and this means that the normal, traditional Community method is being introduced for foreign policy and for the more specific area of judicial affairs – judicial cooperation on civil and criminal matters – and for police cooperation. This means the Commission and also Parliament having a greater presence at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the area of cooperation in criminal matters, there is a possibility that still remains, which is that a quarter of European Union governments can take initiatives in this area. This is what happened with the directive on gender violence: Twelve governments have presented an initiative on which the Council and Parliament will have to adopt a final decision, because it is an ordinary legislative procedure matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">This directive is already being prepared and is in response to the possibility established by the treaty for governments to take this initiative, and which, in our view, has a correct, adequate legal basis, because it concerns judicial cooperation on criminal matters.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are talking about crimes involving ill treatment, violence against a person, something which is a crime in all the countries of the Union. This is therefore about protecting the victims of that crime. Its legal basis is in cooperation on criminal matters, and we understand that it is therefore perfectly possible – as the legal services of the Council have said – for it to be implemented through this legal text, which will have to be examined and debated in this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that this will happen quickly, because I believe that it is what millions of women, and also men, in the European Union are waiting for. They are waiting for this protection, which – as you rightly said – now needs to come out from behind closed doors, not only at national level but also at European level. It needs to become part of the European agenda. This is the aim of the initiative presented by 12 European Union governments.</p>

      <p sl="en">I wish to join Mrs Harkin in congratulating the Spanish Presidency on putting violence against women at the top of its political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wonder if the Presidency would look at an experience 20 years ago. Edinburgh City Council, financed by European Social Fund money, conducted a campaign called ‘Zero Tolerance’ in relation to violence against women.</p>
      <p sl="en">Its conclusion was that you need a holistic approach to this issue. You need information policy, you need housing authorities involved, you need the police involved and you need the judicial authorities involved.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr López Garrido, you did briefly mention that domestic violence is, of course, not only directed against women, but also against children, and domestic violence is also an issue in relation to the care of the elderly, as a result of excessive demands. To what extent will these areas of domestic violence, too, be included in the remit of the planned European Observatory of Domestic Violence?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-419" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mr Martin, of course, the underlying philosophy behind this initiative – which is supported by Parliament, with regard to regulation, in this case through legal channels, through the most effective channels possible, the judicial channels of a democratic state – is what was rightly called ‘zero tolerance’ of gender violence. It involves seeing gender violence as something which, for centuries, has been very deeply embedded, including from a cultural point of view, in the social structures of our societies.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore need a global approach, a comprehensive approach to combating gender violence in order for it to be effective, because it is a form of violence that is very difficult to eradicate, extremely difficult to eradicate. This is why, despite the progress that has been made in the fight against this type of violence at national level, we are still systematically dealing with this scourge, which is often only the tip of the iceberg, because only a small percentage of the violence that actually occurs is reported, so it continues to exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore need a global, comprehensive approach, using all of the legal tools available to us, raising awareness in the media and ensuring that education systems are taking the problem into account. On Monday, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) adopted this comprehensive, global approach in the fight against gender violence; in other words, ‘zero tolerance’.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the question put by the honourable Member regarding the existence of violence against children and the elderly, I think that we are talking about violence against the vulnerable; the most vulnerable. As in the expression ‘survival of the fittest’ that we have in many of our countries, in my country, it is, of course, manifested in this violence that is linked to the vulnerability of the weaker person, which in turn demonstrates and expresses the cowardice of the person who is violent towards someone who is more vulnerable, whether it be women, children or the elderly. This is the phenomenon that relates to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council and Parliament did invite the Commission to consider the possibility of an initiative for a European year for combating violence against children, young people and women. This is raised in the Daphne III Programme. It is an expression of the need, honourable Member, for this protection to be extended to all vulnerable people, which certainly include children and the elderly, the two groups to which you referred.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Mr Posselt, the strategy for the Danube region is one of the elements on the programme of the Trio of Presidencies of Spain, Belgium and Hungary. As you can imagine, it was at the initiative of Hungary that the strategy was introduced into the programme.</p>
      <p sl="es">The three countries are therefore committed to helping to develop this European Union Strategy for the Danube region and, in this respect, in June last year, the Council urged the Commission to present it before the end of this year. We are waiting for it to be produced by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">What the Commission has done is to initiate a public consultation. A public consultation that is going to last until March of this year, and subsequently, looking at the results of the consultation, the Commission will propose the strategy, which we hope can be formally adopted in December of this year in the form of a communication from the Commission. We have to wait for this communication to be produced.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any case, I do want to say that there has been an important meeting in which progress has been made on the possible content of this strategy, which was held on 25 February in Budapest with the governments of Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, in which important conclusions were adopted, suggesting what the essential elements of this future strategy should be. It is about these countries joining forces, within the European Union and with the coverage of the European Union, using European funds, but in a financially neutral way, to achieve objectives of progress and significant economic, social and tourism-related development.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore – I repeat – awaiting a communication from the Commission on this, once the consultation has concluded. At that point, the Council will adopt a position as soon as it has the communication from the Commission.</p>

The governments that I mentioned a moment ago are interested in developing this strategy, and we need to wait for the Commission to publish its communication.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do want to say that these countries consider that the European Union needs to play a leadership role in this strategy, especially the Commission, by facilitating cooperation in the Danube region.</p>
      <p sl="es">The statement that I referred to previously, made on 25 February, says how the strategy for the Danube region should be used to increase prosperity, security and peace for the people who live in the region, through trans-regional and trans-national cooperation, as well as coordination at that level.</p>
      <p sl="es">It also considers the following to be strategic policy areas to be included in the strategy: infrastructure, innovation, cultural and artistic activities, sustainable economic development, tourism, food safety, the economy, cooperation in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises, research and development, migration, sport, education, employment, health, social affairs, along with other areas that the document covers extensively and ambitiously.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that the strategy for the Danube region is an important document, and therefore I thank you for your question, which has given me an opportunity to mention it. I think it is an ambitious objective, and we are currently waiting – I repeat once again – for this consultation to take place and for the communication from the Commission, but the political will does, of course, exist.

      <p sl="es">Madam President, naturally, I am convinced that the objective to which Mr Rübig referred is going to be included in this strategy for the Danube region, the dimensions of which I have already talked about.</p>
      <p sl="es">The objectives of this strategy are really important, and relate to a large number of issues that affect the daily lives of the people who live in the area. They therefore relate to the economy, cultural dimensions, and protecting the environment and natural resources, which obviously includes water.</p>
      <p sl="es">As has been said, this natural environment is something intrinsically linked to the region, and I am convinced that it is going to be clearly included in this strategy, which must be led by the countries that are promoting it. They are the countries that I listed, which met a few days ago in Budapest to make progress on setting objectives and clarifying the strategy more precisely, as it is not yet sufficiently defined.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore think it is premature – and I am referring to the speech by the second Member who spoke – to talk about the selection criteria for projects or the eligibility of projects, some of which I have mentioned. Others could also be added, for example, the subjects of navigation, energy security, combating climate change, the effects of changes in the financial markets and, in general, all areas which this strategy and its implementation could undoubtedly improve.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that we all need to work together in the European Union, because we are talking about something on a European scale that affects the whole of the European Union and its main policies. I am certain, for example, that cohesion policy is going to be the focus of attention, not only social cohesion but a new aspect included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which is territorial cohesion.

      <p sl="unknown">Question 4 by Konstantinos Poupakis (H-0055/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: The European Social Model and combating poverty</p>
      <p sl="unknown">At times of economic recession and crisis, the unemployed, low wage earners and pensioners on small pensions find it hardest to maintain a decent standard of living. The mobilisation of the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has not had the desired effect, since 80 million of our fellow citizens are living below the poverty threshold. The European Social Model is based not only on good economic performance but also on a high level of social protection.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In view of this, how does the Spanish Presidency intend, as part of a joint policy in cooperation with upcoming Presidencies, to support the lower economic and social strata so as to help them survive and, at the same time, protect groups of our fellow citizens who are at risk from poverty and social exclusion, thereby safeguarding the core of a social Europe?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 5 by Liam Aylward (H-0102/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion</p>
      <p sl="unknown">EUR 17 million has been provided for 2010 – European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. Although this European Year will promote greater awareness of these particular issues, there is a need for an effective joint action in order to make a substantial difference to the millions of people in the European Union who are suffering because of poverty and social exclusion. What action does the Council intend to take which would lead to the adoption of concrete measures during this year? Would the Council explain how this European year, and its associated budget, will be used effectively to attain long-term results?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-428" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, the Presidency shares the Member’s opinions on the objective of providing a high level of social protection – in particular, in relation to groups threatened by poverty and social exclusion – which is one of the cornerstones of the European social model. This is especially true at a time when we are in an economic recession.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unemployment: it is currently believed that there could be more than five million more unemployed than at the start of the economic crisis. This has meant that many homes have seen their incomes fall, and many are exposed to poverty and excessive debt. It is also probable that unemployment will continue to be high, and therefore, that this long-term unemployment will result in social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, the social consequences of the economic crisis are going to be an important item on the European political agenda in the next few months, and of course on the European agenda of the Trio of Presidencies, without any doubt whatsoever.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have an instrument, a tool for this purpose, which is the declaration of 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, which has four specific objectives: recognising people’s right to dignity and to play an active role in society; a commitment from public opinion to social inclusion policies; a more cohesive society; and, of course, a long-term effort at all levels of government to combat poverty and social exclusion. This effort is to be especially aimed at protecting the most vulnerable – a concept that I used when answering a previous question – who are ultimately the ones that suffer most from both poverty and social exclusion. This is the case with children, women and the elderly.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore, of course, going to support the various initiatives that there may be in relation to poverty and social exclusion and to combating them, and I must say that I hope this is going to become a central objective of the whole of the European Union’s growth and job creation strategy. One of the objectives set out in the document presented by the Commission on 3 March is to reduce the number of people at risk of falling into poverty by 20 million.</p>

      <p sl="en">Can the Council outline how it will ensure that the active inclusion recommendation, which is a tool for fighting family poverty and which has been endorsed by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, is integrated into the EU 2020 strategy and implemented so as to ensure progress on poverty reduction?</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I must say once again that this is the first time that there has been the intention to have such an ambitious European strategy for this problem. In other words, a strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion, and especially for actively including the long-term unemployed and the elderly, so we are once again returning to the concept of the most vulnerable in society.</p>
      <p sl="es">To begin with, in response to the economic crisis that we are experiencing, the European Union has implemented a coordinated policy, an immediate, short-term shock treatment involving injecting public money into the financial system. This triggered what economists call the automatic stabilisers, which is the social protection provided for in welfare states. This meant that there was a reaction that had at least a palliative effect for those people who had become unemployed and those for whom it is difficult, at least in the short-term, to find new employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">In other words, there has been a reaction that should be taken into account, because it is an existing, current, immediate, short-term reaction by the European Union. In addition to this, the European Union is considering a strategy for combating the poverty resulting from long-term unemployment, based on training, specialisation, retraining or education – which does not end when a person is young – in order to create the conditions for employability. This is a very important part of the EU 2020 strategy that I mentioned before, and it was included in the conclusions of the meeting of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council that has been mentioned so many times here and took place this week.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is a European strategy, included among the objectives that the Union is going to prioritise, which is those established in the EU 2020 strategy. One of these quantified objectives – and we will see if they are adopted on 25 and 26 March at the European Council, which has to examine the Communication from the Commission – is a 25% reduction in the number of people who are at risk of entering poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">Let us recall that Europe has 80 million people at risk of entering a situation of poverty; reducing this figure by 20 million and, at the same time, increasing the active population are medium-term objectives that are part of the strategy and which will therefore shape a whole series of coordinated European strategies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ultimately, ladies and gentlemen, the key is to coordinate our employment and social policies. The Treaty of Lisbon states this quite clearly: we have to coordinate our employment and social policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is what the European Union, hastened by the crisis, is beginning to do. This is the best way to respond to this situation, obviously using the tools that we have in the European Union, which are elements of the European Union, such as the internal market or the European Structural Funds.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I have only one question. Poverty affects two social groups most particularly: the low-skilled and those living with disabilities.

My question is: does the European Council wish to address how they could help these two social groups and their situation more effectively?</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the first question, on pensioners who own property in Spain, is very similar to another question put to me previously, and the response is very similar to the one I gave previously.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is a question of clarifying the application of internal legislation in a Member State, which is what I must refer to. I cannot speak on behalf of the Council on this issue, which has legal channels within a Member State. If it had occurred in any other Member State, I am sure that it would have been dealt with in exactly the same way: through internal legal channels.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the question on vulnerable people, I absolutely agree that we should place a special emphasis on the two groups to which the honourable Member referred. This is even more the case given that we now have one more tool that we can use: the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, insofar as it refers to the rights of especially vulnerable people, whether they be elderly or disabled, their dignity and their participation in social and cultural life. In any case, it talks about protecting them, protecting their physical dignity and mental integrity against degrading or inhumane treatment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union has developed various instruments for combating this situation, including a detailed study of the situation. I would like to mention an interesting result of Eurobarometer 2007, according to which half of Europeans think that all elderly people, who are the most vulnerable people, are poorly treated, and even abused in terms of the way in which their needs are met. Nearly half of Europeans think that the way society treats these people is negative, precisely because they are vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Member States and the European Union have applied the open coordination method for exchanging experiences between Member States on this issue. On this subject, it should also be said that, in some cases, we are talking about matters that are dealt with in national legislation. They are matters of national competence, and it is therefore the Member States that need to tackle them, on the basis of, among other things, the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union can support these policies, but it cannot completely replace them. It can support them, but I think that this is something that also relates to the social dimension, which has already been mentioned. I am returning once again to this because I think it is important. The social dimension of the strategy for growth and job creation features very heavily in the document presented by the Commission, and will be debated by the Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that this social dimension should have room for the problems that you refer to that did not feature so strongly in the previous strategy. I think that in the future – given that we are experiencing a crisis that has a social impact – we need to take the social impact of the economic crisis very much into account.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 7 by Justas Vincas Paleckis (H-0057/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU-Russia visa regime</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Spanish Presidency of the Council intends to work towards the future abolition of the visa regime for EU and Russian citizens. This may be a long process, and one that will depend a great deal on Russia’s ability to implement successfully the action plan drawn up with this objective in mind.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Were the EU to open up to Russia’s province of Kaliningrad, or vice versa, this would demonstrate that the EU and Russia are moving towards ‘demolishing visa walls’. Both Russia and the EU have an interest in the principle of cooperation on both sides of the border and in an anti isolationist policy regarding the Kaliningrad region. To that end, neighbouring Poland and Lithuania have reached agreement on making it easier for people living in border areas to cross the border, but this has yet to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does Council assess the specific situation of the province of Kaliningrad in terms of the dialogue between the EU and Russia on visa matters? How could this dialogue be used in order to sign local traffic agreements between EU Member States (Lithuania and Poland) and the Russian Federation in order to make border crossing procedures easier for people living in border areas?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Question 8 by Laima Liucija Andrikiene (H-0080/10)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: EU-Russia relations: Spanish Presidency agenda</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Spanish Presidency of the EU has set out an ambitious agenda when it comes to EU-Russia relations – it would like to see the conclusion of negotiations with Russia on the new partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA), an agreement with Russia on a visa-free regime, as well as progress on a free-trade agreement between the EU and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In order to conclude a free-trade agreement with the EU, Russia first needs to become a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Are there tangible prospects that Russia will join the WTO any time soon? Does the Council have a particular strategy on how to compel Russia to join the WTO?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Council see any substantial progress as concerns the negotiations with Russia on the new PCA?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Does the Council consider that the idea of a free-trade regime with Russia is timely considering the disagreements within the EU on the issue? Does the Council consider Russia to be more prepared for a visa-free regime than other partners of the EU, such as Ukraine, Moldova or Georgia?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-440" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, I understand that there are two questions, one of which refers to visas, to the visa requirement for Russian and European citizens, and the other refers to relations between the European Union and Russia following the Stockholm Summit and to Russia joining the World Trade Organisation. These are the two questions as I understand them, Madam President.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the matter of visas, I would like to point out that in 2003, the Council adopted regulations establishing a specific transit document and a facilitated rail transit document. Three years later, the Commission concluded that the entry into force of this system was going smoothly and that both partners were satisfied.</p>
      <p sl="es">From a long-term perspective – we are talking about the Kaliningrad region in relation to the rest of the Russian Federation – the facilitated transit regime, as it is called, would depend on the future implementation of agreements on visa policies between the European Union and the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="es">In a joint declaration following the meeting of the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council on justice and home affairs on 2 December last year, the participants decided to debate possible changes to the European Union’s agreement with Russia on granting visas in order to make travel for European and Russian citizens more accessible, specifically for the residents of the region of Kaliningrad.</p>
      <p sl="es">In turn, according to the same joint declaration, the European Union and Russia hoped to negotiate and conclude local border traffic agreements between Russia and the neighbouring Member States of the European Union that might be interested in doing so. In this context, Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention authorises the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with third countries in order to apply the local border traffic rules.</p>
      <p sl="es">The negotiation of these agreements is, in this case, a matter that is the responsibility of the Member States concerned and of the Russian Federation. The Council, in any case, notes that negotiations are also under way between Lithuania and Russia and between Poland and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the question relating to strategic relations between the European Union and Russia, the Council can inform Parliament that following the summit held with Russia in Stockholm in November, there will be another summit during the six-month Spanish Presidency. It will be held in Russia, between the European Union and Russia, which means that there is fresh impetus for relations between both sides.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is obviously always the possibility of there being complex difficulties in these relations, and there can also be disagreements, but the relationship between the European Union and Russia is a broad and multifaceted one. We have growing economic and trade links, and – we have to admit – a high level of interdependency with regard to energy, common interests in other areas that relate to problems that go beyond even our respective countries, and challenges, including global challenges, which we need to tackle and which we should tackle as jointly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">It will therefore always be beneficial for us to seek opportunities to strengthen our relations with Russia, while always standing firm on our principles and on the values on which the European Union is founded.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to Russia joining the World Trade Organisation, the European Union, supports it, but it is Russia that has to adopt the measures in order to make progress on this.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the new agreement between the European Union and Russia, both parties agree that it would be good to have a broad new agreement. The agreement on partnership and cooperation between the European Union and Russia, which was negotiated in the 1990s, is outdated in many respects. A great deal has happened and a great deal has changed since the 1990s, and we need to move forward towards this new agreement, in which we are ambitious. We have set the bar high and, if possible, we want to cover all the areas of EU-Russia relations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Progress has been made in some areas of these negotiations. Other areas are going more slowly, which is the case for trade and investment. In any event, it is very important to us that there are solid clauses and solid agreements with Russia on trade, investment and energy.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the free trade arrangements, we agree with a free trade agreement being negotiated once Russia has joined the World Trade Organisation, if and when this happens.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the liberalisation of visas, this is an issue of major political importance that affects Russian and European Union citizens very directly. I think that on this matter, we share the intention of visas being facilitated when this is possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">What would be ideal would be the liberalisation of visas, in other words, removing the visa requirement, but, of course, there is still a great deal left to do in this respect. Furthermore, we need to balance the assets that are at stake, which concern security, and, furthermore, this always has to be done on a reciprocal basis.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, each of these countries has a particular situation as far as visa policy is concerned, and we cannot currently predict how much progress is going to be made in those three countries in comparison with the dialogue on visas that we are conducting with Russia.</p>

How intensive is the dialogue on these critical points? We have the feeling that developments in this regard are going backwards rather than forwards.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns energy security. How, specifically, do things stand in the energy negotiations?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-442" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, honourable Member, as you know, one of the Union’s priorities or strategic central objectives is energy security. In the European Union – especially since many European Union countries suffered very directly from the gas crisis between Russia and the Ukraine at the beginning of 2009 – we place an extremely high value on energy security, and we definitely consider it to be one of the European Union’s major objectives, an objective that is naturally linked to the major objective of combating climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">The strategy of the Council and the Presidency of the Council regarding energy and energy security is the need to move towards a greater differentiation in terms of suppliers and sources of energy and its distribution. We therefore need to expand the possibilities, avoiding oligopolies or excessive dependency.</p>
      <p sl="es">Some European countries have a level of energy dependency on Russia that is clearly excessive, and which also relates to the fact that Europe was divided for a long time during the 20th century and to the fact that in some cases, direct interconnections between European countries do not exist.</p>
      <p sl="es">When that crisis occurred, we saw that some countries that were not affected by it could not help the countries that were affected, because the interconnections did not exist. Therefore, energy objectives in Europe are extremely important, in the medium and long term, and we are therefore in favour of diversifying energy sources and of promoting projects such as the Nabucco project or the Nord Stream or South Stream projects, which relate to Russia, and of achieving something that currently does not exist in Europe: a single energy market. In order to achieve these objectives, which are facilitated by the Treaty of Lisbon, which introduces this competence over energy, which did not exist before, it is fundamental and essential to establish a strategic relationship with Russia on energy and other matters.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, we have other instruments in the Treaty of Lisbon that relate to external policy. The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens European foreign policy: there is a President of the European Council and a High Representative, and there is going to be a European External Action Service. In other words, the European Union’s external vision has been strengthened, which will strengthen our negotiations in all areas, including the economy and energy, with other countries. This is therefore the vision that I can give you on relations with Russia.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are negotiating an agreement in which the subject of energy is essential; these negotiations are beginning, and we have the best prospects for them, but obviously, like all agreements, it is something that depends on very complex negotiations that are, in turn, part of a series of negotiations on this cooperation agreement that we want to update – as I said – because a great deal has happened in Europe in the past 15 or 20 years. One of these things is the essential relationship that we need to have with Russia, which is, as everyone knows, one of the countries that has experienced the most changes in recent years.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in reference to Question No 9, which I was to ask on behalf of my fellow Member, Mrs Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, and which is related to the previous question, Russia intends to locate a nuclear power plant near the eastern border of the European Union, in the province of Kaliningrad, and Belarus has similar plans. Bearing in mind the experience of Chernobyl, these plans are causing misgivings over the danger involved. Does the Council intend to take up the question of environmental safety in the next round of talks with Russia? From our point of view, this is rather important.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to go back to Questions Nos 7 and 8, and to relations between the European Union and Russia. Mr López Garrido rightly said that those relations should be based on values, but if this is so, then the Union has particular obligations towards defenders of human rights in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In relation to this, I would like to ask the following question: should the policy of EU Member States, and of the whole EU, not include special rules concerning visas for human rights defenders in Russia? This would be to enable such people to obtain visas relatively easily.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-445" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Diego López Garrido" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">With regard to the intervention on the subject of nuclear security, I must say that the responsibility, which in this area is national, is provided for in the international agreements of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in other words, in the Convention on Nuclear Safety to which Belarus, Russia, Euratom and the majority of the Member States of the European Union are parties.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Council understands that contracting parties that are located close to a proposed nuclear facility should be consulted, as they could be affected by it. Therefore, the agreement that is currently being concluded between Euratom and Russia, in relation to the peaceful application of nuclear energy, will have to contain provisions on the verifiable requirements on nuclear safety and protecting the health and safety of workers. I would also like to remind you that this issue is dealt with periodically in the context of the dialogue between the European Union and Russia on energy.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to assessing the consequences in an international context, the Council observes that Belarus is a party to the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, which contains binding obligations aimed at assessing the environmental consequences and possible environmental risks. In this case, however, the Council says that the responsibility for organising environmental assessment lies largely with the developers of the projects.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Russian Federation is not a contracting party to this Convention. We would like Russia to apply the Espoo Convention voluntary in any case. It has also been doing so for some time in relation to existing nuclear power stations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, with regard to the question put by the honourable Member regarding human rights in relation to Russia, there was a previous debate in which questions were raised in relation to human rights, and I think that the criteria for defending human rights or reporting human rights violations apply wherever they take place. Therefore, no country is exempt from violations being condemned by right – and I would even say out of moral obligation – and we do condemn and should condemn these violations when they take place within the European Union or in one of its countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">Linking this with visa policy is a leap that is currently very difficult to establish or specify. General negotiations are in progress on visas. I think that it is in the context of these general negotiations on visas that someone could suggest another type of specific channel for facilitating visas, but as I said, at the moment, we are in very broad negotiations on visas with Russia, and I think that this is what we need to focus on: on the organisation of visas in general terms.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is because it is what could really have the best impact in terms of the free movement of people, and even, I would say, offer the best opportunity as regards Europeans and Europe as a whole for their values to be lived and shared by other members of the public and in places outside of the European Union.</p>
