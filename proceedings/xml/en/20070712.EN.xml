      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the debate on the report by Michał Tomasz Kamiński, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with a proposal for a recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council on the negotiation mandate for a new enhanced agreement between the European Community and its Member States of the one part and Ukraine of the other part (2007/2015(INI)) (A6-0217/2007).</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the report we are discussing and on which we will be voting today concerns the agreement on enhanced cooperation between the European Union and Ukraine. I do not want to repeat the contents of this report. In my speech, I would like to focus on the broader context within which this report should be considered.</p>
      <p sl="pl">First of all, the report contains a realistic assessment of the situation in Ukraine and, thus, on the one hand, it acknowledges that we should appreciate the huge effort made by the Ukrainian people and the state along the path to full democracy, a market economy and respect for human rights. It should be added that, during the dozen or so years of independence, Ukraine has made a great deal of progress in terms of creating a modern European Society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, Ukraine is a tolerant, free, democratic country. It is, ultimately, a country where the majority of people support integration with the European Union, as all opinion polls reflect. As we have revealed everything in the report, it should also be stressed that Ukraine does face certain problems. We call on the Ukrainian Government to deal with these issues. The problems are related to, amongst others, the free and proper functioning of foreign companies, including European Union companies, in Ukraine. There are cases of criminal activity. The Ukrainian Government has declared that it will try to combat crime and we should applaud this move.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to stress that in the course of our work on the report, colleagues from all groups interested in Ukraine’s troubles showed a great deal of solidarity. I would like to thank, amongst others, Mr Siwiec from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who is with us today. As the vice-president of the European Parliament and responsible for relations with Ukraine, he has helped me a great deal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">From the outset, I wanted this report to be a document which would unite, rather than divide, this House. I wanted it to be a document on which we would try to reach a consensus. Today, it seems worthwhile for the European Parliament, which is an institution that Ukrainians pay attention to, to send a signal which would show the Ukrainian people that the European Parliament does not want to close its doors to Ukrainians, although, at the same time, it does assess Ukrainian membership in realistic terms, namely as something that will not happen in the nearest future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This great nation is a European nation and anyone who has been to Ukraine can easily see how much of Europe's cultural heritage can be found there. It is enough to see Kiev as the cradle of a very important Christian denomination in Eastern Europe in order to realise that Ukrainians, and the Ukrainian state, fully deserve to be described as a European nation and that we, as the European Parliament, as the European Union, should treat this country with friendship and respect.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that, as I have pointed out, the report will be treated by this House as a compromise document, a document reflecting the good will of our institution, the European Parliament, towards the Ukrainian people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, who I am replacing today, I welcome this opportunity to discuss relations between the European Union and the Ukraine based on the very good report by Mr Kamiński.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report is a balanced political document which contains clear messages. As you know, the situation in Ukraine remains difficult. It is crucial that the agreement of 27 May between President Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yanukovych to hold early elections on 30 September is fulfilled. The main players have to stabilise the country’s political situation, and they must establish a viable constitutional system. Only in this way can they create the conditions for the country to move forward with political and economic reforms, based on respect for the principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the market economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to the elections, it is paramount to ensure they are conducted in a democratic manner in accordance with international standards. We have been in regular contact with the various political sides in Ukraine to pass on these messages. We regularly continue to do so. For instance, my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner met Prime Minister Yanukovych at the Cooperation Council on 18 June, and she will meet Foreign Minister Yatsenyuk next week. The EU-Ukraine Summit on 14 September in Kiev, just two weeks before the elections, will be a key event to reaffirm these messages at the highest level.</p>
      <p sl="en">We strongly welcome the fact that the report by Mr Kamiński emphasises these crucial messages. This document, along with the recent visit of a European Parliament delegation to Ukraine, led by Mr Severin, the chairman of the Parliament’s delegation for relations with Ukraine, is a valuable contribution towards ensuring stabilisation of the situation in Ukraine and emphasising the importance of constitutional reform. Close coordination between the European Parliament and the Commission on these steps is particularly welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the new enhanced agreement, the political crisis has not had a detrimental effect on the negotiations for the time being. Both political sides in Ukraine attach high importance to the negotiations, four rounds of which have already taken place. The last round took place only last week, on 2 to 4 July in Kiev, and good progress has been achieved on political, justice-related, freedom and security-related and other sectoral aspects of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Ukrainian side, for whom the European perspective is a key concern, is emphasising its objective of ‘political association and economic integration’ in these negotiations. The Summit on 14 September will be an important occasion to assess the overall status of negotiations and provide political momentum for further progress. As it is pointed out in Mr Kamiński’s report, negotiations on a deep and comprehensive free trade area, which will be a core element of the new enhanced agreement, will start as soon as Ukraine’s WTO accession process is finalised. There are still some outstanding issues to discuss, not only with the European Union, but also with other parties, but with some goodwill on the Ukrainian side, their efforts should come to fruition during the course of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, we very much welcome this report and the key messages it sends to the Ukrainian side. On the main issue you raise, i.e. the EU response to Ukraine’s European aspirations, our position is clear: our aim in the negotiations is to bring Ukraine as close as possible to the European Union in as many areas as possible, while not prejudging any possible future developments in EU-Ukraine relations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group I warmly welcome the Kamiński report. Ukraine, as well as being the EU’s immediate strategic neighbour, is our vital trading partner in energy matters. Right now, it is in the middle of a constitutional crisis in terms of divisions of power between the President and Parliament, and between the Ukrainian-speaking western and central regions, mainly supporting President Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko, and the south and east, which are Russian speaking and mainly support Prime Minister Yanukovych.</p>
      <p sl="de">Resolving this will be a test of the maturity of Ukrainian democracy and a challenge to the enduring legacy of the Orange Revolution and the rule of law, but so far, to Ukraine’s great credit, no violence has erupted. Sadly, the Constitutional Court has failed, as a result of undue politicisation, to resolve the dispute over the presidential powers to dissolve the Rada. The current cross-party agreement for fresh elections to the Rada due for 30 September may clear the air, or at least confirm that all major players are essentially for the continuing unity of the nation and in favour of imminent WTO membership, as well as a much deeper economic relationship with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Kamiński report supports these objectives and goes further by keeping the possibility of EU membership open for the longer term. For now, the EU is rightly building on the 2005 ENP action plan and following on from the recent visa facilitation and readmission agreement aiming to develop with Ukraine a deep free-trade agreement, possibly in the form of an association agreement to replace the outdated PCA post-Soviet model.</p>
      <p sl="de">I now call on the EU to boost ENPI financial assistance to Ukraine, and on Ukraine to redouble its efforts to combat corruption in public life, to strengthen judicial independence, whilst demonstrating at the same time its firm commitment to getting closer to the European Union by working towards approximating its laws with the European Union’s acquis communautaire .</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the report everyone is applauding appeared as a result of reflection on what Ukraine is and what it means to Europe. The European Parliament began to reflect on these matters almost three years ago, well before there was ever any talk of the Orange Revolution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have reached a point where we want to put pen to paper and to draw up a plan. We want to call it an agreement, perhaps an association agreement, which would bring Ukraine closer to the European Union. As the Commissioner said, we should bring Ukraine as close as possible. “As close as possible” – this may even be no distance at all. In other words, it may involve future membership of the European Union. We should not be afraid to mention this. We should not be afraid to state that such a prospect exists. Let us also tell Ukrainians about it. This report, which is the first official European Union document on the subject, contains such a statement.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order for these plans to become reality, Ukraine faces a mammoth task and needs a sense of responsibility and duty towards its own citizens. These reforms will be difficult and painful. We want to help with these reforms. The European Union, Ukraine’s membership of the Union and its European aspirations should become a rallying point rather than a cause of dispute.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ukrainian political parties taking part in the elections need to clearly tell the Ukrainian people that they support European Union membership, and that, instead of arguing, they will work towards this objective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I feel comfortable enough to say these words because the European Union, through the consensus reached at the last summit, has clearly shown that it is open to further enlargement. The European Union has shown that it wants to apply the enlargement procedure in a sensible and considered manner that is beneficial to both the Member States, candidate countries and countries which intend to apply for European Union membership in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I encourage you to adopt this report without additional amendments. I hope that it will send an important signal to Ukraine and to the people of the European Union. I hope that we can view the future of Ukraine not in terms of threats and with fear, but in terms of the great opportunities and challenges that face both Europeans and Ukrainians.</p>

      <p sl="hu">At the end of 2004, it was with great joy and hope that we welcomed the news that Ukraine opted for European values and democracy. Since then, experience has shown that strengthening the rule of law, democracy and the free market is not an easy process, and Ukraine must be very careful to safeguard the results achieved, for these are still fragile.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is precisely for this reason that we strongly approve of what Mr Kamiński’s report has also stated, namely that the European Union does not turn its back on Ukraine in this difficult period, but offers even stronger cooperation. For our part, it is fundamentally in our interest that Ukraine be an independent country oriented towards Europe. It is in our interest for the country to be a solid democracy that rests on the rule of law and for it to have a functioning market economy. It is to this end that we wish to offer assistance by means of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ukraine must see that it too has obligations and tasks to perform, and that this agreement makes sense only if Ukraine is able to master the difficulties and is capable of facing the problems. It is our opinion that the relations between the European Union and Ukraine should not take the form of a partnership, but rather the form of an association agreement. We hope that in subsequent stages such an association agreement will replace this partnership one.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Later it would be important for the Free Trade Area between Ukraine and Europe to be expanded, since economic ties are growing ever larger and closer. We consider it important that in the course of reviewing the neighbourhood policy instrument, the support guaranteed to Ukraine be increased. Thus we deem it essential that after the review period, and even now, the major part of this support be devoted to the construction of civil society, that is, to strengthening the independent media, since there is unfailing need for this in Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ukraine also has work to do in the area of the market economy. The untransparent system of state aids need to be transformed, and greater protection given to intellectual property and foreign investments, for there are a great many problems in this area.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We gladly welcome the agreement on visa facilitation, which we have signed, but we consider this only the first step. We believe that this can truly bring Ukraine and Europe closer together. In this spirit, we support Mr Kamiński’s broad, consensus-based report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the author of the report we are discussing, our brilliant colleague Michał Kamiński, for drawing up this incredibly important document.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today’s report is very significant, as it calls on the Council to present Ukraine with clear European prospects, so that the new enhanced agreement will provide the right framework for integrating Ukraine with the Union and, in the future, open the way for its full membership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As Mr Marek Siwiec from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament already noted, this is, in principle, the first official document of the European Union which mentions full membership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are discussing this report at a moment which is very important for Ukraine. In just over two months, parliamentary elections will take place there. We have to admit that our failure to send a clear signal to Kiev could be used by those who oppose reform and the pro-Western attitude of Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mr Kaminski’s report sends precisely such a signal and is another pro-Ukrainian voice in Parliament. I am sure that the adoption of today’s report will further strengthen the European Union’s relations with Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We sometimes hear sceptical voices in Ukraine, who claim that their country has no choice and can only move eastwards because the West does not want it. I hope that today’s vote will show that these politicians are wrong. Ukraine must be given priority status, if only because of the key role it plays in ensuring the stability and energy security of the European Union. This is particularly important at this time, when we need to support the decision on changing the direction of the Odessa-Brody pipeline and activities to extend it to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to remind you that a significant example of the faith we are placing in Ukraine as a valuable member of the European democratic community is the UEFA decision to allow Poland and Ukraine to co-host the European Football Championships in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that Ukraine forms part of Europe through its historical connections with its neighbours. Since gaining independence, Ukraine has chosen a democratic path for the development of its state. All European countries share this trait. I hope that Parliament will confirm today that the choice Ukraine made was the right one.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report. Before delivering my speech today, which will be highly critical of the political system in Ukraine, let me say this: a glance at the map or a history book provides clear evidence that Ukraine is a European country and that, in actual fact, the question of its membership of the European Union can only be linked to the progress being made with the democratic reforms in Ukraine. The fact that Ukraine is a part of Europe should go without saying for every one of us.</p>
      <p sl="de">After many visits, both before and after the Orange Revolution, I have to say that the political system, or rather the system of political elites in Ukraine, is in an absolutely deplorable state. The party blocs, without exception, have been utterly discredited. The reputation of the core institutions, the reputation of the presidency and that of Parliament have suffered greatly from the fact that, over the last two years, the public interest has effectively become immaterial within those institutions, which have focused their entire attention on the interests of the elite groups that have now commandeered them. This has left a power vacuum in Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are reports, for example, of a second wave of enrichment taking place in the shadows of the altercations in Parliament. That has got to change. After the elections we must employ our best efforts to ensure that the path to genuine democratic compromises between the blocs is pursued, because there will be another stalemate. Action must be taken to thwart the attempt to introduce a sort of tyranny of the majority in Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are nevertheless hopeful signs too. I think it is a very good thing that the people of Ukraine are taking this whole conflict calmly and that they no longer run the risk of being driven to violent action. I hope this remains the case, and I believe the situation will become more stable if we continue to present the Ukrainians with an honest appraisal of their membership prospects. In this respect I am very pleased with the signals regarding an association agreement and with the present report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the outstanding piece of work he has produced. We have in the meantime all agreed in our debate that Ukraine, as one of our neighbours, should be a stable, democratic and developing state. I feel that the report rather lost sight of three points which I would like to focus on. The first point is that we should push for stabilisation in the socio-economic sphere, especially regarding the health situation in Ukraine. I am not sure that we are sufficiently aware of the seriousness of the fact that, due to the weakness of its economy, Ukraine has experienced increased levels of very dangerous diseases, and especially infectious diseases. These diseases also present a threat to other countries, and especially the countries of the European Union, due to high levels of migration. I consider it very important for us to step up our assistance to Ukraine in the area of health in the immediate future.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The second point concerns Ukraine’s neighbours, Moldova and Belarus. The EU has put a lot of political effort as well as financial resources into resolving the situation in the Transnistria region. I feel we should pay more attention to how these financial and human resources are being put to use on the Ukrainian side towards a positive solution to the situation in Transnistria, especially as regards controlling the black market and other problem issues in this border area where Ukraine has great potential for intervening in a positive way.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Concerning Belarus I feel particularly that we should focus on getting Ukraine to cooperate more as regards addressing the impact of the Chernobyl disaster, and also to cooperate more with Belarus on resolving immigration issues, as it is clear that Ukraine has become a major conduit for illegal immigrants coming into the EU. I feel that our common wish should be for the forthcoming elections in Ukraine to be free of external interference, to be truly democratic and to show that Ukraine is a good and stable partner for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would ask of the apparently absent Portuguese Presidency one thing, and one thing only: clarity about the boundaries of the European Union. In my view, Ukraine clearly falls within these. Needless to say, such an open message from Brussels to Kiev requires a helping hand from Europe in the shape of commitment, something which is clearly present in Kiev, as I learnt during a delegation visit in late May. This visit constituted an informative and inspiring European–Ukrainian initiative, on which I should like to congratulate the Commission. Ukraine is equally helped on its way to Europe by the solid report by Mr Kamiński, which I will be happy to support, because it informs the Ukrainian state and administrative institutions quite clearly of the European reform requirements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is a huge responsibility on the part of the current Ukrainian political elite to rid itself of the evil, self-interested stench, both tangible and intangible. This self-cleansing process will give the national cause the indispensable public support it needs to join the European Union. The European institutions must make a concrete contribution to this beckoning European perspective for Ukraine, particularly during this exciting, yet polarising, election time. The Kamiński report sets the right example. It points Ukraine, which, undoubtedly, has a long way to go yet, in the direction of Europe in a very clear and concise manner. Let us make sure that country’s journey is smooth, and also join it on its journey.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse the report by Mr Kamińsky, which describes the situation just as it has been observed recently by myself and other members of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee in meetings with the Ukrainian parliament, the government and President Yushchenko. The report also describes the Union’s hitherto uncertain position regarding Ukraine. Following our support for the Orange Revolution in December 2005 and the welcome given to President Yushchenko in this Parliament, we should have gone further. We should have said clearly that we do not just support Ukraine but we stand shoulder to shoulder with it as well. Despite all of the problems that our eastern neighbour is encountering, I firmly believe that Ukraine can become a member of the European Union in the foreseeable future. Not only does it have strong historical, cultural and economic ties with the Member States, but it also plays a key role in providing energy security for this area.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Just like the rapporteur, I support an agreement between the European Union and Ukraine that sets out specific terms and conditions as well as a timetable for the development of relations and for reforms leading to the integration of Ukraine into the Union. I am also in favour of increasing financial assistance to Ukraine, while continuing our calls for the thorough implementation of reforms, for the tackling of corruption and for the creation of a stable, reliable and predictable investment environment. I hope that the new Member States in particular will take part in this process, as they share with Ukraine not just linguistic and geographical proximity, but also a totalitarian past and a reformist present.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one need only look at the map to realise that Ukraine is one of the most important countries for us in strategic terms. This is why we are bound to have a great interest in ensuring that Ukraine follows a democratic course, based on the rule of law, and enjoys economic success, because these are the best signs that a country is on the right path.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, it also has to be said that Ukraine, as an independent nation, is free to chart its own course and that no one – not even a large neighbour – has any right to exert influence. The age of spheres of influence is past, and every country in Europe can take free decisions. That is why it is important that Ukraine is being offered this enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement, which will significantly increase Ukraine’s scope for free decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="de">I see this agreement in the context of accession to the WTO, of a future free-trade area, of the continuing development of the European neighbourhood policy and of the possibility of an extended European Economic Area, or whatever we called it here in Parliament. It is a matter of paving the way for a free Ukraine that is focused on Europe and is part of the Euro-Atlantic community.</p>
      <p sl="de">How far that way leads will depend on the development of the European Union and on that of Ukraine. We all have our homework to do. But we should not make any false promises, with no one knowing whether we can keep them, for that will lead to disappointment. On the contrary, we must now implement this partnership and cooperation agreement so that the Ukrainian citizens realise, today and tomorrow and in the days to come, that progress is being made and that people benefit from living in freedom and democracy under the rule of law in a country with a Western orientation. And it is here that we must help.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Mrs Harms said, the political elite in Ukraine must also come to appreciate this, and an end must be put to all this tactical manoeuvring that is motivated by sheer personal vanity and achieves nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we have an obligation and must fulfil it and that we should not make any false promises but remain realistic, so that our statements possess credibility.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we too deem it important that the Commission be ambitious when it comes to concluding a new agreement with Ukraine. In this respect, far-reaching and continuing economic integration in particular, combined with the development of cooperation in as many other areas as possible, should, as we see it, be centre stage.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The message which the European Union should send out is that we would like to continue deepening our relations with Ukraine. If we want to do this properly, it is, of course, important that something be done within Ukraine as well because, ultimately, the key to successful cooperation lies with Kiev itself. This also means that we must bring pressure to bear with a view to redressing the political balance in that country. What we should actually work towards or help create is a kind of historic compromise between the east and west. If the political conflict in Ukraine is not resolved, I foresee major problems in the further development of cooperation with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The text of the report is cautious where the longer term is concerned, but does not close the door completely. It is also extremely important that we send this message to Ukraine today, again under the caveat that the key lies with Kiev itself. It depends on that country’s reform capacity whether the request for membership will ever become an actual question. Whilst we should not slam the door today, we should remain realistic. What is important, as I have already mentioned, is for Ukraine to develop its own reform agenda, in which, above all, not only the fight against corruption and the creation of more transparent structures in that country are important, but also the phasing out of oligarchic structures.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I should like to finish off with two comments. I think that Ukraine can play a role as key country in that region. This is something we have to nurture and is also mentioned in Mr Kamiński’s report. If we look at the Black Sea region, which is racked with problems such as energy, trade and the fight against crime, and where cooperation between countries is called for with support from the European Union, then Ukraine can play a major role there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, something else that is also reflected well in the report is that Ukraine plays a key role in Europe’s energy supply where distribution and transit are concerned, but also when it comes to putting its own energy household in order. In fact, the Commission, and the European Union, can also play a major role in this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the mandate we are discussing is, finally, a positive and constructive signal from the European Community which those seeking reform in Ukraine have long been waiting for.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ukraine is a very young country, barely twenty years old. It is only beginning to learn how to function, to build and respect its own structures and institutions, and is learning the rules of democracy. Prior to that, for hundreds of years, Ukrainians were deprived of their own state and this country’s situation is utterly different to that of the Baltic states, which lost their statehood for a period of forty years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The issue of which principles will be used to shape the young Ukrainian state is vitally important as Ukraine is the European Union’s biggest direct neighbour. The question arises as to who will be able to mobilise Ukrainians and to what ends. Will it be Russia, a non-democratic country with a corrupt economy which is used as a tool for exerting political influence, or a democratic and free European Union?</p>
      <p sl="pl">To date, the European Union has, at most, been indifferent to Ukraine’s European aspirations. Apart from its short-term, constructive involvement during the Orange Revolution, the statements of consecutive Commissioners have, so far, revealed the European Union to be indifferent and distant. The mandate we are debating is an opportunity to change this attitude. It creates long-term prospects of European Union membership, pledges more financial aid, following an interim assessment, the creation of a free trade zone and moves to make obtaining visas easier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, everything has its price. In exchange, the Community has made it clear that it expects Ukraine to continue along the path to democracy. Ukraine is expected to focus on building the institutions which are characteristic of a democratic country that is able to independently solve crises. The European Union expects Ukraine to reform and, first and foremost, to grant the judiciary independence from political influence so that the country finally has a fully independent constitutional court. It also wants Ukraine to separate politics from economics and to effectively fight corruption.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is an enormous amount of work, which will be difficult for Ukrainians to complete and will involve many years of toil. However, I am convinced that Ukraine will only be able to meet these challenges if it has a clear, albeit distant, prospect of European integration.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kaminski, for preparing this, to my mind, very important and necessary report. Ukraine has played and will continue to play a very important role, not just in the economic but also in the geopolitical sense. The stability of Europe will depend on how and with whom Ukraine will evolve. It is enough to look at history to convince us of this. If Europe wishes to create real stability and security, it will have to pay due attention to Ukraine. Europe needs Ukraine, and Ukraine, without a doubt, needs Europe. We need to extend a hand to the people of Ukraine, we need to help them get over the fear instilled in them by Soviet and Russian propaganda, we need to do away with the remnants of the Cold War, and Ukraine needs to become a reliable, stable, safe and truly European country. We need more multi-faceted programs and more contacts for this; we need to send very clear signals to the people of Ukraine because there are forces at work scaring the people of Ukraine about Europe, sowing discord and tension. Europe needs to overcome this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, We approve the report on Ukraine. In some places, however, I would have preferred some even plainer language.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ukraine is going through a phase of upheaval, even if the agreement reached by the conflicting parties on fresh elections at the end of September has helped to relax tension. There is no guarantee that a newly elected Verkhovna Rada will be the key to solving the political problems. Will there be more cooperation and mutual trust between the Blue and Orange camps?</p>
      <p sl="de">On the way to urgently needed stability in Ukraine there are political and institutional hurdles that still have to be surmounted. A clear European perspective can create the necessary impetus towards democratisation and modernisation. The fact that Ukraine falls far short of compliance with international human-rights standards must be mentioned, as must the fact that corrupt structures, particularly in politics and the judiciary, along with the impenetrable web of collusion with business are obstructing a successful reform process.</p>
      <p sl="de">The prospect of accession is very important and necessary, both to Ukraine and to the EU. The European ideal of creating a continent in which peace, democracy, prosperity and human rights prevail applies to all European countries, and we are addressing that clear message to Ukraine too.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report. Three years after the Orange Revolution we have the right to be dissatisfied with the progress made in the fields of democracy, free market and the rule of law in Ukraine. However, those who themselves lived through the communist era in the second half of the twentieth century – and here in the European Union there are ten countries which have experience of this – know how difficult it is to free oneself, both psychologically and institutionally, from the oppressive and overpowering system of real socialism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us remember that Ukraine now has a free and diverse media, which is always the most important guarantee of progress. I agree with most of the previous comments. If we all agree on this matter, why do we not dot our ‘i’s? Why do we not write clearly about Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union which, it goes without saying, lies in the distant future?</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we, the European Union, want to promote our system of values, namely democracy, the free market and the rule of law in eastern Europe, especially in Belarus, Russia or in the Caspian Sea basin, we must have a clear position concerning Ukraine. We have to be explicit about its future membership. If we fail to do this, we will lose the opportunity to create long-term, beneficial stability in eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Our proposals concerning Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union do not force Ukraine into anything. The decision will still be up to the Ukrainians. I particularly wanted to stress this point. Neither are these proposals false promises.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we still have two specific tasks ahead of us. First of all, we should ensure, by means of diplomatic efforts, that the elections planned for 30 August do actually take place. Secondly, a significant, rather than a purely symbolic, group of observers should be sent to the elections. This is our duty and it is what all the Ukrainians I have spoken to have requested.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Allow me to begin by welcoming the Council’s decision to start negotiating a new treaty between the EU and Ukraine, aimed at extending political cooperation and achieving the gradual economic integration of Ukraine into the internal market of the EU. I share the rapporteur’s view that the fulfilment of these ambitious goals, which are important to both sides, will require the establishment of specific procedures, conditions and priorities. Among these priorities are entry to the WTO and the gradual creation of an integrated free trade zone, which should be based on a common regulatory basis and which in my view should include all trade in goods, services and capital. The second priority in the economic sphere should be to integrate Ukraine as quickly as possible into the European energy community.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today we are discussing the agreement between the European Union and the largest country in Europe, after Russia. Ukraine is, geographically speaking, the biggest country in Europe, and for thousands of years it has participated in and helped to shape European culture. For years it has been expressing its very clear aspirations to join the European Union, as it believes that the provisions of our Treaties, which state that any European country has the right to join the European Union, are more than just empty words.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Ukraine is also very important to Europe. This point has been mentioned on a number of occasions in this House and also features in the draft report. If only because of energy issues, Ukraine should already form part of the European energy security system and actions such as the construction of the Odessa-Brody pipeline, Ukraine's involvement in the Nabokov pipeline project or incentives for action within the framework of GUAM are perfectly appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It has been mentioned here that Ukrainian political institutions are not mature enough for European Union membership. This may be true today, but I do not think that Ukraine's institutions and Ukrainian democracy are in a worse state than the situation we are dealing with in Turkey. We should also remember that, if we do not count the Baltic states, Ukraine is the most democratic of all the countries which emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That is why we should give Ukraine the green light.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Mr President. First of all I would like to express my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Kamiński. The rapporteur’s deep personal interest in the development of events in Ukraine and in fostering relations between the European Union and Ukraine has certainly been beneficial for the formulation of Parliament’s position. Ukraine has always attracted the special attention of the European Union. It has an important geopolitical role, which stretches far beyond its borders. The European Union has a vital interest in a democratic and economically flourishing Ukraine. Setting out a perspective for Ukraine’s proposed goal of becoming a European Union Member State would be a significant contribution towards attaining these goals. This would constitute highly significant support for the development of democratic processes in Ukraine, would help internal political processes within the country to acquire stability, and would foster the process of uniting Ukraine’s society. The directions set out in the report, for reform in the country and tasks for improving democracy, the rule of law, entrepreneurial activity and investment to improve the environment, are important elements of support for Ukraine’s long-term stabilisation. Ever closer cooperation with the European Union will point the way for resolving these issues and will establish the pace of Ukraine’s progress towards integration with the European Union. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we Members of the European Parliament have emphasised on numerous occasions in plenary and in our committees how important our Ukrainian neighbour is to us. We followed the encouraging developments that resulted from the Orange Revolution with great sympathy and tried to nurture them wherever we could. We are continuing this effort today by approving the construction of an enhanced partnership between Ukraine and the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ukraine is undergoing what is potentially a highly promising transformation process. It is still far short, however, of the stage reached by our newer Member States in the EU. Ukraine itself can influence the pace of the process. We are prepared to assist it in its efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">I see the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the subsequent formation of a government in part as a litmus test of the country’s future orientation. If a European perspective is to be adopted, a political culture compatible with European standards must be developed. The elements that have rigged elections in the past and indulge today in shopping sprees in Parliament to buy missing votes must change their behaviour radically. The same applies, of course, to those who allow themselves to be bought.</p>
      <p sl="de">All political forces are called upon to respect and protect the country’s institutions, their assigned powers and their integrity and not to use them as pawns and bargaining counters in the domestic political struggle. Only if that goal can be consistently achieved will people gain confidence in democracy as a form of government that is worth supporting.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Harms has already referred to the institutions, and I too am deeply concerned about the way in which the Ukrainian institutions are treated. I believe we in the European Union cannot begin to imagine the scale these practices have attained. That is why our report is peppered with detailed demands that we expect Ukraine to meet on its way to Europe. These expectations must be fulfilled.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Ukraine is a rich country, a huge market, a dynamic society formed by a large number of citizens, an impressive source of natural richness and a major transit route for energy and basic goods. It is a great European culture and a large territory with a crucial geo-strategic position.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must decide if we want Ukraine to be a mere buffer zone behind a parochial European Union hiding its structural weaknesses, or an advanced post of a strong, proud, democratic, political union at the contact-point – rather than at the demarcation line – between Europe and Eurasia, between Europe and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most Ukrainians, irrespective of their political and ideological affiliation understand that only within relations with the European Union can their individual, social, national and international security be consolidated. We must tell them in response to their legitimate aspirations and in accordance with our fundamental interests that we are ready to share all our resources and policies with them once the legal, political, legislative, institutional and moral interoperability between Ukraine and the European Union are in place. We must also tell them that we are ready to consider the possibility of eventually even sharing our institutions with them under the appropriate circumstances and at the right time.</p>
      <p sl="en">For these goals and expectations to be realistic, the European Union must bring its institutional reforms to a successful conclusion. At the same time, Ukraine must dramatically improve its democratic structures firstly with its check-and-balance mechanisms, separate policy from business, thus freeing public policies from oligarchic control, and bridge the cultural divides between its eastern and western territories.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union must establish a clear relationship between the internal progress of Ukraine and its progress in acceding to the opportunities presented by the European Union. The document proposed to us is based on these ideas, therefore it is important to adopt it, thus passing on the right messages to all those concerned.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I warmly welcome the progress made by Ukraine over the past few years to get closer to Europe and to our fundamental values. However, we should not disregard the serious problems that the country is facing: corruption is rampant, mutual distrust is strong and the judicial system is dysfunctional and totally discredited. In this context, we must encourage reforms, but Ukraine should also ensure that its declarations are followed by practical actions and that deeds follow words.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proof of this is Ukraine’s attitude towards Romania and Bulgaria with regard to visa policy. Last month, the EU signed two agreements on visa facilitation and readmission with Ukraine. However, I recently learned that our privileged partner refuses to extend visa facilitation to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens. This is totally unacceptable. Ukraine’s authorities may have forgotten that Romania and Bulgaria are now full members of the European Union and, as such, their citizens are entitled to equal treatment. This is a basic principle that Ukraine should take on board as soon as possible if it wants to be taken as a serious partner.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to commit to their undertaking not to ratify this agreement before Ukraine has lifted the visa obligation for the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria. Ukraine must understand that this should be resolved as a matter of urgency or it might wholly jeopardise its credibility. I hope we can expect positive developments for the next September summit.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, to a large extent, today’s debate deals with the future of Europe, namely whether it will be based on Christian traditions or whether it will lose its past and its future.</p>

I am surprised that the Middle East is more important to some Members. You can imagine Europe in Asia but fail to see a large part of our continent. Today, Ukraine is in the throes of political and economic crisis.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union has certain responsibilities towards Ukraine. Two years ago, we played a significant part in supporting the Orange Revolution in Kiev. Back then, the aim was to bring democracy back to this country. Now, the aim is to consolidate it. In order for this to happen, Ukraine should have clear prospects for the future. We cannot say, as the Commissioner stated, that Ukraine should be as close to the European Union as possible. No. We need to be explicit. Ukraine needs, and I would like to stress this fact, the prospect of European Union membership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the meantime, we should support economic progress in Ukraine by signing an association agreement, an agreement on a free trade zone and support Ukraine’s membership of the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should also be clear on another matter. The Union has its own agenda regarding Ukraine and we are fully entitled to expect Ukrainians to introduce European economic standards, to separate politics and the economy, to solve the current political crisis by democratic means and make sure that the upcoming elections are held lege artis .</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are also entitled to expect the current Ukrainian Parliament's inter-party team, which is dealing with adapting Ukrainian law to European Union standards, to be reactivated during the next Parliamentary term and to be a significant partner for us in the future.</p>

I am certain that Ukraine will not falter on the path to Europe. However, such floundering about as conflicts and tensions, which occurred this spring, do not advance Ukraine toward its destination. I would support the proposed EU-Black Sea Dimension initiative, the core axis of which would be Ukraine and Turkey attracting Russia and some other countries. The accrued experience of the Baltic Sea countries' cooperation and the Northern Dimension would be very helpful in this. There has been much discussion for a long while about changing the direction of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline and bringing it closer to the EU, but now it is time to actually do the work. I support the suggested amendment, which underlines the fact that the success of Ukraine's integration into EU institutions will depend on reforms not only in Ukraine, but in the EU itself. Whether they intended it or not, the machinations of Poland, the United Kingdom and some other countries concerning a reform agreement with Ukraine have acted against Ukraine's interests in its goal of an unwavering approach to the EU.</p>

Odată cu aderarea României la Uniunea Europeană, frontiera comună cu Ucraina s-a extins, ambele părţi devenind tot mai conştiente de avantajele şi oportunităţile unor relaţii aprofundate şi consolidate. Îi mulţumesc, în acest sens, domnului raportor pentru examinarea tuturor elementelor cheie în această direcţie.</p>

      <p sl="en">Pe plan intern, stabilitatea politică şi consolidarea principiilor democratice constituie o prioritate. Printre ele, respectarea drepturilor omului şi libertăţilor fundamentale, mai ales a minorităţilor şi a drepturilor acestora de a-şi vorbi limba şi de a-şi promova cultura, trebuie să stea la baza eforturilor Ucrainei de a deveni o societate multiculturală democratică, partener credibil al Uniunii Europene. Pentru a nu vorbi la modul general, doresc să atrag atenţia asupra încălcării drepturilor minorităţii române din Ucraina. Dreptul la educaţie în ţară şi în străinătate, dreptul la cultură şi religie sunt grav încălcate de către statul ucrainean care, în acelaşi timp, depune eforturi susţinute de divizare a acestei minorităţi în minoritatea română şi moldovenească, fără nicio raţiune istorică sau ştiinţifică.</p>

      <p sl="et">As the leader of the Moldova delegation, I would like to emphasise Ukraine’s role as the preserver of stability in the European Union. The frozen conflict in Trans-Dnistria is a relic of the Cold War in Europe. The separatist regime is kept in power by revenues from smuggling, as well as by Russian forces.</p>
      <p sl="et">Ukraine’s readiness to cooperate with the European Union’s border assistance mission has helped bring us closer to securing the departure of illegal governments, by reducing the Trans-Dnistrian regime’s budget revenues by one third.</p>

Although the situation is far from ideal, Ukraine has nonetheless made advances in respecting human rights and in extending the rule of law. The conflict between the President and the Prime Minister will be resolved in Kiev within a democratic framework, as befits a country aspiring to join Europe.</p>
      <p sl="et">In order to become a serious candidate for membership of the European Union, Ukraine must strengthen its civil society, safeguard the freedom of the media, increase the independence of the judiciary and make democratic monitoring the norm.</p>

      <p sl="sv">A lot has happened since the Orange Revolution, in both Ukraine and the EU. The report that we are debating today describes what has happened in Ukraine and the problems and challenges that the country faces and that it has been presented with, as well as the work that still has to be done and the reforms that still have to be implemented. As with most of our debates on the EU’s relations with various countries, we are describing the situation in Ukraine and making demands and issuing exhortations.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Too rarely do we reflect, however, on the fact that the EU has changed over time. In the less than three years that I have been a Member of the European Parliament, Europe has already become less open, cooperative and generous and more chilly and introverted. We think too often about what things cost and too rarely about what they mean for ourselves and for the Europe of our children. That applies in particular when we begin to talk about a country’s prospects in relation to the EU or the possibility of future membership. I am therefore pleased that this report supports Ukraine’s desire and ambitions to draw closer to the EU and one day also to be reunited with the rest of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I consciously use the word ‘reunification’ instead of ‘enlargement’ because Ukraine, just like the rest of Eastern Europe, is, and always has been, a part of Europe. It is just that, for several decades, these countries had been kidnapped by Communism. It is time that we now corrected this mistake, and in the case of Ukraine the best way of doing that is to support this report, support the further development of relations between Ukraine and the EU and give Ukraine clear prospects in relation to the EU – prospects that obviously should not exclude membership once all the conditions for membership have been complied with.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the prerequisite for political success is, first and foremost, having clear aims and working consistently to fulfil them. Consistency is particularly important in the case of the complicated political system of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of Ukraine, a region of great political, economic and strategic significance, the European Union has to show steely determination in terms of implementing its existing aims. The European Union assisted Ukraine at a key moment in its history, during the Orange Revolution, when decisions were made concerning the path that that country would follow, namely towards the East or the West, towards the European Union or Russia. We made the right decision and consistent implementation is now necessary.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The situation is considerably less dramatic now. However, the European Union needs to take decisive action aimed at integrating Ukraine into the Union’s structures. Acting on the principles of partnership and solidarity, the European Union should support the young Ukrainian democracy and protect it from internal threats. Further integration into the structures of the European Union requires Ukraine to make more of an effort, including in fields such as fighting corruption and modernising the Ukrainian legal system and infrastructure. Without our help, Ukraine will not be able to achieve European Union standards in the fields of democracy and the free market, and will not succeed creating a state based on the rule of law or separating politics from economics.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It saddens me to see that Ukraine is not a priority for the Portuguese presidency. Ukraine is mentioned in the document we have received, but it is a shame that, unlike Brazil, there is no separate chapter dedicated to it. Ukraine is the largest European country which remains outside the European Union. We need to provide it with long-term prospects of European Union membership, as we have done with Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to say something more about European hypocrisy. Supporters of the constitutional treaty criticised the Treaty of Nice. One of their main criticisms was that it could not provide the basis for enlarging the European Union. Let them, then, be consistent and stress in the same way that reforming the treaty will allow us to make a historic decision regarding Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I warmly welcome the political angle of the report. It shows that Ukraine is not a threat but an opportunity for the EU. I know that Europe will not be whole until Ukraine becomes part of the European Union. We are united by a common history and hundreds of thousands of family ties. I am truly delighted that Ukraine is taking the path of democracy. I hope that the start of the accession process will not be hurried, as was the case with Turkey, when not all of the Copenhagen criteria were fulfilled, leading to the current disenchantment on both sides. I hope that also the opposition in Ukraine will declare clearly that EU membership is an important goal for the inhabitants of the eastern part of the country as well. This long-term goal requires a change in thinking on the part of millions of citizens, who must also agree with this goal. It would be easy to promise membership to Ukraine today, but the main thing is first to assist it in joining NATO and the WTO.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to make two comments, the first on the future of Ukraine and the second on financial assistance from the European Union. The wording used in the Kamiński report about the European Union perspective is clear and well balanced. There are many important steps ahead that we cannot ignore.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are in an intensive phase of negotiations on the new enhanced agreement. Ukraine is in the final phase of WTO accession negotiations, which would also open the way for free trade area negotiations. We are talking about visa facilitation, where equal treatment with regard to the requirements of all EU citizens should be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know from my own experience that, while democratic reforms are more than necessary in Ukraine, it is far from an easy way ahead, so we have to work hard, we have to work together and we have to work with an open mind and open hearts. I also know from my own experience that clear messages of support and readiness to help on the difficult way ahead are of utmost importance for success. The report we are discussing today is sending exactly those signals and important messages about the future of Ukraine.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point concerns financial assistance to Ukraine. As you know, Ukraine is entering a new phase, the new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), and almost EUR 500 million over the four-year period 2007-2010 will be granted to help Ukraine. If you compare the Tacis help from a few years ago, in 2002, to the figure now, in 2007, you will see that it has trebled over that five-year period.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is not only a question of technical assistance. Now we are upgrading that help and focusing on strengthening good governance, democratic development, regulatory and legal approximation, infrastructure, development, in particular in the field of energy, and modern management, including readmission-related issues. In addition, the extension of the EIB mandate to include Ukraine means that it will have also access to substantial funds in that area. We in the EU will certainly give financial assistance to help Ukraine access these funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank you, the Members of the European Parliament, for your comments, which show your keen interest in one of our key neighbours. Mr Kamiński’s report and today’s debate are truly valuable contributions to the EU’s ongoing development of relations with the country. It is important that we work together to encourage Ukraine to continue firmly on the path of reform for their benefit and for their future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate you on having taken up this honourable office.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union consists not only of 27 countries, but also of 268 regions, which have extremely different levels of development. As a result of the most recent enlargement to create a Union of 27 countries, the population of the Community rose to nearly 493 million. Around 30% of these people live in 100 of the poorest regions, namely those covered by the convergence objectives.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Each consecutive enlargement has resulted in greater inequality between the richest and the poorest regions in the Community. Now, in a Union of 27 countries, differences in the levels of GDP between the regions are significantly more pronounced than they were in the old fifteen, and amount to 24% in north-eastern Romania to 303% in central London.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The reasons for the economic under-development of specific regions vary greatly. The poorest regions mainly lack the basic infrastructure necessary for sustainable, long-term development, further investment and the necessary human resources. As statistics show, the existing European Union cohesion policy has effectively contributed to the development of many regions of countries which have long been included within its framework, such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In accordance with the aims of the Community, as stated in Article 158 of the Treaty on European Union, which include harmonised development and the reduction of disparities between levels of development in different regions, we the European Parliament call for decisive action aimed at reducing the most serious cases of under-development in the poorest regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The new Member States have been particularly affected by the difficulties related to absorbing EU funds, as the fact that they have been granted does not guarantee that they will be used properly, and the authorities in poor regions often do not have the ability, experience or resources required to fully benefit from the funds to which they are entitled.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The application procedures for structural fund aid are often extremely complicated and in no way transparent for the end user. We therefore call for these procedures to be simplified at all levels, namely at European, national and regional level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The implementation of cohesion policy should take into account the varied needs of the regions, especially urban and rural areas, regions that are difficult to access, islands and ultraperipheral regions. It should adapt the aid provided to their conditions and specific characteristics, exploiting their potential for sustainable and long-term growth.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Member States and the regions should therefore ensure that priority is granted to those projects that contribute to improving accessibility to the poorest regions, ensuring that they have a proper transport and information technology infrastructure. Cohesion policy should support entrepreneurship and investment in the poorest regions. New financial instruments, such as JEREMY and JESSICA, can successfully contribute to regional development, but awareness of how to use these instruments at a local and regional level is still very limited.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is important to encourage Member States to form public-private partnerships and exchange good practice concepts in this field. The Commission and the Member States should effectively support projects that increase the regions' abilities to generate and absorb new technologies, while paying particular attention to protecting the natural environment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An incredibly important problem for the poorest regions of the Union has been high levels of unemployment, up to 20%. In view of this, there is an urgent need to invest in human capital in poor regions through better education, constantly improving qualifications, especially for young people, women, and older people, as well as minorities at risk of social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Support for equal opportunities for all should form part of all Community programmes, especially those which influence economic and social cohesion, as well as at all levels of planning and implementing projects within the framework of the European Union's cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Commission and the Member States should ensure that accurate, comprehensive and comparable statistical data is available. This is something that we are currently lacking. The Commission should draw up a new method of measuring regional development, not only on the basis of GDP and unemployment rates, but also on the basis of other qualitative and quantitative indicators which reflect the real living standards of the population. We should also improve our methods of calculating purchasing power parity by developing regional rather than national indicators.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Taking advantage of the interim review of the Community budget in 2009, the Commission should analyse the effects of cohesion policy and investigate possible causes of undesirable results.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this report. I would like to thank you for your valuable amendments, which have enriched the document, and I sincerely hope that this own initiative report will provide the Member States and the regions with a host of valuable guidelines, as well as stimulating the European Commission to improve the effectiveness of cohesion policy in the most needy regions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is a pleasure to come before Parliament to exchange views on the Geringer de Oedenberg report on the role and effectiveness of cohesion policy in reducing disparities in the poorest regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, as in the case of other own-initiative reports adopted by the Committee on Regional Development, this proves the excellent collaboration between our two institutions. I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Hübner, who has had to go to Romania, and she sends you her best wishes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome this report and I appreciate its positive contribution to the debate on the impact and effectiveness of cohesion policy at a critical moment of the 2007-2013 programming period and on the eve of the budgetary review to be carried out in the year 2008/09. I fully share the view that the cohesion policy is not only essential but also effective in reducing socioeconomic and territorial disparities and in tapping the development potential of all EU regions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The value added of cohesion policy has already been proved, and we all recognise that it goes well beyond financial transfers to include, among other things, the development of partnerships, exchanges of best practice, budgetary stability and a strategic approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly appreciate the theme and the content of your report because it touches on the backbone of cohesion policy. Indeed, the main goal of our policy is to reduce the socioeconomic and territorial disparities in the poorest EU regions. The challenge is not negligible. These disparities have dramatically increased following the recent enlargements, and cohesion policy is the only Community instrument specially designed to this aim. For instance, disparities in GDP per head between the top and bottom 10% EU regions have almost doubled after the two most recent enlargements.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, regional disparities in the EU are very important, much more than within the United States or Japan, or of a similar dimension to that in China and India for instance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite impressive growth rates in the new Member States and the convergence of many regions of the EU-15, there are still 70 regions – home to 123 million Europeans – with a GDP per head below 75% of the EU average. In addition, there are a number of regions – the majority of which are among the most developed ones – which are losing ground. In 27 regions, GDP per head declined in real terms between the years 2000 and 2004 and, in another 24, growth was under 0.5% per year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, as explained in full in the recently published Fourth Cohesion Report, convergence is taking place. This is due both to the accelerated growth of most of the new Member States and to the sometimes sluggish performance of some of the most advanced ones. On the whole, the periphery of the EU is catching up with the core of Europe not only in terms of GDP per head but also of employment, productivity and other indicators, and this is good news. This includes the former cohesion countries which, with the exception of Portugal, in the last few years have experienced impressive progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">This phenomenon – the long-term convergence process – is especially occurring at EU level between Member States and regions. We know that, at national level, the picture is somehow different, since in many cases growth is increasingly concentrated in the capital region or in the main metropolitan areas, which deepens the internal disparities and causes problems related to agglomeration, like transport congestion, pollution, housing price rises and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me underline the substantial contribution of our policy to this overall positive convergence process. Independent evaluation studies have shown that cohesion policy has supported much-needed investment in infrastructure, human resources, modernisation and diversification of regional economies. Between 2000 and 2005, public investment in the four cohesion countries has been around 25% higher than it would have been without cohesion policy. It has contributed to the growth of GDP. Increasing GDP levels attributable to regional policy ranged from 10% in Greece and 8.5% in Portugal in the period 1989-1999, and 6% for Greece and Portugal, 4% in the German Länder and 2.4% in Spain in the period 2000-2006. Preliminary estimates for 2007-2013 suggest an impact of between 5% and 9% in the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has also contributed to reduced social exclusion and poverty. Cohesion policy cofinances the training of nine million people annually. More than half of them are women, leading to better employment conditions and higher income. For example, over 450 000 gross jobs were generated in six countries: Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. Between 2000 and 2005 it accounted for two thirds of Objective 2 funding. It has helped shift the policy mix of public investment in Member States towards growth-enhancing investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the most recent data, the amount of cohesion investment earmarked for research and development, innovation and information and communication technologies (ICTs) for 2007-2013 has more than doubled in comparison with the years 2000-2006. Clearly, it remains to be seen how these plans will be implemented, but we already see, among both the Member States and the regions, an increasing awareness in their development strategies for the next financial period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Certainly, one of the keys of this success lies in the fact that cohesion policy is an integrated, fully-fledged policy; it is not a sectoral policy, or a disjointed bundle of sectoral policies, but an integrated instrument aimed at delivering specific tailor-made solutions for each European region or territory. At the same time, it is not just an EU policy that operates in isolation but it certainly depends on the active involvement of partners at national, regional and local level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your report correctly points to a number of issues which are particularly relevant for the poorest regions if they are to make the best use of the allocated funds. I shall mention just a few likely to provide them with appropriate technical assistance. The importance of designing tailor-made development strategies, or the value of implementing effective partnership and encouraging good practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">I took note of your proposals. I am convinced that some of them will find their way into the current legislative framework that has given rise to the new initiatives recently adopted by the Commission, like the three ‘J’s – Jasper, Jeremy and Jessica – or Regions for economic change. The flexibility of cohesion policy makes it possible to implement the best measures adopted for each case. In this regard, Mrs Hübner will ensure that the Commission pays particular attention to the needs of the poorest regions in the ongoing negotiations on the programming documents for the years 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also appreciate the contribution of your report to the debate on future cohesion policy, which was launched by the publication of the fourth cohesion report. I welcome these valuable recommendations aiming at increasing the efficiency of cohesion policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, we are now at the initial stage of reflection on the future of cohesion policy. This debate aims at nurturing the review of the EU budget that the Commission has to undertake in the years 2008 and 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, you are aware that the public consultation on the future of cohesion policy will be launched following the cohesion forum to be held at the end of September. A dedicated internet site will collect the contributions of Member States, regions, cities, EU institutions, economic and social partners and, of course, civil society organisations. The Commission intends to present the results of this consultation in spring 2008, together with the fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion. On the basis of this and other own-initiative reports recently approved, I am very much looking forward to Parliament’s contribution to this debate.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Mr Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, the differences between the poor and the rich regions of the Community are truly enormous. These regional differences are more apparent in today’s enlarged European Union than they were in the original fifteen. There may be various reasons for this, such as geographical location, the type of residential infrastructure, the sector-by-sector structure of the economy, the stratification of society or other reasons relating to the history of a given area. These differences can be smoothed out to some extent through structural policies, but we will always have richer and poorer regions. In my view it is therefore very important to aim chiefly for a situation where all of the regions in the European Union have more or less achieved definite economic progress and social development. We should target structural funds at clearly boosting GDP growth, increasing employment and contributing to sustainable development. In this regard, I would ask the following questions. What were the structural measures that contributed to the growth of successful regions such as Ireland? What causes regions such as Mezzogiorno in Italy, where decades of structural funding have failed to bring about any major change, to continue to lag behind? How can we make sure that European funds are not squandered in the present but invested for the future?</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, I am not entirely sure that the report we are discussing today provides us with clear guidelines in this issue. The fact of the matter is, however, that only by providing answers to the above questions can we prevent a repetition of the errors of the past in today’s poorest regions, thereby ensuring that European funding will bring real added value to regional economies and societies. It is, however, too soon to make a full assessment of the benefits that structural policies have brought to the poorest regions, because the poorest countries have only just joined the Union. There is still a problem with the complexity of the overall structure.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, allow me also to congratulate you once again on your election yesterday and on your first session in the chair here in the Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for this engrossing report, because at the end of the day we all have the one aim, namely to eliminate the disparities between the regions of the European Union. That is not only in the interests of the poorest regions of the European Union but in the interests of all regions, because the development of the Union as a whole would otherwise stagnate. The fact is that we have huge potential in the regions we are supporting. People there want to get involved and to play their part in the European Union, but we must also give them the opportunity to do so.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to focus on a few points which the rapporteur mentioned in her report and which seem quite important to me. The European Union needs to provide rapid assistance, which means that we must build up the administration and must not tread on each other’s toes in the various tiers of government. This also requires a functioning system of cross-border cooperation. I am eager to see how the Member States actually achieve that aim in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would be delighted if the new financial instruments, Jessica, Jeremy and Jasper, which were invented some years ago, finally became familiar in the Member States and were used to good effect. Of more than 400 applications submitted so far for operational programmes, however, a quarter at most have been approved. I would be pleased if that went more quickly; perhaps it could incorporate scope for subsequent adjustment.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one thing I would like to stress: getting rid of disparities between regions also means working to eliminate differences in the opportunities available to men and women. I therefore urge the House to support the relevant motions here in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, like my fellow Member, Mrs Krehl, I congratulate you on your election and on your first sitting as President.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner Potočnik, I should like to say to you that this report, which has been presented exceedingly well by our fellow Member, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, is first and foremost a cry from the heart. Next, it is a necessity for the European Union, as Mrs Krehl just said, and it is an appeal to the Commission. It is a cry from the heart because the development of poor regions is not just about the development of regions but about the taking account of the situations – tragic situations in some cases – of people who are unemployed or who have to move, etc. It is therefore a human cry from the heart. It is also a necessity – the report explains this well – where the development of the European Union is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That being said, Commissioner, we need to go further, and please do not regard my remark as a criticism, but as an observation; you yourself made various observations, in six minutes or so, culminating in these words: ‘I await proposals from Parliament’. Well, in the report by our fellow Member, there are a number of proposals. What I would like to convey in these few seconds granted to me is that we need clarification from the Commission, today, on the following: who does what, when and how?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who? What is the European Union’s role? I believe that, until now, we have for the most part successfully laid down the conditions in terms of funding, regulations and so on. The report by our fellow Member contains some additional initiatives relating in particular to financial aspects, to technical assistance aspects, etc., with the aim of strengthening the pivotal role played by the Commission and of putting it in a stronger position to make proposals and to provide assistance. But then, nothing, or almost nothing, is said about the role played by the Member States. The fact is, if we want to help regions in difficulty, it is not enough to say ‘there are European funds’, it also requires the Member States to assume their responsibilities. At this level, the Commission cannot impose things, given the constraints of the subsidiarity principle. However, in the light of what has taken place in Ireland and in the south of Italy, etc., some observations and suggestions can be made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must say that, yesterday, I myself actually hosted some mayors of very small local councils of disadvantaged regions, and it is down to them to build projects – they just need to be told how to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, Commissioner, what I personally expect, in addition to what is given in the report by our fellow Member, is that the Commission does as it should do and clearly indicates to us who does what, and how.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I, too, congratulate you on your new office, Madam President.</p>
      <p sl="de">One reform leads to another. That was the reason why we in the Committee on Regional Development, immediately after the reform of the Structural Fund and for the umpteenth time, asked the question how we were to assess Europe’s poorest regions in future. The aim was to give the cohesion policy a future in the light of present-day experience with regard to the new reform of the Structural Funds in 2014, for we know that the willingness of the wealthy Member States to pay into the Solidarity Pact is waning. At the same time, our common commitment to the poorest regions through the cohesion policy is the very thing that keeps the heart of the European Union beating.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, this report hardly deals with these issues concerning the future. It concentrates on the implementation problems in the new Member States in connection with the current Structural Funds Regulation. It illustrates what happens when a solid decentralised administrative structure is considered expendable. I regard it as naive, however, to believe that banks are a substitute for a greater degree of involvement as a panacea for the absorption and administration problems in the very poorest regions.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Jasper and Jessica initiatives must be used in such a way that democratic action is not abandoned and that the public purse is not saddled with debts for generations to come. This would mean the European Union keeping the poorest regions permanently on life support, and that cannot be our intention.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would firstly like to commend the rapporteur for her own-initiative report, which underlines some aspects that we consider important, although we disagree with others, namely with regard to the debate on the future of the cohesion policy and the fourth report on the economic and social cohesion of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is necessary here to stress that disparities, in particular regional ones, have increased dramatically with the successive rounds of EU enlargement, that the increase in regional disparities and the growth in the effects of polarisation at an internal level in each country has been proven, and that, in general terms, there is still a rich centre and a poor periphery, which has now been further expanded.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By stressing these aspects we seek to make a clear case for the existence of a strong regional policy as an essential tool for the reduction of disparities and the promotion of real, as opposed to nominal, convergence in the poorest regions of the European Union. A strong regional cohesion policy is all the more necessary with the heightened costs of the internal market, the policy of liberalisation of markets and competition, and European and Monetary Union, as well as of the euro and its Stability Pact for the poorest regions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is essential that the regional cohesion policy is strengthened, with the much-vaunted social and economic cohesion and real convergence set as a central objective and policy of the European Union, reinforcing the redistributive role of the community budget and providing adequate funding so that the objectives proposed may effectively be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If regional cohesion policy is to be effective then acts that detract from its value, such as the diversion of its funds to finance other policies and priorities which in no way contribute to achieving the objectives previously expressed, must be rejected.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, can you imagine a family setting the table at home for lunch, with lobster for the father, salmon for the mother, meat for one child, beans for another child, greens for another child and nothing for the other child? It simply cannot be and yet that is what is happening in the big European family, which we want to unite under one Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="el">There are 80 million citizens in Europe living below the poverty line. There are pensioners in Greece living on EUR 300 a month and they feel just fine, because in neighbouring countries other pensioners are living on EUR 80.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is the policy of Europe. Certain inaccessible areas in Greece, such as Ipiros, or certain other isolated islands near Turkey have suddenly become rich, precisely because the new incoming countries have brought down the average. This is not logical. We must find a way of developing the economy equally for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="el">When there is a racist attitude on the part of the ministers who create the economy, such as the Minister of Finance, Mr Alogoskoufis, who the other day said that blacks are not people, repulsively and insultingly referring to them as ‘niggers’; when they have this sort of racist attitude, they cannot impose an economy of equality, an economy which will be developed throughout the world.</p>
      <p sl="el">Poor people have the right to life and we must find solutions. We are not going to measure standards in Europe by how many people drive a Mercedes 500, but by how many children do not have a glass of milk to drink in the morning.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, since 2004, economic growth in the new Member States has been in the order of 5.3%, which is 2% higher than in the old Member States. Export levels have doubled. Investments are increasing considerably. These results, which, as Mr Potočnik stated a moment ago, are emphatically and demonstrably underpinned by cohesion policy, are excellent. Statistically speaking, the number of poor regions is declining.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having said this, the regional differences in the Member States themselves are still massive. The Geringer de Oedenberg report is right to draw attention to this. I also notice that we have to be more critical of the commitment in the Member States themselves. Too much concentration in central, urban regions does not do much to further the cause of peripheral regions. The Member States too, together with the European Union, must opt in favour of a territorial approach towards their cohesion policy. When effectiveness is under scrutiny, we should make far more political assessments of the national plans that are submitted. Far more political because, ultimately, we fail to accelerate the economic development and cohesion in poor regions. A reassessment is therefore called for. A fourth cohesion report offers the framework in which this can be discussed. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will need to help take the lead in this. On 8 November, we will be organising a hearing on this in this House.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of conclusion, I should like to say that there are good results, good opportunities for cohesion policy, provided we focus more on synergy at European, national and regional level for the benefit of these poorer regions and resist a multi-speed Europe. Poorer regions, too, must find their rightful place in the knowledge economy and globalisation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg on her excellent report. These regions face a dual challenge in the implementation of the EU regional policy to absorb properly the allocated funds and to achieve the outcomes which are set in the aims for economic and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Special measures for these regions should be taken by the European Commission, governments and local authorities at all levels in order to achieve the best results for the citizens and the whole economic sector. What is mainly needed is specific technical support that will focus on the development of administrative capacity and improvement of coordination between management bodies at state and local levels. Otherwise, I agree with the Commissioner. Specific tailor-made solutions are needed reducing the institutional, administrative and economic shortcomings of these regions will increase the efficiency of EU financial assistance as a whole. The poorest regions must be encouraged to elaborate integrated plans for development as national documents which could serve as a basis for relating their specific features and potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States should be encouraged to improve the legislative framework in the field of public-private partnerships, making it a good basis for simple and transparent rules. But what the institution and the beneficiaries of these different programmes, including in my own country Bulgaria, need most is an even more active exchange of good practices, mainly amongst the new Member States, know-how transfer towards the central, regional and lowest possible local administrations and organisation of specific training on the whole cycle of project-making and implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are four key elements we should keep in mind: convergence, assistance, capacity for financial absorption and simplification of the rules. To conclude, all measures in the report are very important, including, of course, equal rights for men and women, which is a serious problem in these regions. I fully support the initiative for the adoption of a resolution specifically directed at the poorest EU regions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the fourth report on cohesion, recently published by the Commission, confirms that developmental disparities between the richest and the poorest regions in Europe are decreasing, something which was noted earlier.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Assuming that the strongest regions maintain a high, steady rate of economic growth, consolidated by a great deal of investment in innovation, we have to conclude that the weakest regions are displaying an increased rate of growth, allowing them to not only avoid lagging further behind, but even to make significant progress in terms of catching up. These facts also confirm the theory concerning the effectiveness of the European Union’s cohesion policy and the need to manage and develop it during the next programming periods.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report we are discussing concerns the poorest regions in the European Union not the poorest regions in the Member States, which are often relatively rich, on a European scale. Inter-regional disparities at a national level mainly fall within the remit of the national authorities and dealing with them should, especially in the so-called cohesion countries, be supported through European intervention.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A separate and courageous political decision needs to be taken to define what regions we consider to be the poorest and which require specific action to promote development. Let us remember that the Treaty provisions mention disparities between regions and that cohesion policy needs to cover not only the poorest regions in terms of per capita GDP, but also regions that have fallen behind others in terms of the level of innovation, development of a knowledge-based economy, attractiveness in relation to investment, geographical location and others.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Certain disparities may decrease with economic growth and a deeper common market, but new ones will appear. Cohesion policy has never been, and is not, a charitable activity and has to remain a flexible intervention tool for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, today, seven months after the start of the fourth programming period, and in the run-up to the debate on the future of political cohesion, the European Parliament emphasises in this report, on which I congratulate the rapporteur, that there is no room for failure in the new programming period.</p>
      <p sl="el">Cohesion policy must not only achieve the objectives it has set and strengthen growth and employment in the poorer regions; it must also manage to make its results visible, perceptible and acceptable to everyone at all levels.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First of all, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur for this highly successful, excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In order for the developments to take place in the regions that truly need them most, we need to take account of their distinctive features. It is evident that in the initial phase, inequalities within the countries showed an increase. Growth on a national average can be said to be good, although it is concentrated in the capital and in urban regions. Meanwhile, in the typically rural, village areas, there is increasing poverty and classic ghettoes have emerged.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This problem far surpasses the potential for rural development, and therefore any hope for change can be based only on deliberate harmonisation of the foundations and on complex developments. For this reason I consider it necessary to give priority to rural areas. Similarly, greater emphasis must be placed on helping minorities catch up, and on the training and retraining programmes related to this goal.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Further, I consider it important to increase the absorption capacity of the new Member States, and to further expand the technical aid that this demands. It is in this way that integration can become a tool for integrating the Europe of the regions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Mrs de Oedenberg’s report is not only excellent, resulting from her complete openness and ability to negotiate consensuses, but also highlights the strong regional disparities that exist throughout Europe, both in the new Member States and in the old ones, where a large part of the regions found themselves excluded from the group of poorest regions purely on the grounds of statistics that are not always complete or adequately compared and that, therefore, need to be improved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Coming, as I do, from an ultra-peripheral region, the island of Madeira, I have made several contributions with the following aims: guaranteeing the adaptation of the cohesion policy to the outermost regions, as mentioned in Article 29, section 2; achieving a clearer definition of the criteria for defining which regions are rich and which are poor; and reinforcing research and education as the path to development, because the regions in question need to find an effective way out of the situation in which they find themselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, without any doubt the poorest regions of Europe need attention. Some regions in Europe need special attention, for example, regions at a statistical disadvantage, the outermost and isolated regions and cities. It is important to focus on restructuring structural assistance and to pay more attention to the Lisbon goals of innovation, research and development, as these are activities which will create a solid base for the future economies of those regions. We should also pay heed to lowering energy consumption through renewable energies, which will provide a solid basis for the sustainable future of the relevant countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gender mainstreaming is a horizontal principle that we will follow in all our actions undertaken under all the structural funds. Absorption capacity is something on which we are focusing constantly. All this has received, and will continue to receive, constant attention.</p>
      <p sl="en">Solidarity with the poorest in Europe is the backbone of the European Union, especially after the two recent enlargements. We should not deny the problems, but we should not forget the good results we have achieved in the past. It is important to talk about both successes and problems, because this is a way of securing even greater recognition for cohesion policy and eliminating future problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should like thank you for the excellent Geringer report, your comments and your critical remarks. It is our duty to address the problems of the poorest in Europe.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this resolution is brought to plenary under Rule 91, as a result of urgency, without debate. It is certainly urgent and on my own behalf and on behalf of the five Members who have spent five days in Darfur, I would like very briefly to point out the reasons for this urgency.</p>
      <p sl="es">Darfur today is a lawless territory, in which everybody is waging war against everybody else. The great problems of our times are condensed there: the conflict between central and peripheral areas, ethnic conflicts, the cynical exploitation of rivalries between groups for political purposes, and perhaps the first war in the world to be caused by climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">But it is urgent because security is deteriorating even further, and if that continues, humanitarian workers will not be able to carry on doing their work. The fate of two and a half million people depends on that work, since they are fed each day thanks to their efforts, and partly thanks to European Union money.</p>
      <p sl="es">If there is no improvement in security between now and the end of the year, we may find that two million people have been abandoned to their fate in the desert, in danger of creating the greatest humanitarian crisis the world has ever seen.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that United Nations forces, which we have asked to be sent to Darfur so many times, finally go, now that the Sudanese Government has no objection. The Sudanese Government is no longer saying no. It is now saying yes. It says that they should go as soon as possible, because it is no longer capable – as if it ever wanted to – of guaranteeing the least security.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Janjaweed have not been disarmed. Quite the opposite. The Sudanese Government is not going to increase security in Darfur. If we want to avoid the risk of total humanitarian crisis, we must exert pressure in order to ensure that that force gets there as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, since it will take at least a year to get there, we must support the African Union and we must at least ensure that its soldiers are paid, because you should be aware that we have spent more money on supporting that force than on humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">Those are the reasons for the urgency, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I apologise for this, but colleagues will recognise that this situation is changing daily and the oral amendment is not quite the same as that listed on some people’s sheets so I will read it out: ‘Expresses its solidarity with the people of Pakistan who are victims of the violence perpetrated by the armed extremists; is deeply concerned for the safety of the 1800 or more people in the Red Mosque, some of whom were held as hostages; recognises the challenges the siege posed to the Government of Pakistan; expresses its grave concern about the still unknown number of victims and supports the efforts to bring those responsible to justice’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at the start of the vote on my report, I have to inform the House of two issues. First, when the vote was being prepared in the AFET Committee, all political groups agreed to use in this report only one term for the state which calls itself the Republic of Macedonia. It is the long sentence ‘Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’, without any abbreviation, such as the English FYROM or the French ARYM. I therefore propose that if parts of the final adopted text include any other terms, those terms should be replaced on the basis of this broad agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the PPE-DE Group proposed that I should merge two amendments on paragraph 13 into one – my amendment 22 and the PSE amendment 6. With this is mind, I should like to move an oral amendment to my amendment 22. As the vote on amendment 22 is due to be taken after the vote on amendment 6, this solution is only possible if amendment 6 is rejected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should therefore like to ask that the order of voting on the amendments be changed. Mr Pinior of the PSE Group said yesterday evening that he would be in favour of this arrangement.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I appreciated the fact that the notion of ‘responsibility to protect’ was raised in the resolution we voted on. This is not always about military intervention, but, obviously, the United Nations has this duty. Without it, the organisation would be reduced to a club of those who abuse the system and those who nod their approval.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Unfortunately, there are signs that the UN is incapable. The human tragedy that is the crisis in Darfur is a new blot in the copybook for the international community. Why is the UN more ready to address the problems of the Middle East than those of Africa? One reason for the crisis is ethnic marginalisation. and the key to a political solution lies in our ability to get all the parties concerned committed to peace talks. The background is also one of underdevelopment and environmental disaster. The crisis is the first climate change war. A humanitarian solution is also essential, therefore.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is of value that the EU should wish to take responsibility for resolving the problems of Darfur and other problems in Africa. I would hope that one day we will be able to say the same of the United States of America. Some might say that Europe suffers from a bad conscience on account of our history. That may be true, but it does not kill people. Silence and apathy kill.</p>

      <p sl="en">As is known, the level of solidarity granted to the Frontex, which is part of this integrated policy, has become almost a joke. Only one helicopter – the German helicopter – has been pledged, and perhaps it has not been noted that two neighbouring countries of Malta have, to all intents and purposes, closed their airspace. One has periodically refused entry of the German helicopter into its airspace; another has even threatened to bring it down. That is why I voted in this manner.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, it is, of course, the case that maritime Europe is facing all kinds of economic, social and ecological challenges that require a shared approach, but that is not what is at issue here. The question is whether a comprehensive European integrated maritime policy, with all the further rules and regulations that this will eventually entail, is necessary to address this issue.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As I see it, maritime policy and management in Europe would benefit far more from practice-based campaigns among Member States and other players aimed at far-reaching cooperation than from all kinds of new rules and regulations. What matters is coordination, exchange of information among the Member States, reducing the administrative burden and promoting maritime research. Under no circumstances, however, can the European Union interfere in matters that fall within the subsidiarity principle or market forces, such as coastal defence, physical planning or market regulation of sea ports.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This text, which is the European Parliament’s response to the Commission Green Paper on EU maritime policy, addresses many important points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It deals, in particular, with the challenge of climate change for maritime policy. European maritime policy must play an important role in this area by relying on a reduction in the CO2 emissions of ships, the possible integration of ships into the system of trading in emissions quotas and the promotion of renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is crucial that a lasting balance be found between the protection of the environment and the commercial exploitation of Europe’s oceans. Furthermore, I believe, as we have voted for it, that the Commission must reinforce all measures relating to civil and criminal liability in the event of an accident or incident and tighten vigilance with regard to the application of the rules on the mandatory use of double hulls.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report based on the Commission’s Green Paper towards a future maritime policy for the Union: a European vision for the oceans and seas, because I consider the promotion of a prosperous and sustainable maritime economy to be fundamental.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report presents an integrated political approach to the subject, putting forward concrete proposals with respect to navigation, naval and maritime security, tourism, fishing, ports policy, the marine environment, research, industry and land use, namely the proposal for the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases emanating from ships, and the creation of a European coastguard.</p>

When it comes to some of the measures proposed in this resolution, other than the legislative procedures, the majority in the European Parliament is, however, as usual going a bit over the top. The proposals increase bureaucracy and confirm the picture of the European Parliament as an institution with a pathological tendency to expand out of all proportion.</p>
      <p sl="sv">A number of the proposals in this report go too far, and I have therefore chosen to vote against this ‘opinion-soliciting report’ because I believe that it could have been drawn up in a pithier and more succinct way.

      <p sl="pt">We believe that a maritime policy based on cooperation between the different Member States and which, at community level, would mean a coordination of synergies to boost and give added value to the sea-related policies and measures defined by each country (such as fishing, transport, the environment and energy, among others) could have a positive impact.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this is not the option of Parliament’s own-initiative report, which chooses to promote the creation of a future ‘common maritime policy’, seeking to transfer central competencies of the Member States to the supranational level of the EU, an approach that, clearly, we reject.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To this end, we firmly reject amendment proposals affecting matters of principle on which we stand firm, such as:</p>
      <p sl="pt">Full respect for the sovereignty and competence of each Member State with regard to the management of its territorial waters and economic exclusion zones, specifically with respect to marine resources – namely biological resources – and questions of security, rescue and the inspection and control of shipping in their waters;</p>

      <p sl="fr">The deterioration of the oceans’ ecosystem has serious consequences for the planet and human activities: fishery stocks are disappearing and the role of the climate and the oceans as regulators is diminishing.

      <p sl="pt">The first railway package was launched with the announced objective of ‘launching the bases of modal shift’. In other words, it promoted a shift from road transport to railway transport. But what it actually sought to do, in the manner of a Trojan horse, was to hide the opening up of railway transport, namely goods transport, to competition and private interests as a first step towards the total liberalisation of the railway sector at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have denounced and rejected the intentions of this process right from the word ‘go’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As with other EU-promoted liberalisations, whatever is going badly at any given moment is used as a starting point (concealing the true causes of such situations, namely the systematic policies to dismantle and weaken the public transport sector) to justify liberalising methods and point to the said ‘competition’ – with no clear explanation as to how or why – as the solution for all ills, some kind of miracle worker, but which, in the end, bears the consequences that we have already pointed out.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Public investment in the railway sector in accordance with the needs and options defined by each country is undoubtedly of vital importance, but not for the purpose of handing it over to the profit logic of the large public interests, which seek to dominate this public sector, fundamental in every country, by means of its liberalisation at EU internal market level.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Cramer report states correctly that, in the transport of goods, environmental issues have been neglected. That is the consequence of the expansion of freight transport on the highways and by air, and at the same time the continuing reduction of transport by rail. The report recalls the promotion of road and air transport by means of financial instruments, which are also used to reduce rail transport. We would point out that many railway links to factories and harbours have recently been closed. However, we differ with the rapporteur on the capacities of the free market to solve this problem. The rapporteur, together with the rightist groups in this Parliament, is of the opinion that free competition in trans-border transport is the best solution. The advocates of this view refer to the situation on the road and in the air, and expect that competition automatically attracts a new wave of companies interested. In practice we have seen that, until now, there have been no such positive results. Despite this lack of reality, the rest of the report deserves our full support.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am voting for a revitalisation of rail transport as the core element of EU transport policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is, however, essential that rail transport should become the core element of EU transport policy for the following reasons: a growing traffic problem, rising emission levels, limited energy resources and an increase in the death toll from transport accidents.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore call for the presentation of the second directive on transport infrastructure costs by 2008, prescribing a uniform system of tolls on all roads in the EU for goods vehicles weighing 3.5 tonnes or more. In addition, the so-called external costs, in other words the environmental costs arising from transport operations, must be factored into infrastructure charges. In this context I must also refer to the extremely beneficial Swiss system of the emission-linked HGV levy, through which Switzerland has achieved remarkable success in shifting transport from road to rail, while the improved efficiency of road haulage has restricted the increase in consumer costs to half a percentage point.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The first railway package, which was intended to open up the market to international goods transport by rail by 15 March 2003 has had some degree of success. However, shortcomings and delays in transposition by the Member States can still be observed. Well, the consequences of these delays have repercussions on the restructuring of the railway enterprises and on the creation of a truly competitive market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a number of aspects are still lacking for us to be able to reap the positive effects of the first railway package, we believe that resources must be created to correct the failings with regard to the execution of the legislation by the Member States. To achieve this, is it going to be necessary for us to have an independent and transparent national monitoring body with sufficient resources at its disposal to take an active stance against the existing distortions of the competition? We also need measures related to the creation of true interoperability – the lack of which in the railway networks is still the main obstacle to the realisation of an integrated European railway area – such as the rapid installation of the European Rail Traffic Management system, especially in the priority rail transport corridors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Dezvoltarea transportului feroviar de mare viteză pentru pasageri trebuie să se realizeze cu prioritate în toate statele Uniunii Europene. Investiţiile în infrastructura de transport şi pentru modernizarea sistemului rulant sunt foarte mari, dar şi beneficiile aduse vor fi pe măsură.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report on sustainable mobility for our continent, which we have just voted on, not only stresses the need to build up a better infrastructure, but implies that this must be done responsibly and respectfully. It points out that Member States must keep an eye on the environmental impact of improved infrastructure as well as examining transport, while taking into account socio-economic factors vis-à-vis safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is particularly relevant to my own country, Ireland, where we are currently badly in need of making the preservation of natural, historic landmarks a priority. The Irish authorities are in the process of destroying one of the most important archaeological sites in Europe in a bid to improve transport systems in Ireland. Forty-one sites which comprise European heritage, including the national monument at Lismullen, will be demolished due to a motorway that is unnecessarily routed through it. Once these monuments are destroyed, there is no way to replace the cultural heritage that will be lost with them.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the sustainable mobility report, future transport policy will have to optimise each country’s own potential to meet the objectives of clean and efficient transport systems. Ireland can achieve this, but a motorway through Tara is not the answer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Irish authorities have not considered alternative routes and, instead, by road construction are destroying significant historical locations like the site at Baronstown which was destroyed six days ago at 4 a.m. in the morning. Nor have they considered reviving an old rail line in the area to carry commuters to Dublin, thus reducing road traffic and fuel consumption. We should return to the old methods of transport like the train that used to be operated near Tara.</p>
      <p sl="en">While I agree with this sustainable Europe and better transport infrastructure, I firmly believe that we cannot and should not sacrifice one of our most precious archaeological sites for a misplaced motorway.</p>

      <p sl="de">Following the production of a detailed review by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, six years after the publication of the White Paper on Transport, I wish to express my support for the realisation of the trans-European networks and for the use of intelligent transport systems and technological innovations.</p>
      <p sl="de">I deplore the lack of financial activity in the development of infrastructure, which poses a great risk to economic growth in Europe. EU funds for the trans-European networks remain limited, and yet the real benefit of the TEN-T programme can only be achieved if the entire network is built. I therefore call on the Commission to present proposals for a possible extension of new options and of innovative funding mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to the adverse environmental effects of transport, it has been demonstrated that even a modest shift in the modal balance would considerably reduce congestion on the roads. For this reason I eagerly await the assessment of external environmental costs which the Commission is to present by 2008.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Barsi-Pataky report does not really bring us any further forward, which is why I have abstained from voting. It is all well and good to renew our commitment to the trans-European transport network and to proclaim that even a small shift in the modal balance would considerably reduce congestion on the roads. It must be remembered, however, that many routes, particularly within cities, are congested because the state of local public transport makes it an unappealing alternative. Apart from paying mere lip service to the principle, the EU has scarcely come up with any intelligent solutions in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the highly controversial gigaliners, there is no reason why the general public should pay the price in terms of higher road-maintenance costs and increased safety risks for the sake of possible savings for hauliers. If we want environmental protection to be writ large – and indeed environmental arguments are being advanced for these gigantic HGVs – intensified efforts are needed to forge ahead with environment-friendly propulsion systems. The European Parliament could set a good example in this respect with its own pool of chauffeur-driven vehicles.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Dissatisfaction with the application and results of the European transport policy is not a denial of improvements that have been made, from safety of the transport to the quality of the service or in terms of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, much remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Restrictions in community funding are among the main causes of the shortcomings of this policy. The only way to avoid delays and the reorientation of priorities would be by adopting innovative forms of funding, such as public-private partnerships and the subsidising of the projects by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Community funds for the financing of trans-European transport projects are limited. This is why they should be focused on trans-border stretches whose added value will enable the realisation of an interlinked and interoperable trans-European transport network.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is, however, fundamental to avoid creating a patchwork of national networks, so the Commission must, in cooperation with the Member States, ensure the application and execution of the European transport legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, reinforced cooperation at European, national, regional and local levels is necessary for links between good practices and between the transport policy and other national or community policies on matters such as energy, the environment, tourism and innovation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We voted in favour of this Resolution because we know that the reality of cardiovascular disease is a concern. It is important to increase knowledge about the prevention of the risk factors for these diseases. Thus, it is important that the actions contained in this Resolution be taken into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that health is complete physical, mental and social well-being. Major contradictions are to be found, however, in today’s stress-ridden society, where there is little time to rest, to spend with our families, to take care of our physical health and psychological equilibrium, further added to poor nutrition and a lack of time for physical exercise, as well as a loss of rights in the workplace, namely overloaded working hours and a reduction in holiday entitlement, not to mention unemployment or the permanent threat thereof. All this has serious repercussions on peoples’ lives, on their equilibrium and, consequently, on the proliferation of cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this awareness and prevention campaign for cardiovascular disease should not be transformed into a banner for communitising health.

I welcome the call in the resolution for the establishment of an EU-wide database to monitor cardiovascular disease prevalence, mortality, morbidity and risk factors.

      <p sl="sk">Following Malta and Cyprus, Slovakia’s bid to join the eurozone will be reviewed next year.

      <p sl="pt">The report ‘welcomes the favourable economic developments achieved in 2006’ in the euro zone but fails to disguise certain concerns and risks relating to the future development of the euro zone. The truth is that the profits, as a percentage of GDP, are at one of the highest ever levels, whilst salaries continue to slow down and grow below the rate of labour productivity; in other words, the gains in productivity are still going to the employers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report ignores social tensions and says little about the increase in inequality and poverty in the EU, about increasingly precarious employment and about high unemployment rates. It is increasingly difficult to justify new salary freezes and ask for further tightening of the belt when the fruits of wealth continue, as ever, to go to the financial and economic groups.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In truth, what they seek to ignore is that the main issue to consolidate this moment in the economic cycle is to make salaries rise and public investment increase in order to stimulate demand.

      <p sl="sv">The report provides a clear picture of how EMU goes hand in hand with the creation of an EU state. The report seeks closer coordination of the economic policies of the Member States. The euro area’s external representation is viewed as needing to be strengthened, and internal coordination in the external scene as needing to be improved.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, it is noted that, for example, competitiveness is developing in different directions within the euro area and that the euro’s increase in value against, for example, the US dollar has had different effects in different Member States depending on the latter’s economic structures and the elasticity of their manufacturing industries. The report also points out that the ECB’s monetary policy can never be completely in tune with the situation in any particular Member State.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It was precisely these factors that were put forward as arguments by the ‘no’ side in the referendum on EMU in Sweden in 2003 and that met with sympathy among a large majority of Swedish voters.</p>

We must not forget that Article 105 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community makes provision for the ESCB to support the general economic policies in the Community, without prejudice to the objective of price stability, with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives laid down in Article 2. That is, in particular, to promote balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and social protection and a high degree of competitiveness and convergence of economic performance.

As for European monetary policy, one can only continue to deplore its failure to meet the needs of the Member States of the euro zone, the eight increases in the European Central Bank’s reference rate in 18 months, their dubious motives and the continued absence of any exchange-rate policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It may be noted above all, and this is my second remark, that, despite the process – which I consider unwarranted – of reforming the Treaties, there is no question whatsoever of calling into question the stated objective of this policy in order to finally force the Frankfurt-based Bank to support growth and employment over the ideological creation of a European monetary area.

      <p sl="pt">The situation in Palestine is a cause for great concern. Apart from proving that the nub of the issue is not Israel – something that a great many people have said many times – it also demonstrates two unfortunate truths. On the one hand, there are groups ready and willing to do anything to get power by force and to use it violently; on the other, since the Authority’s very survival is threatened, it is a partner that is unable to make agreements or to set its own house in order.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What we all need – the Middle East, Israel and Europe – is to have a partner across the table that is reliable enough to negotiate with and strong enough to implement what is agreed. Without that, we cannot have successful peace negotiations. Yet it is also impossible to agree on peace and security without determination. Our unequivocal aim should be nothing less than to guarantee the peaceful and secure coexistence of two States. To achieve that, we have to acknowledge what the real obstacles to peace and security are, instead of handing out blame, as often happens, as if all actions were equivalent.</p>

      <p sl="el">The resolution by the European Parliament on the situation in the Middle East endeavours through hypocritical crowing to conceal the imperialist policy of the EU in the area. It hides the huge responsibility of the ΕU, the policy of equating perpetrators with victims and the imperialist interventions by the EU/USA and ΝΑΤΟ which are perpetuating the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and the crimes by the Israeli Government against the Palestinian people.</p>
      <p sl="el">The imperialist interventions by the USA/ΝΑΤΟ and the EU for a ‘New Middle East’ and the adventurous policy of Israel in the area as a whole are responsible for the dangerous situation in the Palestinian territories, in Lebanon and in the area as a whole. The immediate withdrawal of the Israeli occupying army from the Palestinian territories, the foundation of an independent Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem and an end to imperialist interventions in the countries of the Middle East are basic demands of the fight of the people in the area.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This explanation of vote serves only to emphasise that, despite reference in the resolution of some of the most important aspects of the current situation in Pakistan, its content effectively conceals the participation by the Pakistani Government in the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan by the USA and its allies, and in their subsequent ‘replacement’ by NATO. There is no mention of the pressure that the Pakistani authorities have already admitted to having suffered at the hands of the USA and its European allies to aid in the attack on Afghanistan. Likewise, there is no mention of the bombardments carried out by NATO on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have resulted in the deaths of many innocent civilians on both sides of the border.</p>

Quite the contrary. The fundamental values and the non-renounceable nature of democracy are worthy of our defence and it is in this spirit that the European Union will handle its relations with Pakistan, especially on the eve of elections. That said, it is nevertheless necessary to underline the fact that recent events at the Red Mosque prove – as if any proof were still needed – that radical Islamism is a very real, very dangerous and very active threat.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The Macedonia that I got to know for the first time in 1962 boasted many features dating back to previous centuries, with traditional cottages, dirt tracks, transport by horse and cart, traditional dress and different ethnic groups living juxtaposed to one another. The Macedonia 45 years on is the result of far-reaching developments since.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the 1990s, the European Union, as I see it, made serious mistakes when Yugoslavia inevitably fell apart. This break-up was denied for too long and, when it was recognised, we chose to ignore the remaining ethnic diversity. In some cases, the wrong borders were recognised, military means were deployed unnecessarily and a decision was made in favour of inappropriate interference. This damage was proportionately limited in Macedonia. As rapporteur, I hope I can contribute to peace, democracy, reconciliation and progress in that country. The 558 votes with which this House supported my report are a step in the right direction of Macedonia’s accession to the European Union, which was previously pledged but has so far been unsuccessful. I hope that in the next annual report we will be able to read that major obstacles to accession have been removed and that the Council has opened the accession negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="de">I voted against the report from my fellow group member, Erik Meijer, on the ‘Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’ because, contrary to the opinion of the rapporteur, the Committee on Foreign Affairs inserted the following wording in point 3 of the report: the European Parliament, it says, ‘commends the Macedonian Government for its cooperation in the field of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), notably its participation in the EU mission Althea and its willingness to contribute to the development of the ESDP capabilities and future EU-led civilian and military crisis-management missions’.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a catastrophic position to adopt. This point welcomes the ‘CFSP’, which in reality is a militarisation of the EU. The adopted formula obliges a potential applicant country to take part already in the military component of the EU and to arm itself in order to contribute to the development of ‘ESDP capabilities’. It welcomes the Althea mission. Among other things, the Althea mission symbolises the financial fiddling that takes place in connection with military missions of the EU through mechanisms, such as Athena, which are not subject to parliamentary control. The European Parliament should not be a party to measures designed to perpetuate the militarisation of the EU. The rest of the report is better than the usual European Parliament reports on Balkan countries.</p>

Accordingly, European Union policy should aim at making the maximum amount of affordable pharmaceutical products available within developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Thus, millions of human beings are being deprived of their right to health. Research into finding a cure is orientated towards the ‘palliative’, since ongoing disease is more lucrative. Capitalism commercialises life.</p>

There are several regions that have become statistically richer than they really are purely as a result of enlargement. To withdraw them from the support framework would not only be unfair but also an error with regard to the political objectives adhered to thus far. Secondly, it is important that the cohesion policies be adapted to the new economic reality. The causes of underdevelopment and poverty, or, to put it another way, the factors contributing to such a situation, are different today, hence the need to tailor and adapt these policies, so that current funding does not only respond to old imbalances.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I support the strategy deployed by the Union to help its outermost regions, but I call on the Commission to clarify quickly the content of the ‘strengthened partnership’ that it has adopted – not least in terms of improving the regions’ competitiveness – and the action plan for the wider neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The structural policies conducted in the outermost regions would have an even greater impact if the Commission demonstrated greater flexibility by agreeing to rid itself, as and when necessary, of certain ‘Community dogmas’ and by taking greater account of the particular characteristics of these regions.</p>

      <p sl="el">The Greek Communist Party is radically opposed to and voted against the report on the effectiveness of the EU’s cohesion policy. The EU data used in the report prove precisely the opposite. The contrasts and inequalities between the Member States and the various regions of the EU are increasing and deepening. One revealing example when it comes to the myth of the alleged convergence and cohesion between the Member States of the EU is Greece, where the per capita gross domestic product was 44.78% of the Community average in 1960, 71.79% in 1980 before it joined what was then the EEC and just 66.59% twenty-plus years later in 2002.</p>
      <p sl="el">EU policy not only fails to reduce inequalities and poverty; on the contrary, it increases them to the utmost degree. It paves the way for the plundering by monopoly capital of the wealth-producing resources of the Member States of the EU and for stepping up the exploitation of their people. The objective of the so-called ‘cohesion policy’ is not the alleged cohesion; it is to formulate the terms of survival of the workers at the lowest possible level, just one step before poverty, in order to contain social outcry, which is, however, inevitable.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, Iraq is today in a catastrophic abyss and the Iraqi people find themselves in a state of utter despair and shock. The confirmed statistics provided by international agencies, such as the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq and other UN organisations, are truly grim and heartbreaking. Every day on average one hundred people are killed and two hundred wounded; 50% of the population is living on less than one dollar a day and unemployment affects more than 80% of the population. Only a minority have access to adequate water supplies and effective sanitation. Electricity supply is severely restricted and is subject to frequent interruptions without warning. Four out of five doctors have left their hospitals and three out of four children are not at school.</p>
      <p sl="en">Almost three million people are internally displaced, i.e. they are refugees in their own country, and this number increases by about 2000 every day. A further two million Iraqis are refugees in neighbouring states, namely Syria, Jordan, the Gulf region, Egypt and Iran. These people have no formal refugee protection status.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and the international community in general have a moral duty to show compassion and understanding for the miserable circumstances the Iraqi refugees find themselves in. Additionally, and more importantly, they must take much more effective measures to ensure that these poor people are given the help and support they so desperately need in order to survive indignity and the calamity that has fallen upon them.</p>
      <p sl="en">This joint motion for a resolution lists a number of measures that are of importance in helping the Iraqi refugees have a more human existence.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far, I have spoken as a representative of my group, now permit me to say a few words on a personal basis. Iraq is a relatively new country: it only became independent from Britain in 1932. It then followed a history of turmoil and, eventually, Saddam Hussein came to power. He was a tyrant and a criminal but he was assisted in gaining power by the West, including, unfortunately, some European states.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, though, even the worst days of Saddam Hussein’s totalitarian rule seem nothing in comparison to the death, destruction and suffering that has fallen on the Iraqi people following the Bush-Blair invasion and continued occupation of the country. These two ‘peacekeepers’ ordered an attack on Iraq, promising to bring happiness and prosperity to the Iraqi people. Instead, they succeeded in bringing a calamity of gigantic proportions. Yet some EU circles continue to applaud this invasion and, recently, they have even agreed to rewarding Mr Blair for his ‘peace’ services to the Arab world by appointing him Special Representative of the Quartet to the Middle East. May God bring some sanity to such circles and may God save us from the Bushes and Blairs of this world !</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I shall read Tobias Pflüger’s speech. ‘Sadly, not until today have we held a debate on assistance for the Iraqi refugees. I deeply regret that. Why did the liberal, right-wing nationalist and conservative groups drop the subject from the agenda of the last plenary part-session? Instead, the House engaged in ideological debates about Cuba.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation in Iraq is desperate. Since the US invasion and the formation of the so-called ‘coalition of the willing’, more than 600 000 people have been killed. More than two million Iraqis have fled the country. To these may be added two million within the country who have been driven from their homes and more than 40 000 non-Iraqi refugees. The number of US service personnel who have lost their lives rises daily and has now reached 3 600. Regrettably, through their participation in the war and their support of the war, Member States of the EU – and Germany is one of the foremost culprits – bear a substantial share of responsibility for the situation in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="de">Real help must now be given to the refugees. That cannot be the task of the neighbouring countries alone. The EU must commit funds for this purpose. Deportations to Iraq must be brought to an immediate halt. The troops of the United States and its allies in the so-called coalition of the willing must be withdrawn. EU Member States must stop supporting the war. An end to the illegal war and the occupation of Iraq is imperative.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was one of those politicians who supported the Iraq war back in 2003 in the belief that Saddam Hussein posed a serious long-term risk to regional stability, but also because of the horrendous brutality of his Baathist regime. I believed this would be replaced by democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I, like many others, sadly underestimated the ferocity of the subsequent insurgency and the serious lack of peace planning, post-invasion, by our US allies, in particular their disastrous dismantling of the Iraqi army as a de-Baathification measure, which unleashed disgruntled Sunni officers to lend their expertise to the insurgency. There was also a failure to secure the Jordanian and Syrian borders against jihadi extremists flocking in to have a bash at the allies, not to mention that Saddam opened his jails before his fall, which added organised crime to this lethal cocktail, and always with the fingers of Iran meddling on the side of the Shias in what has now become virtually a civil war.</p>
      <p sl="en">Curiously, immediately after the invasion, there was little in the way of internally displaced persons or refugees compared to the previous exodus of Kurds in the Saddam days. Paradoxically, the Kurdish flow has now stopped, as this is one of the few remaining peaceful areas of the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, in the last two years, huge numbers of Iraqis – perhaps over two million – have left, particularly the long-suffering, persecuted Christian Assyrian minorities who have been squeezed on all sides by Islamists, who accuse them of collaborating with the crusaders, and by the Kurds, who want their lands. Canon Andrew White, who ran Iraq’s only Anglican Church, left Baghdad yesterday amid fears for his life and safety after trying to secure the release of five kidnapped Britons.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the EU must now do more to alleviate the crisis by boosting financial aid to the surrounding Arab states, which have received the bulk of the refugees, in particular Jordan and Syria, and they have been particularly good at taking in the Assyrians. The EU Member States must also accept, within reason, more refugees on a temporary basis.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Iraqi brothers and sisters, an initial word in memory of all those who have been deprived of their most precious asset because of their ethnic or religious origin, their real or presumed convictions, or for being a symbol of democratic courage and public spirit. Allow me to put the spotlight on my comrade, companion and friend, the Member of Parliament Mohammad Hossein Ahwad, the very embodiment of the fight against theocratic fascism, who was assassinated on 12 April in the Iraqi parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order that the blinding tears of pain do not prevent us from seeing those women who still fight to keep their children alive on the pathways of ethnic cleansing, the countless thousands of Iraqis gazing into infinity on the streets of Amman, Damascus and Cairo, profoundly affected victims of post-traumatic syndromes, the camps set up in squares or in the buttresses of ruined churches or mosques, I would like to send a message of solidarity, love, affection and hope to all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot begin to imagine, nor can these words express, the barbarity of the forces of darkness who rehearsed their plan for the entire greater Middle East on the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the resolution and, like others, I am really concerned about the truly tragic situation that we see in Iraq and on its borders at the moment. This is a people that have already suffered war, ethnic cleansing, a brutal dictatorship, an illegal invasion and communal violence, and are now seeing borders closing both externally and internally, seeing little chance of resettlement, and seeing a very mixed reception should any of them make it to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should not be surprised when war produces refugees – it always does – and indeed, as has already been said, some of our Member States have a very grave responsibility for that situation. I would agree, for once, with Mr Tannock, certainly on the question of the lack of post-war planning.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly welcome, in this resolution, the statement that there should be no forced return of Iraqi refugees, or of those who have had their claims turned down that are currently living in the European Union, and at present we certainly need to find a status for such people, rather than leaving them destitute in our own Member States, as is happening in some places.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say that there is no part of Iraq which is currently safe. Even in Kurdistan we see Turkish troops at the moment massing on the borders there, undermining the possibility of return to destroyed villages and undermining efforts to increase economic stability in that area. Indeed, some of those that have been returned were sent back wearing flak jackets and helmets, which, to me, says it is not exactly a safe area. We also had a report from Human Rights Watch only last week saying that, despite the efforts of authorities in Kurdistan, partisan security forces continue the practice of kidnap and torture, so there is no real safe area in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that we have to increase our support to the countries dealing with refugees on the border, and to the UNHCR, because we know what happens when you ignore the plight of refugees at the border. We only have to look at our experience when we more or less turned our back on two million Afghan refugees on the Pakistani border and left them without adequate support – that vacuum is filled, and we do not always like the result.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the call, in the resolution, for the Commission to explain to Parliament’s Committee on Budgets in more detail exactly how we are helping in Iraq and how we are aiming to support those surrounding countries. But, equally, I think we should be looking at our own resettlement policies to at least offer assistance to some of those who, once again, are finding their lives absolutely in turmoil.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the humanitarian and human rights situation in Iraq is constantly deteriorating. This is what the reports of the UN aid mission to Iraq reveal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The statistics are horrifying. On average, around one hundred people die every day and over two hundred are injured. 50% of the population live on less than a dollar a day and the unemployment rate stands at 80%. There are insufficient water supplies and the sewage systems are inefficient, which encourages the spread of disease. Three quarters of children do not attend school. Criminal activity, armed attacks, kidnappings, killings of people involved in political activities or rebuilding the country are all everyday occurrences. That is why many Iraqis flee their country and over two million people have become internally displaced. It should also be highlighted that there are over forty thousand refugees from other countries on Iraqi soil, including fifteen thousand Palestinians. This is what Iraq looks like today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We therefore need immediate political and humanitarian action in order to alleviate the tragic situation faced by the refugees. We should remember that half a million of the refugees are children. We should ensure that internally displaced people are registered, which will give them the right to obtain food rations. Today, they are denied this right. We should also exert influence on neighbouring countries, so that they cease to place entry restrictions on the refugees, thus forcing many to remain on the borders.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Union must make sure that the aid we send to Iraq, to the Iraqi people, is comprehensive, sustainable and coordinated with the actions of the United States. The Union should, once and for all, reject anti-American prejudice. It is the only way in which we will be able to relieve the incredibly difficult situation faced by millions of refugees and therefore avoid a large-scale humanitarian crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We also call on the Iraqi Government to take immediate action to ensure the safety of displaced people and to cease to discriminate against people on the basis of their background. The European Commission, meanwhile, should increase humanitarian aid to all displaced people in Iraq and provide support to neighbouring countries that already provide this kind of aid.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the plight of the Iraqi refugees is still a serious one, except for one move in the right direction. The recommendation by the UN’s main delegate for refugee affairs to give refugee status to the asylum seekers of southern and central Iraq under the 1951 Convention was a welcome solution. As is the offer of additional forms of protection in cases where refugee status is not given.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I wish to raise two matters in particular, from within Iraq’s borders. Firstly, the status of religious minorities is becoming ever more intolerable. Assyrian, Armenian, Orthodox and other Christian groups, as well as Mandaeans and Jews are being glaringly discriminated against in the labour market and elsewhere. In certain areas the authorities are totally incapable of protecting minorities from violence inflicted by Muslim soldiers. Freedom of religion is in fact virtually non-existent.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Secondly, I find incredible the threats which the Iraqi authorities have made to freeze the supply of vital goods to Iranian refugees. These members of the opposition have refugee status under international law and an inalienable right to protection.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we must admit that what is happening and what has happened in Iraq is much worse than civil war – a question that is often posed. Of course, there is not civil war. It is worse. There is total chaos. Nobody has any idea or any plan as to how to unravel the mess we put Iraq in. I use the word ‘put’ because what went on was not needed, not required, nor was it wanted. It was an invasion which has proved a terrible nightmare for those who have participated in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">When one makes a mistake, one has to carry the responsibility for it. It is about time that those people who participated, those countries in the coalition as well as the willing partners, show responsibility for what has happened to the Iraqi people, especially the refugees who are seeking help – even if they find any help, they find only a minimum amount.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, almost hidden amongst the constant news of violence in Iraq is the almost unheard voice of Iraq’s Christian minority. This small population has no protection and is almost unknown to the international community. They are experiencing intense waves of violent persecution. Christian Iraqis are faced with the choice of exile – if they can manage to escape – conversion or persecution.</p>
      <p sl="de">The persecution takes many forms: violence, discrimination in the workplace, confiscation of property, etc. For a Chaldean Christian priest, Ragheed Aziz Ganni, this persecution resulted in death.</p>
      <p sl="de">What will the European Community do to help the Chaldean, Assyrian and Orthodox Christian communities?

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is a good thing to table a resolution on Iraq for the sake of the humanitarian situation, refugees, international aid and so on. Who would not agree, moreover, with recital A and its finding that 100 people are killed and 200 are wounded each day, 70% of the population is without water, 3 million people are undernourished and 2 million are refugees, including 500 000 children in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Who has done this, though? Who is responsible? Who has spread chaos? Is it Saddam Hussein? Is it the Ba’ath Party? Chaos stems from war, an unjust war in the eyes of the theologians of the Middle Ages, an illegal war according to the UN Charter, a war started on the back of a lie told by two Heads of State, those of the US and the United Kingdom. Who supported this war, here, in the European Parliament? Who justified, who requested, who approved the intervention that led to chaos? The current French foreign affairs minister, Mr Kouchner, and some of the signatories to this resolution did.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are we supposed to say? That it is good to be humanitarian and to deal with the effects, but that it is better to be preventive and to avert the causes? This is the problem of political Europe! In Europe we are so fond of human rights that, everywhere – in Palestine, in Iraq, in Africa, in the field of economic globalisation – we support policies that, violating as they do these human rights, enable us to reaffirm our immense love of these very human rights, which are ultimately violated with our prior support. It is therefore good that post-trauma centres for refugees are being proposed in paragraph 16, but provision must also be made for political prevention centres, here, for our leaders, so that they can be taught wisdom, lucidity and the courage to say 'no', and taught to reject naïve optimism, which destroys everything in its wake.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I support the resolution, and I sympathise with more than four million Iraqis who have been forced to flee from their birthplaces. That is more people than there are in my homeland, Lithuania. The number of refugees is growing, and half of them are forced to flee abroad. The situation in Iraq is not improving. The refugees are condemned to vegetate in poverty, usually without employment, while their children grow up illiterate. For these reasons, terrorist organisations are able to successfully recruit followers.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Humanitarian assistance for refugees is shamefully small compared to the amount spent on weapons by the USA and UK, the countries that launched the war on Iraq. The 60 million US dollars contributed by donors in the USA is just a drop in the ocean.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This year about 40 000 refugees from Iraq will arrive in European Union countries – twice as many as last year – while the USA has accepted barely a several dozen Iraqis this year.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the security deterioration in Iraq has provoked a large scale displacement: approximately two million Iraqis have fled within the borders of Iraq and approximately two million into the neighbouring countries, with 750 000 people in Jordan and 1.4 million people in Syria. This displacement may result in a humanitarian crisis, and could present a threat to regional stability and the Commission is extremely concerned about the scale of human suffering.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are following the situation closely on the ground and constantly reviewing any developments. We are in close contact with other key players of the international community, such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. In this regard, the Commission has actively participated at the UNHCR International Conference last April in Geneva.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of existing assistance, in order to alleviate the difficulties of the displaced, the Commission, via EuropeAid, allocated EUR 10 million in 2006 to support internally displaced persons. In February 2007, as a rapid response to the deteriorating situation and following the UNHCR appeal in January, the Commission, via ECHO, announced an additional allocation of EUR 10.2 million, composed of EUR 4 million for the internally displaced and EUR 6.2 million for the externally displaced Iraqis. Furthermore, the Commission is continuing its support of the delivery of basic services inside Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">We understand that this support remains limited in the face of the scale of human suffering. Nevertheless, it constitutes only a first, immediate response to the humanitarian situation. The Commission is currently looking at various options on how to better assist the Iraqi refugees in the future. However, delivery of assistance inside Iraq is severely constrained by the security situation. Many of our partners, including UNHCR, have only a very minimal presence in Iraq.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through various technical and political missions, the Commission attempts to better assess the situation and, at the same time, convey its readiness to further support the Iraqi refugees. Commissioner Michel visited the region himself at the end of April. Several technical missions to Jordan and Syria have also followed since then.</p>
      <p sl="en">We remain, therefore, committed to working with the countries that are accommodating Iraqi refugees. The Commission has already and will retain regular discussions with the Syrian and Jordan authorities about the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are looking forward particularly to participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh agreed Working Group on Refugees, which, according to the latest indication, is scheduled to meet on 22 July in Amman. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has already expressed the Commission’s readiness to provide technical assistance to the working group in order to facilitate the process.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Moldova, and in particular the Transnistrian region, have been the subject of previous resolutions of this House. Since the 1992 conflict in Moldova, which led to the establishment of the separatist and illegitimate regime in the Transnistrian region, there have been numerous and serious violations of the human rights of the affected citizens of Moldova. These violations, which continue to happen today, range from severe limitations of the freedom of speech to arbitrary arrest and detention and use of torture on political opponents and civil rights activists.</p>
      <p sl="en">Calls by the international community in defence of the human rights of the Moldovian citizens living in Transnistria have, to a large extent, been ignored. Even the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights against Moldova and its allied Russian Federation in respect of violations that have taken place in Transnistria, have been completely ignored by the separatist Transnistrian regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">We strongly condemn the repression, harassment and persecution of citizens and NGOs currently taking place in Transnistria and which is the work of the totalitarian Transnistrian regime. We call for a rapid settlement of the frozen conflict in that region pointing out adamantly that the territorial integrity of Moldova must never be put in doubt, and that the regime in Tiraspol is illegal and unrecognised, and so it will remain in our eyes and in our decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since Moldova is located in the EU’s immediate neighbourhood, and especially since this country has apparent EU membership aspirations, the EU must continue to be a key player in assisting the Moldovan people to achieve eventually the peace and prosperity they so much deserve in a unified and a conflict-free democratic nation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today we are dealing with the sort of unwanted legacy that was left behind after the fall of the Soviet Union. In order to strengthen its internal power, the Soviet Union tried to ensure that there was as much migration within its borders as possible. This is the cause of the problems in all of the former republics, where the Russian minority forms a large part of the local community. It is also the reason behind the problems in the Caucasus, the Baltic states and Transnistria.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, whereas in those countries the Russian minorities pose a real threat, as they generally side with Russia and, as the heirs of the former Soviet Union, seek Russian support, in Moldova the integrity of the state has, to a large extent, been destroyed because the Russian minority was so large that it led to the creation of a separate territory within Moldova which proclaimed itself the Republic of Transnistria.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be aware that this political lawlessness, which the Russian leaders in Transnistria have allowed, is clearly and directly reflected in infringements of basic human rights and the persecution of the Moldavian people (de facto Romanians) and has clearly also led to another kind of lawlessness, as political lawlessness does not stand alone for long and criminal lawlessness soon follows. The numerous gangs that control public life in Moldova as well as the various violations of the law that occur there particularly affect the lives of the inhabitants of this part of the country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would simply like to point out that possible future independence, following the example of Kosovo, where the majority is made up of Albanians in an autonomous Serbian territory, could result in the Russian people in the Transnistrian region maintaining their resistance to the rightful Moldovan authorities.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, to the EU Commissioner for Science and Research I would first like to say that they will still one day undertake scientific ventures in Moldova and Transnistria I am sure, but before then they have to have peace, bread and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Along with the Balkan region, Europe’s centres of political grievances are Moldova and its enclave, Transnistria. No peaceful solution has been found to stabilise the situation, even though a good deal of external forces with their many international declarations have been helping to seek one.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We are paying special attention to the conclusions of the meetings of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Ilascu and others versus Moldova and the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is only right that here in the European Parliament we should be once again focusing our attention on the need for stability in the region and people’s security, and so ultimately, the prevention of poverty. Poverty leads to the violation of human rights and, in the case of Moldova, large-scale, illegal human trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Our group’s resolution calls on the Council of the European Union and the Commission to step up efforts to find a solution to the conflict in Transnistria which is acceptable to all parties and makes it the responsibility of all those involved to prevent problems from escalating. We need to get this region, Europe’s poorest, back on its feet.</p>

      <p sl="et">To our knowledge, there are at present no political prisoners in Trans-Dnistria. We may, however, expect to hear of new arrests at any moment.</p>
      <p sl="et">Valentin Besleag spent two weeks in prison because he wished to stand, as provided for in Moldovan legislation, in the local elections that were held at the beginning of June. The authorities in Tiraspol arrested him for importing election brochures from Moldova, as the illegal regime has prohibited the importation of publications of a political nature from abroad.</p>
      <p sl="et">The situation is not improving. The authorities in Trans-Dnistria ignored the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, as mentioned above, which acquitted Tudor Petrov Popa and Andrei Ivantoc three years ago. Both fighters for Moldovan territorial integrity were recently released only because the imprisonment assigned by the illegal regime expired. In addition, the dissidents were prohibited from returning to Trans-Dnistria, so that they are essentially in exile.</p>
      <p sl="et">The European Parliament has repeatedly confirmed its support for the territorial integrity of Moldova. The Trans-Dnistrian regime has no legal basis for existing. The element of cynicism in the situation is all the greater inasmuch as negotiations with a view to solving the conflict were interrupted by the Tiraspol regime more than a year ago.</p>
      <p sl="et">Russia could perhaps convince the regime to return to the negotiating table, but it does not. Moreover, Russian forces are still on Moldovan/Trans-Dnistrian territory, although the Istanbul decision by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe called for the withdrawal of forces by the end of 2002.</p>
      <p sl="et">With the accession of Romania to the European Union, Trans-Dnistria is directly on the border of the European Union. It is no longer appropriate for us to continue to adopt the role of observers. The European Union must participate in the negotiations concerning the Trans-Dnistria conflict as an equal partner and as an active party.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I dream, ladies and gentlemen, of a Thursday afternoon when here, in plenary, against the backdrop of these emergencies, we will no longer have to speak of the suspicious role played by Russia. When it is not Chechnya, it is Transnistria; when it is not Transnistria, it is the disposing of journalists. I believe that we have a big problem on our doorstep, and that problem is Russia, because, on this matter as on so many others, the solution lies with Moscow. Everyone here, in this House, knows this. I believe that the Commission must put its foot down, because these continuous destabilisation attempts that Russia is making to try to regain the power of its Soviet-era empire are no longer acceptable in the third millennium.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This situation has been going on for almost 15 years now. Fifteen years, that is a huge amount of time! That means that there are entire sections of the population of that country that have known only destabilisation and this authoritarian and self-proclaimed regime. I shall not go into all the human rights violations because other speakers have done so, although, like them, I must point out that action absolutely must be taken in the cases of Mr Tudor Petrov-Popa and of Mr Andrei Ivantoc. Having said that, this matter really must be addressed from an overall perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is a frozen conflict. I hate that word, as if a conflict could be frozen, as if a conflict were something cold, languishing somewhere in a cupboard. Men and women are suffering because the law is not being upheld. Let us not forget that Moldova is hardly far away; it is on the edge of the European Union. Talking about Transnistria is just like looking across the street. I genuinely call on the Commission to look at what is taking place across the street.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Bessarabia, cradle of the Republic of Moldova and of the adjacent territories of Ukraine, was a flourishing Europe in miniature, in which Romanians, Ukrainians, Russians and Germans – the family of the incumbent President of the Federal Republic comes from there – as well as Caucasians and many other peoples lived together in peace. This makes it all the more appalling that we are confronted there today with the criminal legacy of the Nazi-Soviet Pact. If that pact had not been made between Hitler and Stalin, that territory would have joined the European Union at the start of this year as part of Romania. We must not forget that, and it means that we have a particular responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">The criminal Stalinist construct known as Transnistria has absolutely nothing to do with what we are seeing in Kosovo. On that count I must take issue for once with my honourable Polish colleague Mr Libicki. Kosovo is a democratic country in which genocide took place, in which the UN and NATO intervened to stop the killing. Comparing that with the situation in the criminal Stalinist construct known as Transnistria is truly a matter of confusing chalk and cheese.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must dissolve that criminal construct in Transnistria, and we must integrate the area into Europe, step by step. That is our historic responsibility. And in particular we must remind Russia that it made certain commitments at the OSCE summit in Istanbul all of eight years ago, not a single one of which has been honoured to this day. We cannot accept this, and we must do some plain talking to our Russian partners who uphold that construct in Transnistria, because without them that criminal construct would have been consigned to history long ago.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Parliament is once again dealing with the issue of human rights in Transnistria. I myself have already spoken on this issue on a number of occasions. This territory is in the centre of what we consider as Europe, the centre of the European continent. There is no freedom of information in this territory. None of the liberal and democratic freedoms which we in the European Union take for granted exist. Russia is involved in the region’s affairs, as it is only thanks to the protection of the Russian state that this bizarre situation, this strange territory, this peculiar power is able to maintain itself. I would like to remind you that, this year, Gazprom took over control of Moldova’s national gas company, Moldova Gas .</p>

În viaţa de zi cu zi a oamenilor de acolo, acest lucru se traduce prin a nu putea să mergi la şcoală, prin a nu putea să-ţi vizitezi mama sau prin a trăi într-o lume controlată cu arma la brâu, în care doar cei care vor să vorbească despre ordine şi libertate intră în închisori, sfârşim prin a fi torturaţi chiar de aşa-zisele autorităţi.

Este nevoie ca Uniunea Europeană să se implice profund în soluţionarea definitivă a conflictului transnistrean în conformitate cu standardele internaţionale.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I have the impression that the strange administrative creations which exist in Transnistria are only there to remind us how little it takes to create a situation where infringements of human rights are viewed as the norm and where the modus operandi is based on a lack of respect for the law and the voice of the international community.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If anyone has forgotten or would like to know what the KGB’s version of model Communism looks like, they should go to the Transnistrian region. In spite of the strong efforts of international organisations, nothing has changed for years. Today, Transnistria is the European, if not the global, centre of the illegal arms trade. Weapons are sold to the most volatile parts of the world. It is also a base for trafficking drugs, women and children, with a total lack of respect for the rights of detainees.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If we do not do our duty and try to change the situation, we may well find that attitudes of which we utterly disapprove win the day. I would like to add an amendment to the resolution on which we will be voting. Mr Tudor Popa is mentioned. He was, we are happy to say, recently released. Both parts of his surname are mentioned in the text, namely Petrov-Popa. He does not wish the Russian part of his name to be used, as it was forced upon him by the self-proclaimed authorities in the Transnistria, and his name should therefore read: Tudor Popa.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, strengthening democracy and the rule of law and ensuring due respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are at the very heart of EU-Moldova relations. These are also key elements of the European Union-Moldova Action Plan endorsed in February 2005.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission monitors closely, on a continuous basis, that these rights and principles are respected by the Moldovan authorities. We discuss these issues regularly and openly with our Moldovan partners and encourage them on every occasion to ensure the full implementation and practice of these key principles for the benefit of Moldovan citizens and European Union-Moldovan relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the situation in the Transnistrian region, this region is de facto not under the control of the government in Chisinau. This is to say that the reforms which have taken place in Moldova have not taken place in the Transnistrian region. This also implies that de facto the European Union-Moldova Action Plan and the European Union’s support for the reform process in Moldova have so far not had a real impact on the situation in the Transnistrian region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in the region regarding democracy, the rule of law and human rights is, therefore, highly problematic. Showing every citizen of Moldova, including those in Transnistria, the benefits of a closer relationship with the European Union, including the implications this has for internal reform and respect for human rights, is an important element of our work. It is a key aspect of our work in the context of the Transnistrian settlement efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is strongly engaged in the Transnistrian settlement efforts with the aim to contribute to the settlement of this frozen conflict. The result of such a settlement must be based on the principles of Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and on the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of these efforts, we try to increasingly involve in our work NGOs and civil society in the Transnistrian region.

Now things have reached stalemate: the parties have hardened their stand. Human rights are being trampled upon, and the independent media and NGOs are under attack.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Vietnam, a word synonymous with catastrophe, is a country that, as we all know, has had an extremely traumatic past, with long and treacherous fighting against colonialism, with a devastating civil conflict and with a calamitous war against the American forces having resulted in unprecedented suffering for the Vietnamese people. Then came the totalitarian Communist regime which, it has to be said, has made at least some proper efforts towards healing the wounds of the past and getting the country on its feet again. Consequently, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was rewarded by the international community in various ways, including being allowed it to join the World Trade Organisation, but, unfortunately, there is still a long way to go to achieving an acceptable level of democracy for the Vietnamese people.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are particularly concerned about new waves of persecution of dissidents and the suppression of the fundamental right of free speech.

Let this motion for a resolution not be seen as a threat, but more as a caution to the Vietnamese Government.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the situation in Vietnam warrants the attention of the international community. The EU needs to send a clear message: discrimination against religious communities, such as the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam, its Protestant congregation and dissident groups, must cease. Members of these communities, who practise their faith peacefully, have suffered detention and home arrest.</p>
      <p sl="fi">That was an extract from a speech I made four years ago in this House on human rights in Vietnam.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before getting to the heart of the matter and talking about the resolution on Vietnam with which we are dealing today, I should like to make a point that I feel is important. I am wondering how the urgent matters with which we deal here, in Parliament, are chosen. Indeed, although I am not calling into question the urgency of the various problems posed in the countries about which we are speaking, it does seem to me that some countries are completely forgotten about when compared with others about which we have the chance to speak several times in one parliamentary term. I shall take just one example – Colombia, with its many trade unionists who have been assassinated and its hostages who are living in increasingly difficult circumstances. According to my research, although Colombia has been the subject of specific resolutions, not once since 2002 has it been an urgent matter; I find this extraordinary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I have taken the floor today to speak about the situation in Vietnam. Although it seems that 2006 was a year of political openness, one that made flexibility possible, it appears that freedom of worship is among the problems being reported to us by the NGOs. It is important that Vietnam accommodates all the religions practised on its territory and permits its entire population to choose its form of worship. Freedom of thought and freedom of speech must not under any circumstances be flouted, and the people of Vietnam, whoever they may be, must be able to express themselves by any means at their disposal, including wide circulation methods such as the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Despite the situation, I should also like to point out – perhaps going against what my fellow Member, Mrs Korhola, just said – that efforts have, all the same, been made in Vietnam. This country has already made certain efforts, of which we have taken note, not least when we went there in 2006 with the ASEAN delegation. It is important that we continue to support this country so that the rights of all its citizens may be respected in full. Let us hope that this resolution helps to achieve this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is another debate on religious persecution and human rights abuses in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia or Laos. Vietnam plays a particularly important role in this region. It enjoys dynamic growth and is overcoming the social and economic abyss that followed the communist period. Unfortunately, increasing wealth does not go hand in hand with respect for human rights, freedom of speech and expression or religious freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Hitherto, in our speeches in the European Parliament, we have all – including myself – focused on the persecution of Buddhists, as this is the largest religious community in Vietnam. Now, however, we are hearing that Catholics, such as the Catholic priest Nguyen Van Ly, are being persecuted. Although I already spoke about this matter in Parliament a year and a half ago, as did Mrs Korhola some eighteen months later, I sadly find myself having to utter virtually the same words.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should expect countries who are members of Asian international organisations, such as ASEAN or ASEM, but also the UN and the High Commissioner for Human Rights to decisively appeal to the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to respect human rights and religious freedoms in that country. Once, when Vietnam was communist and poor, it infringed human rights and suppressed freedom of religion. Now it is doing the same, albeit perhaps on a smaller scale, although it is richer and is supposedly moving away from communist ideology. We cannot remain silent!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in March of this year, fifteen Vietnamese dissidents were sentenced to long terms in prison and house arrest. This event, which has passed without comment in the global media, confirms the poor human rights situation in this country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Basic civil rights, such as freedom of religion, the press and association, are infringed in Vietnam. The right to a fair and proper trial is not respected. Dissidents are placed in psychiatric units in the same way as they used to be in the former Soviet Union. Ethnic minorities are persecuted, priests are oppressed, as are representatives of various faiths.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union cannot, and must not, tolerate these infringements any longer. More importantly, we are Vietnam's most important trading partner. Vietnam benefits from the European Union’s preferential tariff system. We have the resources to make the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam more likely to guarantee the basic civil rights of its citizens. It is our duty to do so.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, after Vietnam’s temporary suspension in 2006 of its policy of repression and restriction of political and civil rights, we are once again witnessing a wave of arrests involving citizens who are considered ‘inconvenient’ by the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The USA recently recognised Vietnam as a partner for stable, normal trade relations. It has also joined the World Trade Organisation. Although the country has opened up economically, it has not relinquished its monopoly on power in favour of a democratic system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to put an end to all forms of repression affecting the members of the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam and its existence needs to be officially recognised. We should call for the release of Vietnamese political prisoners who have been imprisoned because they have legally and peacefully exercised their freedom of opinion, press and religion. The Vietnamese authorities have to comply with the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Council concerning the development of a legal system in the country and respect for basic rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the fact that the European Union is Vietnam’s biggest trading partner, and the aid we offer to this country will amount to 304 million euros between 2007 and 2013, we should consider revising the cooperation treaty which we have already signed, as only economic sanctions can force Vietnam to implement political and institutional reforms which will lead to democracy and a state based on the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today’s debate concerns Vietnam, one of the last remaining Communist countries, where human rights abuses have been taking place for years. In Vietnam, defenders of human rights and democracy are imprisoned, religious leaders are accused of alleged espionage and propaganda against the socialist republic or are viewed as a threat to national security.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Following a period of reduced repression, which was linked to Vietnam’s application for WTO membership, opposition parties have been banned, as have independent media and trade unions. Vietnam enforces preventive censorship, and all media are under party control. Many people who are viewed as political dissidents are placed under house arrest and surveillance. Children and young people are brutally and ruthlessly indoctrinated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, the efforts of international organisations and human rights defenders, as well as the resolutions that have been drawn up, have not led to any change in the situation. We support the resolution and appeal to the Vietnamese authorities to respect human rights, release prisoners and carry out reforms. However, it seems that more radical action will be necessary.</p>

    <intervention id="4-258" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concern about the violation of human rights in Vietnam. This affects, in particular, the exercise of freedom of expression, of association and of religion. However, we must view this in its full context. Vietnam has made considerable progress in terms of economic and social rights. Over the past decade, it has succeeded in lifting a significant part of its population out of absolute poverty and set the country firmly on a course of economic growth, whilst limiting the emergence of socioeconomic disparities within the population.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has been accompanied by some improvements in recent years in the situation as regards civil and political rights. For instance, new legislation relating to religious freedom, which has been adopted in the last three years, has softened some, but not all, of the tools used by the state to control religious organisations and thus allows non-organised groups to seek official recognition.</p>
      <p sl="en">This has already had a positive impact on the ground. Among other things, some Protestant denominations, such as Baptists and Mennonites, which had not been recognised in the past, have been able to register grassroots-level congregations.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, the implementation of the new legislation remains uneven, and progress in the Northern Uplands in particular has been markedly slower than in parts of the Central Highlands and in lowland areas. Moreover, some denominations seen as dissident by the regime, such as the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, and some Hoa Hao and Cao Dai groups, remain illegal and face continued harassment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The climate has also improved for political dissidents in the past two years. A considerable number of high-profile activists were released in 2005 and 2006. Last year also saw the emergence of some new parties and other groupings of activists within the country, which was unprecedented both in terms of the number of groups and of that of their adherents. The official reaction to this development was, initially, relatively low-key. However, this changed in early 2007, and in particular since mid-February. Harassment of dissidents seems to have intensified, and scores of activists were arrested. A number of them have since been tried and sentenced to lengthy jail terms. This includes some well-known persons such as Father Nguyen Van Ly, and lawyers Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong Nhan. We do not know whether this is a temporary reflex or something more deep-seated, but it is of grave concern to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s relations with Vietnam have developed dynamically in recent years, and the Commission has taken every opportunity to press for continued improvement in the human rights situation, especially as regards prisoners of concern. The Commission and EU Member States’ representatives in Hanoi have in particular followed the recent arrests and trials of activists with particular attention. EU diplomats were present at some of the trials as observers, and the EU reacted strongly to their sentencing. In its declaration of 15 May, it reiterated its plea to the Government of Vietnam to release all non-violent political activists exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association. The EU missions in Hanoi have also requested that the Vietnamese Government allow them to visit dissidents in prison, in order to ascertain the conditions of their detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent trials were also raised forcefully by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner in her bilateral meeting with Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Khiem on 28 May 2007, on the margins of the ASEM ministerial meeting in Hamburg. Apart from high-level political contacts, the EU and Vietnam have agreed on mechanisms to conduct a dialogue and exchange of views on human rights issues. A key instrument in this regard is the regular human rights dialogue between the EU missions in Hanoi and the Government of Vietnam. The Sub-Group on Cooperation in the Areas of Institution Building, Administrative Reform, Governance and Human Rights provides another opportunity for the Commission to raise these issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">On all possible occasions, we have expressed our view that the arrest of non-violent political activists is incompatible with Vietnam’s obligations under the international human rights instruments to which it has acceded. Please rest assured that the Commission will continue to use all instruments at its disposal to press the case in question, as well as, more generally, to encourage and support progress on human rights and religious freedom in Vietnam. We also rely very much on the European Parliament to continue to press for the improvement of human rights in Vietnam.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on a point of order, over the last three years of attending these afternoon debates on breaches of human rights, the Commission has always been represented, most usually with a Commissioner, although it is a difficult time. We are very grateful for that. At the same time, I would like it to be noted that, on the Council side, I have never seen a representative. I wonder whether it is because the Council is not invited, or is it because it does not think it is important to be here? Perhaps you could find out and let us know.</p>
