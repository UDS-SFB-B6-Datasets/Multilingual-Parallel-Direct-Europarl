      <p sl="de">Mr President, that is indeed our wish. This is not because the report is a bad one – I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group, too, on a very good report – but there are still one or two critical issues unresolved. We should like to be able to discuss these in peace, which is the reason for our motion; and, as the President has just said, if the House were to agree to it, we could then vote at 11 a.m. – but this is not the reason.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, for form’s sake, I should like to notify my fellow Members on this occasion that I shall also be putting forward a motion – not now, but tomorrow – that the vote on the report on FYROM, or Macedonia, likewise be postponed until the Strasbourg sitting. I shall state the reasons for this tomorrow; I just wanted to let my fellow Members know now. Here, too, there is just one small unresolved issue. This is our group’s wish.</p>

      <p sl="sl">President-in-Office − Ladies and gentlemen, in connection with the situation in Lebanon, diplomatic activities of the European Union and the Member States remain focused on advancing the cause of peace, stability, economic development and respect for human rights in Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We are making efforts to preserve and strengthen the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, unity and stability of Lebanon. The European Union upholds the Lebanese democratic institutions and the legitimate government of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, we are concerned because of the long-term paralysis of the Lebanese institutions. This has been going on since November 2006, and when in November 2007 the President's position became vacant, the paralysis became even more critical.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Apart from being the largest financial donor to Lebanon, the European Union has been making efforts through intensive diplomatic activities also to find a solution for the country's political paralysis.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Within this framework we support the efforts of the United Nations, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League. Thus the European Union upheld the three-part plan, which the foreign ministers of the Arab League unanimously adopted. As is well known, this plan envisages the immediate election of a president, the forming of a government of national unity, and the adoption of a new elections act.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In spite of expressing support for this plan, the Lebanese political parties differ in their interpretation of its execution. There are two main obstacles for the realisation of the proposal. The first one is internal, because the parties cannot reach an agreement regarding their representation in the government, the sharing of ministerial posts, and the new law on elections. The second obstacle is connected with Syria, which refuses to give up its influence in Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In spite of everything, the plan of the Arab League is, at this point in time, still the only initiative which can contribute to the resolution of the political impasse in the country. We expect that the General Secretary of the Arab League, Mr Moussa, will continue with his efforts to resolve the existing situation. In this respect the European Union will provide him with every support.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The recent summit of the Arab League, held in Damascus at the end of March, regretfully did not bring the desired results required for the resolution of the situation. Because of Syria’s interference in the presidential election procedure, Lebanon expressed its protest by not sending their representative to the summit.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In connection with this, I should like to emphasise the commitment of the European Union to the viewpoints set out in a number United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Another demonstration of the European Union’s support of the efforts of the United Nations is its participation in the UN mission in Lebanon. Member States have contributed the largest share of the military force in Lebanon. Despite numerous attacks, during which six members of the Spanish contingent were killed and three Irish soldiers were wounded, the mission has been successful, and in August 2007 it was extended for another year.</p>
      <p sl="sl">European Union Member States also support the establishment of the special United Nations Court for Lebanon in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Also worth mentioning is that in 2007 the EU–Lebanon Action Plan came into effect. This instrument is an upgrading of the existing cooperation within the framework of the Euro–Mediterranean Committee for the Barcelona Process, and activities within this framework have already commenced.</p>

    <intervention id="3-037" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for including Lebanon on today’s agenda. Many other developments in the Middle East – especially events in Gaza – have recently occupied our attention. This should, however, not make us forget the strategic importance of Lebanon for the region and as a partner of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The present situation in Lebanon is extremely worrying. The deep political crisis continues: on 24 March, the parliamentary session to elect a President was postponed for the 17th time since November 2007. The Summit of the Arab League in Damascus has not delivered a solution either.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the security situation has remained relatively calm with no major incidents, public tension and anxiety have increased. Violence could break out at any moment as the political crisis goes on, with unforeseeable consequences for the country and its people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indications that Hizbollah has replenished its military capacity since 2006 are worrying, especially in the light of the recent threats against Israel, following the death of Imad Mugniyeh. Moreover, the protracted crisis is having a very negative impact on the socio-economic situation in Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you are aware, Europe is active at many different levels to help Lebanon: we remain the biggest contributor to UNIFIL, and the European Union has also been the most important donor at the Paris III Conference. We have been firmly supporting the Arab League’s Initiative since it was launched in January 2008 and our Community instruments have allowed us to provide a targeted response to some of the major challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Neighbourhood Policy has developed into a major instrument to support Lebanon’s reform process and to contribute to economic and social stabilisation, even though reform efforts are severely hampered by the current political stalemate.</p>
      <p sl="en">What are our priorities for the immediate future? Continued support for the implementation of the Arab League Initiative remains our key priority. Despite all difficulties, this initiative enjoys broad support and it represents for the moment the only option to find a solution. An important date in the process will be 22 April, when the next presidential election session in the Parliament is scheduled.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea of a special Lebanon Summit within the Arab League framework has recently been floated. If it materialises, we should see how we can best provide support for this initiative. We should note, however, that it is Syria that currently holds the Presidency of the Arab League.</p>
      <p sl="en">A clear and continued commitment to the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions relevant to Lebanon also remains essential, indeed crucial. The publication of the next implementation reports on UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701 – in May and July 2007 respectively – will therefore be essential milestones.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also continue efforts to maintain momentum in the Middle East peace process, which has an impact on Lebanon. I remain in close contact with my Quartet partners and am looking forward to the Middle East conference planned by the European Parliament later this year.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as the representatives of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission have told us, and yesterday the High Representative, Mr Solana, when he appeared before the Committee on External Affairs, the recent Arab League Summit in Damascus did not produce any results, to put it diplomatically.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is now the 17th time that the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, Nabih Berri, has postponed the planned vote to elect the President. This decision has not been taken because of a lack of consensus on the figure of the candidate for the presidency, who, as everyone knows, is a Maronite Christian, nor because of a lack of consensus on the person – the head of the armed forces, Michel Suleiman. This was clear to us as a delegation of MEPs who were in Damascus with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and representatives of Lebanese opposition parties, such as Hezbollah and Amal.</p>
      <p sl="es">The problem, Mr President, comes down purely and simply to the distribution of power; it is about establishing blocking minorities in the Lebanese Council of Ministers and about allocating the positions of head of the secret service and head of the armed forces. This whole situation, as the Commissioner rightly said, seriously affects the credibility, functioning and international image of the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore want the European Parliament to call for the current opposition forces to find a solution, in order to put the higher interests of the country before these internal issues, so that we can continue working, as we did in the EU electoral observation mission promoted by the Commission, towards a sovereign, democratic, free, viable Lebanon that can be constructed in peace.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is renewed talk of war in Lebanon. The political impasse, which has already involved 27 postponements of the convening of Parliament to elect the President of the Republic, could deteriorate, making Lebanon fertile ground once again for inter-Arab conflict and a for now latent source of tension between Iran and Hezbollah and Israel.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Arab League Summit in Damascus failed, as has been mentioned. However, there is feverish external activity on the part of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora, and the Speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri. These two strands of diplomacy that I would say are running in parallel, but until now have not been communicating, represent the dialogue of the deaf that has been dragging on for months between the majority and the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, any attempt to contribute to solving the crisis in Lebanon must necessarily take account of both the internal and the international situation. In fact, all the Lebanese forces have strong links outside the country, some of which are tighter than others. Against this background it will be important to assess the results of the summit taking place today in Sharm el-Sheikh between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It would be useful if an extraordinary meeting of Arab League Ministers could be called as soon as possible, as requested by Prime Minister Siniora, to try to bring Damascus to a position where it respects Lebanon independence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Within this framework, however, I would not leave out an analysis of the truly unique socio-economic situation in that, despite the crisis that followed the war, Lebanon saw its GDP grow by 4% in 2007. However, the social situation is very difficult. A general strike has been called by the trade unions for 7 May, in a bid to raise minimum wages, and according to UN data, one million Lebanese out of a population of four million are living below the poverty line on less than two dollars a day.</p>
      <p sl="it">If we want to help with finding a solution, let us ensure that 22 April is not wasted, not least because 21 August looks like it will be an impossible date to get through. This is the date the candidate for the Presidency has given for his resignation as head of the armed forces because he has reached the age limit. If a solution has not been found by that date, the crisis will spread to the army, as well as bringing an end to the candidacy of General Suleiman for good.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to finish with the words of Prime Minister Siniora: ‘Lebanon cannot be governed from Damascus, but it cannot be governed against Damascus either.’ This seems to me a balanced position, and a benchmark for any initiative by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in almost full agreement with what Mrs Napoletano has just said. I say ‘almost’ because I think that ultimately we need to bear in mind certainly Damascus, certainly other capitals, but in particular the fact that in Lebanon what they are facing, in apparently new forms now, is a policy of systematic assassination of one’s opponents. The more popular they were, the more likely the former communist leader, and all of them, were to be killed in this series of assassinations.</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore can – and must – certainly pay attention to the diplomatic dimension, but unless we remember that in today’s Middle East, as in Europe in 1937, 1938 and 1939, what is being faced is on the one hand an assassination policy and on the other the political reality of victims in the name of freedom, even of enemies, I do not believe we can find the right direction, a direction that can only be given by Europe if it remembers that it was itself delivered from having to renounce national sovereignties, for which reason we have not had wars in Europe in recent years, except in Yugoslavia and elsewhere. That was the imperative, and should also be so in the Middle East: to have something based on freedom and human rights as opposed to the ostracism and blackmail of the dictatorships of the 1930s, and those today in the Middle East and Far East.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, obviously we have limited influence on the situation in Lebanon. It does seem, though, that we have not done all we can to hinder the destabilisation of Lebanon by Hezbollah. This organisation is responsible for terrorist attacks in Lebanon, including the January 2008 attacks, which were aimed at areas under the jurisdiction of UNIFIL. Hezbollah is a private army which, with support from Iran and Syria, is destroying that once flourishing country. For this reason Hezbollah should be added to the European list of terrorist organisations as a matter of urgency. This is the only way we can effectively block its activities among the Islamic public in Europe. This is the only way we can block off the European part of the money that flows to this organisation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is worth taking this opportunity also to recall the scandalous energy contract signed by Switzerland and Iran. Swiss politicians should be left in no doubt that terrorists acting in Lebanon are also benefiting from this money.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Mr President. President Pöttering, I would like to put a specific proposal to you, to propose that various Lebanese parliamentary leaders be invited here to the European Parliament in order to discuss the Arab League’s proposals and to encourage an exercise in parliamentary diplomacy, so that we do not remain impassive in the face of the situation in which the Lebanese people have become pawns in a geopolitical game that is extremely dangerous, both for them and for peace in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="es">This proposal could be carried out in the next few weeks as, given the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, we cannot remain impassive, and Lebanese democracy is one of the weakest links in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot allow the crisis between Iran and the United States and Iran and Israel to turn Lebanon into a battlefield in which every side loses.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to support the Arab League initiative for a commitment to the election of a new President.</p>
      <p sl="es">We cannot let up in our support for the International Court regarding the murder of Rafik Hariri. We are quite concerned about the delay in the investigation, which makes it difficult to protect key witnesses in the case, such as the Syrian Mohammed al-Siddiq, who recently disappeared.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union needs to exert as much pressure as possible so that Syria and Iran cease to hinder the resolution of the political conflict in Lebanon and support the Arab League’s proposal on the election of a new President.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are also concerned about the constant smuggling of weapons into the country to arm an illegal militia. The Lebanese army should have the monopoly on military activity and control its territory.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lebanese people and democratic civil society in that country are the victims of a political crisis decided elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="it">On one side there is the United States, quick to play the Lebanese card against Syria and Hezbollah as part of its pro-Israeli stance to try to stabilise an area devastated by its illegal war against Iraq and to consolidate the military might of the State of Israel. It cannot allow itself to lose Lebanon. On the other side are Iran and Syria and their allied regimes that are playing out their contest for political, military, nuclear and regional supremacy in Lebanon. It does not matter if this means massacre, even the physical massacre, of the Lebanese. They do not want to lose Lebanon either.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union’s role is not to align itself with one or the other in this international chess match. As Europeans we need to do what we can to try to keep Lebanon politically united, by protecting its sovereignty and encouraging dialogue between the government coalition, Hezbollah and General Aoun, starting with the presidential elections. The person elected must be a candidate both parties are happy with. That is Lebanon. The secular, multi-faith nature of the country is a valuable asset for the whole of the international community, and particularly for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, where to start when it comes to breaking the continuing political impasse in Lebanon? The answer is actually too simple for words, and I am convinced that the Council and the Commission are also well aware of this. In any case, my clear answer is: start with the disarmament of Hezbollah. A highly efficient, heavily armed organisation outside the legal authorities’ official means of exercising power is obstructing the normal functioning of the Lebanese state institutions and has so far also blocked a national political compromise.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Simple answers to international crises are often difficult to put into practice. This certainly also applies to the urgent disarmament of Hezbollah; after all, the spectre of renewed civil war is looming. On the other hand, Hezbollah’s continuing position of military power is guaranteeing the continuing influence in domestic affairs of its two great sponsors, Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The consequence of this is obvious: the real threat of a further violent confrontation with neighbouring Israel. Besides, the connection with Tehran’s present hardline nuclear course is evident.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Council and Commission, what solution will Europe supply to this Lebanese dilemma?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have one further brief question. According to reports in today’s US press, a Member State, Bulgaria, is channelling profits from the drugs trade to Hezbollah. I should like the Council to tell me what the situation is. An EU Member State earning money for Hezbollah from the drugs trade – that strikes me as particularly serious.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate gives me great satisfaction. Despite all attempts and initiatives on the part of European bodies, I believe we are acting as though we have abandoned to its fate a people ensnared in successive political crises.</p>
      <p sl="el">Our treatment of the situation is awkward. We seem not to realise that the situation in Lebanon is connected with the challenges in the Middle East and that these challenges are crucial for international security and peace as well as for the EU’s strategic plans in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that the European Parliament should be made to understand clearly that we in the EU must adhere to the commitments made in our partnership with Lebanon. This obliges us to support the legally elected government, which was formed after the last elections in accordance with constitutional requirements, and which today is the target of attacks and threats.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must demonstrate our support through deeds. As Mrs Napoletano has also said, we are not giving enough money, because we are keen on an outcome that resolves the crisis and ends insecurity. Such an outcome requires institutions to function. Parliament has to work as a forum for democratic dialogue and state control; it has to voice the diversity that is an essential part of Lebanon’s identity.</p>
      <p sl="el">A certain parliament is still closed, not just for the election of the President of the Republic, but for all business. If any way is to be found out of the crisis, the President of the Republic needs to be elected immediately and a new government must be formed in accordance with the Constitution. Regional forces competing with each other ought not call the tune, as currently seems to be the case in the presidential election. We must also demonstrate our support for the Lebanese seeking the truth behind political murders. Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets, waving ‘We Want The Truth’ banners.</p>
      <p sl="el">We in the EU must act more effectively and strategically in the region. We must promote responsibilities and genuine interests. We must also find possible resolutions and peace in the states in the area and in the Arab states. There must be understanding and national dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me end on an optimistic note. I believe that the political powers have acted responsibly: events could have led to civil war and a coup, but this did not happen. Let us therefore make the most of these positive elements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairwoman of the delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I am pleased we have a debate on Lebanon on the agenda for this afternoon.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The crisis that this country has been experiencing for several months obviously goes beyond the challenges of a simple presidential election or the formation of a government. We know that it is the very foundations of the political system that are in question, based as they are on the subtle balance between the different religious faiths in the Lebanese patchwork.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is also in question is the place Lebanon hopes to take in the regional arena. Does it want to be an aircraft carrier of the United States and their allies in the region, or the advanced post of a so-called Shi’ite crescent? I do not believe that Lebanon really has to choose between the American camp and the Syrian/Iranian camp. The only viable camp for Lebanon is the camp of Lebanon itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is certainly not for the European Union to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs. Europe does not have to support one coalition over another. What the European Union can do is offer itself as a mediator, help the Lebanese parties to find a minimum of trust in each other - which is essential before any agreement can be reached - and put forward its good offices to launch a process of understanding and compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are right to support the Arab League’s plan based on a triple consensus: one president, one government of national union and the reform of the electoral law guaranteeing fair representation of all the components of Lebanese society. That is the condition sine qua non for the political secularisation that is provided for in the Taif Agreements and that a growing majority of the Lebanese people want to happen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must support every initiative to achieve this. In this regard, the proposal by Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament, which proposes to revive national dialogue, is a positive signal. Just as we have done for many years, we must continue to support a Lebanon that wants to be sovereign, united and at peace with itself at last.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I have the impression that one of the few times that Lebanese members of parliament elected in 2005 have been able to act freely was recently, at the plenary sitting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Athens, because being a Lebanese member of parliament is certainly very dangerous, as events have tragically demonstrated.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that there are some who want us to believe that there is no solution for Lebanon, and therefore that Lebanon is not viable as an independent, sovereign and democratic State. We need to fight against this by supporting the Lebanese institutions, supporting the Arab League’s plan and demanding the removal of any obstacles that are being placed in the way of peace and understanding coming to that country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe has not washed its hands of Lebanon; I would like to remind everyone here of the European military presence in UNIFIL 2, which is an impressive number, and there have been many casualties and deaths, as the Council has reminded us.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our political presence is equal to this military presence. We have limitations, but within those limitations on our capacity, we need to ask the powers outside the region and the Lebanese to reach an agreement, as without them it will be impossible for there to be socio-economic development for the good of the people or peace in the Middle East.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the recent Arab summit was more soap than substance. It failed to resolve the important questions due to the absence of key players.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lebanon’s political crisis and ever-worsening security situation means that the EU must improve the political dialogue and assist a return to the rule of law and democracy. Despite the EU-Lebanon Action Plan having identified effective implementation of Lebanon’s international commitments with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms as a priority, almost no progress has been made. Dysfunctional state institutions and the worsening economy have caused civil disquiet and protests. Even the recent teachers’ strike is toothless without responsive state institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The current political situation undermines the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) reform agenda, but the ENP can be a catalyst for political debate by moving it from power-based discussions towards issue-based discussions. ENP partnership rewards progress. Lebanon is not the best student at learning and cooperating with the ENP, but we cannot allow its adoption as if it were a strategy choice.</p>

      <p sl="sk">As a member of the Euromed/Barcelona Process delegation, I monitor the issue of Lebanon and I regret to say that although Lebanon has a majority parliament, a legitimate majority, this majority is being intimidated and the parliament does not meet at all.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Since the murder of Rafik Hariri, who was well-known and respected, there has not yet been a presidential election and the country as a whole is incapable of finding a political solution to this complicated situation. Members of the Lebanese Parliament whom I met recently, both at the latest Euromed meeting in Athens and here in Brussels, told us how terrible conditions for them are. The feeling in Lebanon is that in practical terms Syria has political power over the country, specifically over southern Lebanon where Hezbollah puts the area in danger on a daily basis by firing rockets into northern Israel. Iran supports the situation and I do not think that this axis is willing to accept democratic changes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to appeal to my colleagues and to all those present, in both the Council and this Parliament, to adopt measures to provide immediate assistance to Lebanon.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to concur with those voices that say that Europe should come up with an initiative now, and ahead of the suggestion from Mrs Patrie, Chair of the delegation, that we should proffer an opportunity for the main Lebanese forces to speak in our Parliamentary forum and tell us what is really blocking the summoning of their Parliament and commencement of the process of electing a President. I believe that a definite policy on Syria is also required. The key to the entire policy on Lebanon lies in Damascus. We cannot separate our policy on Syria from our position on Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If there is currently talk about negotiations between Israel and Syria concerning Israel abandoning the Golan Heights, then one condition must surely be met, which is that Lebanon has the right to be a democratic country, and Syria has to accept that.</p>

      <p sl="sl">President-in-Office . − Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the views of members during the today's debate, and I should first say that there is a considerable consensus, both in the Parliament and in the Council, that it is high time that the stalemate situation in Lebanon is overcome.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The Council has been making efforts in several ways. Some of you, amongst others Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs Napoletano, have emphasised that sending money and financial funds to Lebanon is not enough, and that just electing a president will not be enough either.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This is true. However, in Lebanon and in connection with Lebanon the European Union is doing much more. Here I should like to express gratitude to Carlos Carnero González, who, like myself, in his introductory contribution emphasised the considerable commitment of the European Union in the area of security through its military forces, a commitment which has already cost lives. However, that is not nearly enough. The Presidency of the European Council agrees that it is necessary for the European Union also to play a political role.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At this stage we must not forget that the Arab League initiative, which the European Union supports, is on the table and that the ongoing efforts of the Secretary General, Mr Moussa, deserve to be supported; and the European Union does support them and will continue to support them.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We shall be adapting our actions in connection with Lebanon to suit events as they unfold. I have already mentioned that the presidential election alone will not resolve all the difficulties. A new government will also need to be formed, an electoral reform will be necessary, and, of course, we shall continue to strive for all of this.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The fact is that a resolution of the political crisis would also have an effect on the economic situation in the country. And in making these efforts, the Council and the European Union remain committed to providing support for Lebanon.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This is a country with a huge potential; and that is why we wish to help it and are determined to provide all the assistance that is within our scope, so that Lebanon can achieve political stability and full economic prosperity as soon as possible.</p>

    <intervention id="3-054" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for a very important and responsible debate. I shall report its contents to my colleague, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems to me that we – that is, Parliament, Council and Commission – share the basic view that we will certainly continue to support our long-standing partner, Lebanon, in this very critical phase. Given the complexity of the challenges Lebanon currently faces, it is indeed essential that, as European institutions, we coordinate our efforts as much as possible and take full advantage of our capabilities. The European Parliament has already made valuable contributions to our cooperation with Lebanon in the past. A good example is the European election observation mission at the 2005 parliamentary elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed one of the key tasks ahead is to help Lebanese democracy to become more robust to face challenges like the present crisis. Electoral reform is a crucial element in every initiative that is expected to make a lasting impact on Lebanon’s political system. In this context, the European Parliament, with its particular expertise and know-how, can – and, I trust, will – play a key role.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also true that the conflicts in the region are interlinked, as was underlined by several speakers. As you know, Lebanon and Israel have never reached a peace agreement. Lebanon hosts 400 000 Palestinian refugees partly because Israel and the Palestinians have not yet reached a peace deal. Part of the Hizbollah’s raison d’être is the ongoing occupation by Israel of the Shebaa farms. Therefore, from the point of view of the European Union, a sustained and lasting solution can only be achieved through a comprehensive approach to the peace process. Solving one track of the peace process will help in other areas, but no one track can be secure without progress on others. Certainly, reaching an agreement between Israel and Syria could help to diffuse tensions in Lebanon, and therefore we have thrown our full support behind the current political process. We are hopeful that progress can be extended to other tracks in due course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and the other fellow Members in particular, who have helped in producing a good, very balanced report.</p>
      <p sl="de">My philosophy on this report is as follows. I might perhaps mention a visit I made a few weeks ago to Vukovar – which, as a reminder, is the town where the war was particularly brutal, where hundreds of people were dragged out of the hospital and killed. It is a particularly painful wound for the Croatian population. I have also seen the memorial there and I have talked to the people. The wound goes deep, but no hatred, no rejection of neighbouring Serbia has emerged, but instead an attempt to cooperate anew with the Serbian population there.</p>
      <p sl="de">The mayoress has sat down at the table with the Serbian representative and colleagues from other ethnic groups and together they have represented the interests of the people there. This shows clearly – perhaps more clearly even than the fact that the country’s Deputy Prime Minister comes from Serbia, which is also to be welcomed – how this country has tried passionately to overcome the schisms, conflicts and wars of the past and to create a modern Croatia.</p>
      <p sl="de">All these things, of course, do not resolve the problems that Croatia still has to solve. They do not resolve the issue of the reform of the judiciary or of the public administration, nor do they resolve the issue of the shipping industry – Croatia still has much to do there. Therefore, it is simply not the case that we are ready to conclude the treaties and negotiations – absolutely not. We are, however, on the right track, and that is something that is important for Croatia, but also for the entire region, as the region is also being sent a positive, an important signal with Croatia’s accession: if you fulfil your duties and responsibilities, if you do your homework, then you can become a Member of the European Union. The European Union has to stand by this obligation, and that is something we also make clear in this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to the internal reforms, there are, of course, needs and a few problems, including in relations with the country’s neighbours. I was sad when it was unilaterally decided to introduce the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone. It was not that there were no good, substantial or objective reasons for ecological administration of the fisheries, but it did not make sound sense to take this step unilaterally at the same time as promising Italy and Slovenia that no unilateral steps would be taken before finding a common solution. Now, Croatia has taken that not-so-easy step and the fishing zone has been abolished for the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the European Parliament now believe that the preconditions exist to overcome many of the impasses there have been – I do not want to put up for discussion here whether or not these were justified. Hence my request to Slovenia – Minister Lenarčič is here as a Council representative rather than as a Slovenian minister; he has to wear two hats – as well as to our Slovenian fellow Members in this House, is to help us overcome the bilateral problems. Croatia must, of course, play its own part in this, as we have always said, but if we want to convey the European spirit to the regions or to bilateral relations, we need this help.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hence, also, the proposal in the report – I am saying this now very informally – that a third person or a third institution help to solve this problem. Whether we call it mediation or arbitration or whatever is not the crucial issue. What is crucial is that both countries, Croatia and Slovenia, come together to decide the conditions, and that they accept the judgment to be given by the third institution, by mediation. Things will then be on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="de">The problems in the border area cannot be insoluble. I perfectly appreciate Slovenia’s interest in having access to the sea. This is a perfectly justified concern. I believe that this concern of Slovenia’s is perfectly reconcilable with Croatian interests. This is not insurmountable if we are not deeply and directly involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I wish to state clearly that I should have liked to have been able to conclude negotiations on the part of Croatia in 2008. Unfortunately, this is no longer possible or realistic. I would therefore ask my fellow Members to take a realistic date, 2009, as the date for the completion of negotiations, so that the newly elected Parliament will then be able to give its assent and ratification to take effect.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we all apply ourselves, Croatia can become a Member of the European Union in 2011. This is a fine aim, a good aim. Let us give it our support.</p>

    <intervention id="3-059" speaker_id="4508" name="Erik MEIJER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Netherlands" birth_date="05-12-1944" birth_place="Amsterdam" p_group="Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left" m_state="NL">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, if the seven states of the former Yugoslavia all come to form part of the European Union in future, this will have happened on seven different dates as the result of seven different ‘road maps’. Accession en bloc , before the federation broke up, would probably have been easier for all concerned. Slovenia is now a member, Croatia will follow within the next few years, and the third former Yugoslav republic concerned is Macedonia, which has been awaiting the opening of accession negotiations since back in 2005.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I hope that my subsequent annual report, at the start of 2009, can be all about normal domestic developments in Macedonia, including care for the environment, independence of the media, improvement of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, modernisation of the railways, equality of the various religious denominations, and freedom of negotiation for the trade unions. This will be possible if the two problems leading to discord that are attracting the most attention are solved definitively. We have not yet reached that point.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Relations between the two major language communities have improved greatly since the major conflict of 2001. The Ohrid Framework Agreement that followed, and in particular the agreement on qualified parliamentary majorities and administrative decentralisation, has made an important contribution to improving mutual relations – which are not yet free of conflict, however – resulting in a temporary parliamentary boycott and a short-lived governmental crisis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is in everyone’s interests that the problems underlying this be solved as quickly as possible. In a multiethnic state, the complete equality of status of regional languages, including in administrative communication at national level, is an essential symbol of the complete equality of all inhabitants. Macedonia can learn from more than a century of linguistic conflict in another bilingual state, Belgium, that delaying this inevitable outcome just leads to unnecessary tension. The desire for everyone to be able to use the Albanian language everywhere must be taken seriously.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, the issue that, at the preparatory stage, not only the rapporteur but also all the shadow rapporteurs believed had to be resolved quickly, is still receiving the most attention. We all refuse to side with either of the conflicting viewpoints of the two neighbouring countries regarding the significance of the name ‘Macedonia’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To the candidate country, looking back over more than a century, Macedonia has been, successively, the name of a resistance movement against the Ottoman Empire, of a Yugoslavian federal state, and of an independent country. To its southern neighbour, Greece, Macedonia is an important part of its own long history and the name of the region around the Greek city of Thessaloniki.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Greece has invested a large amount of capital in its northern neighbour and is the most emphatic supporter of the country’s accession to the European Union. It is an important step forward that Greece has abandoned its attempts to replace the name ‘Macedonia’ for its northern neighbour with ‘FYROM’, a term completely incomprehensible to everyone, in favour of emphasising that this state does not cover the whole of historical Macedonia, but only the Slav and Albanian northern part.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have always opposed the view that a state – particularly one formerly under Communist rule – must become a member of NATO before it can be admitted to the European Union. In Macedonia’s case, the refusal on 2 April to admit this country to NATO does affect its chances of joining the EU in the near future. Each Member State has the opportunity to block any newcomer, even if it would like to admit this newcomer if there were not a difference of opinion on one sensitive detail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, section 37 is central to this debate. In this connection, and in agreement with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I tabled a compromise amendment this morning. I await the reactions to this before my second turn.</p>

    <intervention id="3-060" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Lenarčič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sl">President-in-Office − To begin with, I should like to congratulate Mr Swoboda and Mr Meijer for preparing the two reports on the progress achieved by Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We are glad that the European Parliament has placed the discussion on the progress achieved by both the candidate states on the agenda of this session. This is because the Slovenian Presidency attaches exceptional importance to integrating the states of the Western Balkans into the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In this connection, I should like to remind you that at their informal meeting at the end of March the foreign ministers communicated to the region of the Western Balkans a positive message concerning its European prospects. At this difficult time for the region, in my opinion, such a message is welcome and appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Firstly, as regards Croatia: the accession negotiations with Croatia are proceeding according to plan and at this point I would like to express my agreement with Mr Swoboda’s view that, over the last two years, Croatia has made substantial progress in meeting the accession benchmarks.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Sixteen out of 35 negotiation chapters have been opened so far, and two have already been provisionally closed. Two accession conferences with Croatia are scheduled, one in April and another in June; and provided that all the benchmarks are met, several other new chapters will also be opened at the two accession conferences.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I should like to emphasise that the Slovenian Presidency is committed to continuing the process of expansion of the European Union and achieving further progress in negotiations. The dynamics of negotiations depend primarily on the candidate state itself, and on its progress as regards the meeting of the benchmarks. These have been determined within the negotiations framework, in the revised accession partnership which the Council of the European Union adopted in February this year, as well as in other legal acts.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I repeat, Croatia has achieved considerable progress; however, the fact is that a lot of work remains to be done. As was stated by Mr Swoboda, in the future much more attention should be paid to further transfers and effective implementation of the acquis communautaire . Croatia must continue its efforts to meet the benchmarks and achieve faster progress.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In particular, I would like to mention the following: the reform of the judiciary and administration, the fight against corruption, economic reforms, minority rights, the refugees' return, and full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The documents I have mentioned also consider it essential for Croatia to continue making efforts to achieve good relations with neighbouring countries. Of course this includes finding solutions for the unresolved issues.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I should like to move on to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: as Mr Meijer stated in his report, this is the only country with candidate status since 2005 which has not yet commenced the accession negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In our opinion, once the benchmarks are met, this situation should be finally resolved this year. That is why the message conveyed in the European Commission's latest document was that the autumn report on progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could be positive, provided the key priority tasks are fulfilled. And a similar message was also communicated at the foreign ministers’ informal meeting in Slovenia at the end of March.</p>
      <p sl="sl">At the same time, we must not forget that the country has already proved its importance for stability in the region. The country's role must be recognised, and it must be encouraged with positive signals to continue its constructive role in the region, and to continue with its reforms. One such signal is the dialogue on visa liberalisation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We concur with Mr Meijer's opinion that the government in Skopje has been implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, especially in the sphere of decentralisation and the level of ethnic minorities' representation in the public administration. Our wish is that progress be made as soon as possible in finding solutions for the remaining issues, which are crucial for the Albanian community.</p>
      <p sl="sl">As the country presiding over the EU Council, Slovenia has been encouraging all the political parties to step up their political dialogue and systematic cooperation, so that the next stage in the process of joining the European Union can be achieved this year.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In this context, I should like to emphasise how sorry we are that, because of the open issue of the name, the latest negotiations have failed to bring the desired results. Also, I regret that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has not been invited to become a NATO member. Considering that the country has made considerable efforts to secure this invitation, we hope that it will soon follow in the footsteps of the other two candidates, who have each received such an invitation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In its statement, following the NATO summit, the Slovenian Presidency has called for the negotiations on the name issue to be continued, and to be concluded as soon as possible. The Slovenian Presidency also called for all the politicians in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to preserve the achieved level of unanimity as regards their country's European and Euro-Atlantic future. The Slovenian Presidency has also recommended that the country should take full advantage of the time that is still available before the Commission produces its regular autumn progress report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome Mr Swoboda’s report on Croatia and Mr Meijer’s report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Croatia, I find that the Swoboda report addresses the main issues where Croatia will face challenges on its path to the European Union, focusing particularly on the political sphere. It is a solid report that will reflect realities even better if Amendments 15 and 16 by the rapporteur are adopted, for instance concerning the timetable of the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">Croatia’s accession negotiations have generally been going well, although they have been affected by the application of the ecological and fisheries protection zone – the famous, or infamous, ZERP issue. I welcome the recent decision of the Sabor, the Croatian Parliament, to suspend the application of all aspects of the ZERP for EU vessels, in line with Croatia’s earlier commitments. I commend Prime Minister Sanader for his leadership and I also thank Commission President Barroso for his personal involvement in settling the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I visited Zagreb in early March and found that Croatia’s European vocation was strong enough to settle this problem if it was hampering the accession negotiations. The removal of this obstacle by Croatia should allow chapters that have been blocked to be unblocked as of now and negotiations to resume again at normal pace, allowing for substantial progress in the remaining months of the Slovenian Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do agree with the rapporteur and with Mr Lenarčič that Croatia has much work ahead. Concrete progress is needed in judicial, administrative and economic reforms, in the fight against corruption and on refugee return and minority rights. Croatia will also need to continue to make progress on various open bilateral issues with its neighbours. This year could be a decisive one in the accession negotiations, provided that a number of conditions are met by Croatia. The Commission is ready to present in this autumn’s enlargement package an indicative timetable, or a conditional road map, for the technical conclusion of the accession negotiations in the course of 2009, preferably even during the mandate of the present Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">To achieve this, Croatia needs to deliver on all opening benchmarks by June. There is not much time to waste. It will also need to comply with all obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and ensure urgent and significant improvements in the management of the EU’s financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is ready to process negotiating positions in the various chapters once benchmarks are met. Essentially, the ball is now in Croatia’s court. The sooner concrete results are achieved, the sooner Croatia will join the European Union. I fully agree with Mr Swoboda that Croatia can become a leading benchmark for the Western Balkan countries showing how they can realise their European perspective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I can by and large share the assessment of the Meijer report regarding the reform process. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation with the Commission services on the report. Following the granting of candidate status in 2005, there was a slowdown. However, the Commission’s rather critical progress report of November 2007 has been followed by corrective actions. Important reforms have been adopted since then, especially to strengthen the judiciary, reform the police and improve inter-ethnic relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note the recommendation that the Commission should develop a set of benchmarks for the opening of accession negotiations this year. I would like to inform you that we have established eight benchmarks, derived from the key priorities of the new Accession Partnership. A recommendation to start accession negotiations will depend upon the progress which the country has made in meeting these benchmarks. We shall make our assessment in the coming autumn in the enlargement package, which will most likely be presented in early November.</p>
      <p sl="en">Evidently, political stability will be essential for success. I met President Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Gruevski in Skopje some weeks ago, in March. I called upon all political forces in the country to concentrate their energies on the reform agenda in order to take advantage of the opportunities which this year holds for the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">I repeat this call today, as it is no less important now, in the aftermath of the NATO summit in Bucharest. The name issue has consumed much political energy lately. While I congratulate Croatia and Albania on their success in Euro-Atlantic integration with NATO membership, I can understand the disappointment felt in Bucharest last week by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I encourage the political leadership to continue on the road towards NATO and EU integration with full determination.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by noting that we are discussing developments in the two countries at a very appropriate point in time. Both countries are in a position to make this year a very special and even decisive one in terms of getting more and more integrated with the European Union. Support and encouragement from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be highly important for these countries. Therefore, I very much appreciate your invaluable contribution to our European policy of stability and progress in the Western Balkans.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we are talking today about the only two clearly European candidate countries we have, namely Croatia and Macedonia. We hope to be able to conclude the negotiations with Croatia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest. We hope to be able to begin negotiations with Macedonia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest. We want to prevent both countries becoming hostages to bilateral problems, and I appeal in particular to our Greek fellow Members to show movement on this issue, as the erroneous decision taken in Bucharest is already starting to destabilise Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards Croatia, the Sanader government has been actively pressing ahead with reforms and negotiations. I appeal to the Council and Commission to keep up with the pace of work. I appeal to the Commission actively to strengthen its capacities and to process the relevant documents quickly. I appeal to the Council to open all the negotiating chapters as quickly as possible. When they are closed naturally depends on the negotiations and on Croatia’s efforts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Croatia has done a massive amount of preliminary political work. It has settled and resolved the issue of fishing zones with great courage, it has endorsed arbitration with Slovenia, and it has above all sent a signal of great significance to the entire region by appointing a Serbian Deputy Prime Minister to the Sanader government, and this in the light of the situation Mr Swoboda has rightly described in Vukovar, for example. Protection of the rights of minorities that goes way beyond what most Member States guarantee in terms of minority rights is taking place there.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should therefore like to say that we should acknowledge Croatia’s political achievements and decisively support the country on its way into the European Union. We are abiding by the ambitious aim to take a decision in the current period. Should this not be possible, it will be the autumn. We would support your motion, Mr Swoboda, if it contained ‘latest’ and ‘should’, but ‘could’ is only a status report, and we shall therefore keep up the pressure on the Council and Commission. We know that this is ambitious, but Croatia deserves to see justice at long last.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to make a couple of comments on both reports on behalf of my group and myself. To begin with, compliments to my colleague Mr Swoboda, who has succeeded this year, too, in presenting us with another balanced report. When we talk about Croatia, we are talking about the final steps that the country has to take to enable the conclusion of negotiations. Hopefully these final steps will take the form of a final sprint.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The gaps ascertained by the Commission must be filled. We hope that this can be done apace, even though, as is always the case at the end of negotiations, the dossiers concerned are difficult ones, for example the dossier on shipbuilding. I would appeal to everyone, including the Government of Croatia, to reach the necessary political consensus within the country, too, so that even the difficult decisions can be taken quickly. I also concur with Mr Swoboda’s words about the dates by which all of this, particularly the conclusion of negotiations, can take place.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Regarding FYROM – Macedonia – it is important, as the Commissioner has already said, that the country endeavour to reach the Commission’s benchmarks this year, so that a decision can be taken on the start of negotiations. I believe this to be fundamental. It is true of Macedonia, too, that a consensus must be reached in the country itself; I am very concerned in this regard about recent problems with the Albanian minority and the vote being held in Skopje tomorrow or the day after, which may lead to the fall of the government. If this were to happen, the country would be at sea, as there could be no negotiations with Greece over the name or any work on the benchmarks to which the Commissioner referred. I think that it is important to appeal to everyone in that country to ensure that the consensus holds and to prevent us being faced with a situation of new elections in the next few weeks; it is important to invest in this consensus.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we, too, think it a shame that no consensus could be reached in Bucharest on Macedonia’s accession to NATO. In our opinion, another attempt must be made, based on mediation by the UN and Mr Nimitz, and I hope that both sides invest in a somewhat more productive atmosphere, so that a solution can be found quickly.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, earlier this year the accession negotiations with Croatia slowed down and the process seemed to have come to a standstill. Let us hope that this is now over, and the negotiations will pick up momentum once more. The Croatian Parliament’s decision to suspend the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone that had been applied to European Union Member States has certainly helped in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In recent years Croatia has achieved a great deal that warrants recognition: there can be no denying that it is a functioning democracy; it has a functioning market economy and is implementing the provisions set out in the Stability and Association Agreement. At the same time, however, there are undeniably serious problems that also need to be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The first of these I would like to mention is procrastination over the reform of the judicial system – this cannot be delayed any longer. I believe it is important to strengthen the fight against corruption, and ensure that it extends not only to more minor cases, but also to the ‘big players’, as Croatia has not made much progress so far in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Improvements need to be made as regards efficient use of Community resources, and major structural reforms must be initiated. In this context I would like to highlight the situation and role of the shipbuilding industry, which is in need of restructuring. If Croatia manages to do all this, then it really ought to be able to conclude the negotiations in time, within the deadline set in the report, and must be given every possible support to do so.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Croatia’s accession process has a regional significance reaching far beyond the process itself. If Croatia’s accession is successful, it represents a model and an incentive for the other Western Balkan countries too. Prompt and successful conclusion of the negotiations is therefore not only the joint responsibility of Croatia and the European Union, but also in their common interests. I hope that Croatia will assume this responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Last, I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda on the outstanding job he has done in carrying out his duties as rapporteur. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Naturally I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur. This is a very good report. It is a very good thing that Croatia and Macedonia may obtain membership of the Union before the 2009 European elections. In respect of the latter we must clearly avoid adding political conditions for accession, especially in spheres that, like property rights or indemnity claims, belong to the sphere of bilateral relations. The process of enlargement cannot be allowed to be hostage to such tensions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is also a broader context to this process. Enlargement of the Union into the Western Balkans is a European contribution to stabilisation of this region – a region in which we failed in the 1990s. For this process to be completed, we must also send a positive signal to Belgrade. By recognising Kosovo, we have placed the pro-European section of public opinion in Serbia in a very awkward position. We are left with little time to go even part of the way towards balancing out that impression.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A road map for a visa agreement with Serbia is needed. We should sign a stabilisation and association agreement as a matter of great urgency. Today this agreement has become hostage to the internal policy of two Member States, but the whole Union may have to pay the price of stopping it.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am delighted with this very good, balanced report by Mr Swoboda, which is a positive sign for Croatia and for the region as a whole. Despite all the tangible efforts, however, we must not forget certain problem areas that still require comprehensive reforms before Croatia is able to join the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ultimately, the facts are the only reliable benchmark for a country’s readiness for accession. Examples are the clarification of unresolved border issues, the fight against corruption, administrative reform and respect for human rights. Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is another benchmark for the country’s readiness.</p>
      <p sl="de">The political parties, civil society and the media must make longer-term efforts to gain the support of the population. The same applies to the integration of national and sexual minorities into social and political life.</p>
      <p sl="de">I very much welcome the decision to appoint a representative of the Serb minority as Deputy Prime Minister. A great deal still has to be done in the environmental protection sector, however, in order to ensure ecologically sustainable development in line with EU targets. Supporting Croatia in this is a task I shall be glad to promote.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, will not vote for the enlargement of the EU to take in FYROM and Croatia. We oppose the strengthening of a capitalist and war mongering EU.</p>
      <p sl="el">Following the dismemberment of Yugoslavia by ΝΑΤΟ and the EU, imperialist plans are being hatched to shift borders in the Balkans and create protectorates buttressing imperialists and dividing peoples. The largest US base in Europe is being formed and expanded on arbitrarily marked-out territories between FYROM and the Serbian province of Kosovo, where EU forces are expected to arrive. This typifies the intensification of rivalries in the region.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the recent NATO summit, Albania and Croatia were allowed to join, but FYROM was not invited to do so. This demonstrates the unpleasant blackmail being applied to the Balkan states, as well as Greece, to subjugate them to imperialist interests. With regard to the name, we support a geographically defined solution acceptable to all and far removed from divisive nationalism and enslavement, for peace, stable borders and the protection of the sovereignty of states. What we need is a common struggle by the people against the imperialist organisations that divide and exploit it.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the reverberations from the NATO summit in Bucharest have reached this Parliament. It is comforting that Europe has at last taken a position on an issue concerning it, as there is usually little enthusiasm to take a position when others are making decisions. I therefore, think that all parties have learnt a useful lesson especially the FYROM. This new republic has not yet learnt European diplomatic practice, having placed its hopes on accession to ΝΑΤΟ simply because of US promises and infantile, misguided hopes of liberation from bondage.</p>
      <p sl="el">In negotiations between European states provocation and fanaticism should never be an option. Choices should not be made on the imaginary basis of ancestry, neighbouring cultures and history; instead, we should act in a spirit of consensus, comprehension and, above all, probity in order to find a solution rather than worsen problems. A positive approach will benefit FYROM, which we hope will be helped to join both ΝΑΤΟ and the EU. If FYROM refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal, it will find that there are obstacles to its accession, because it has undermined its own efforts. If its efforts are undermined now, perhaps its future will also be undermined.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Surely, Mr. Meijer is aware that ‘Macedonia’ and ‘Macedonian nation’ are terms created by a directive of the Communist International in 1934. After the war, the ideas of Macedonism were taken on board and imposed with an iron fist by the Yugoslav Communist Party and later became part of the idea of Great Serbia. These ideas include a vehement propaganda of Bulgaro-phobia.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Many people in Macedonia who are aware of their Bulgarian ethnic identity are being persecuted because of their desire to call themselves Bulgarians. Each year in Skopje, the memorial plaque of the Bulgarian woman Mara Bouneva, a fighter for Macedonia’s freedom, whom the French press named ‘Macedonia’s Charlotte Corday’, is desecrated. In 2007 this desecration was accompanied by a physical assault on Bulgarians and on Macedonian citizens identifying themselves as ethnic Bulgarians.</p>
      <p sl="bg">It is high time the Macedonian government put such manifestation of hatred against Bulgarians under restraint because such manifestations of hatred do not belong in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you, Mr President. The report is good throughout. It is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in Macedonia; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done. But, as so often before, the debate is reduced to discussing our various views of the dispute over the country’s name rather than working out how we can get Macedonia into the EU as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We all know what happened at the summit in Bucharest. I will not go into who was right or wrong or who had greater national interests to defend, but I have to say that foreign policy is not just a matter of who is right and who is wrong. Foreign policy is about getting solutions which best serve peace and security in one’s own country or region and, in our case, Europe. This is achieved by a mixture of goodwill, compromise, good diplomacy and clear leadership. To prevent a country in southern Europe from becoming a member of NATO when the possibility arose is, to my mind, not a particularly wise move, given the complexity of the situation in the Balkans right now and all the challenges we face: independence in Kosovo, which is a fait accompli , the departure of the government and new elections in Serbia and still-ongoing police reforms in Bosnia.</p>
      <p sl="sv">But to block the EU membership of a Balkan country, or even just to think of doing so, is not just unwise but downright dangerous! Only three hours ago I spoke with a colleague here in the European Parliament who said: ‘If they don’t do as we want, we can block them, not just in NATO, but in the EU. The law entitles us to do so’.</p>
      <p sl="sv">My reaction is to say: then we must change the law! Surely laws are not there for us to block, disrupt or blackmail one another? Surely they are there so that we can all get along together as best we can in a peaceful and secure Europe?</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is my firm opinion that, the sooner all the Balkan countries are in the EU, the sooner we shall have a secure Europe. There is absolutely no doubt that Macedonia belongs to Europe and that Macedonia should be brought into the EU as quickly as possible. I urge you to support the report.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Although my wish is that Croatia should, in any event, join the European Union as soon as possible, I would like to warn this House, and especially the rapporteur, my friend Hannes Swoboda, that the unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia in respect of its borders with neighbouring countries are not an exception but a rule.</p>
      <p sl="sl">What is exceptional in this matter is only that, for once, Croatia has had to withdraw its unilateral action due to being faced with a choice: either the European Union, or a nationalistic isolation.</p>
      <p sl="sl">And it is here that this pressure has proven to be useful, and I hope that Mr Swoboda and also the European Commission and the Presidency will continue to insist on the policy that unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia regarding the determination of frontiers with neighbouring countries shall not be rewarded.</p>

      <p sl="sl">The best way of stabilising this part of the Balkans is for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to make progress and move closer to the European Union. Its successful negotiations will help all other neighbouring countries to make additional efforts to gain candidate status.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In order to overcome the dispute over the name, external initiatives are required. Symbolic gestures are necessary both in Skopje and Athens, as well as perseverance. Now is the right time to look for a less provocative name for Skopje Airport, and to condemn the disrespectful treatment of the Greek flag. However, any further difficulties and the discrimination which holders of Macedonian passports are subjected to in connection with Greek visas are also unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In the European Union, we are building a community of modern post-national states. Mutual respect of differences and national identities is also an issue of respect for fundamental human rights. Only in this way can we prevent, or at least limit any negative consequences of the feeling that one's nationality is threatened. We need to abolish the visa regime for all the countries in this region. However, also required is a rapid and permanent solution for the country's name and a comprehensive alliance between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece. Peace and stability, and fast and successful Euro–Atlantic integrations are in the interest of both the states and all the nations.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Nevertheless, Commissioner, and Mr Lenarčič, the Slovenian Presidency ought to table the Macedonian question for the next summit. There is no need whatsoever to wait until autumn.</p>
      <p sl="sl">And one more thing about Croatia: by implementing the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, Croatian politics was hoisted by its own petard. In the future such surprises will not be possible.</p>
      <p sl="sl">If this adventure has taught us something so be it, but if they have not learnt anything, then all the words and vows about finalising negotiations in 2009 is just dust in the eyes. No one needs dust in their eyes: not the citizens, nor the economy, nor the neighbouring countries, nor the European Union. What we now need is a success story. However, for any success the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is a necessity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in making a constructive assessment of Croatia’s progress, the European Union should not only set conditions, but also offer all possible assistance, bearing in mind the experience of other European states, the specifics of the region and the fresh memories of war that remain with the people of this country. Integration of the Balkan Peninsula without Croatia is not feasible. It should also be stressed that the last two years of cooperation have brought unexpectedly good results, and this undoubtedly bodes well for the process of integration with the European Union. Obviously there are certain areas where more resolute action is needed. In my view, however, the efforts made by this state should be given their due, and the whole of the EU should support such action. Over the last two years Croatia has made laudable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would consequently express the conviction and the hope that with mutual engagement and suitable support from other Member States, negotiations will be successfully completed in time for the accession treaty to be finalised before the European Parliament elections in June 2009.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a warm welcome to our counterparts from Macedonia who are following this debate. Commissioner Rehn has said that we are encouraging Macedonia to move forward in the reform process. ‘Yes,’ we all say in unison, ‘we want negotiations to be opened this year.’</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we still need to name names. The party who has put paid to Macedonia’s ability to enter into alliance commitments is Greece, with its veto against the country’s membership of NATO. There is admittedly a naming dispute, but we cannot ignore the fact that, in 1995, Greece made a binding statement, valid under international law, agreeing that the naming dispute would never be an obstacle to Macedonia joining the international community, the EU or NATO.</p>
      <p sl="de">Greece has broken this internationally binding agreement, and if we want to impose reforms in this regard, I say that Greece is in breach of European criteria and not Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a step backwards, it is a slap in the face of a small state that is really making every effort to go along with us and open negotiations. I would also say, therefore, Mr Swoboda, that the sleight of hand to stop, or postpone, tomorrow’s vote again further risks destabilising the government in Macedonia, encouraging as it does the nationalistic forces.</p>
      <p sl="de">The actual problem is that with Greece we have an allied country that refuses point blank to recognise any kind of minority in its own country. This is contrary to the Copenhagen criteria, which is embarrassing to the European Union and to the alliance. I wish Macedonia every strength as it takes the next few steps in spite of Greece.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, not only is Croatia culturally and historically anchored in Central Europe, but also it already meets all the accession criteria. Therefore, we should not be putting any unnecessary obstacles in its way. With the settlement of the fisheries dispute, Croatia has once more affirmed its readiness for EU membership, and the Croatian Government is also strengthening its efforts to combat corruption.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, Croatia’s rapid admission, which has now come within its grasp, should not in my view lead to automatic entry for any other states. As is generally known, Macedonia is having to battle with not only corruption, but also economic problems and the rule of law. Particularly with regard to Kosovo’s declaration of independence, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic peace with the Albanian minority can continue in the long term. We must not repeat the mistakes of past enlargement rounds. The EU must in my view finally wake up to the fact that unresolved conflicts, cultural differences and socioeconomic problems do not vanish into thin air with accession.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Mr President. As chairman of the Croatia-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee, I feel that recent months have brought a favourable turn of events in Croatia’s Euro-Atlantic integration process. A few weeks ago, Mr Barroso outlined the road map for concluding accession negotiations by autumn 2009, and last week Croatia received an invitation to join NATO.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Both of these developments are an acknowledgement that Croatia is on the right track, and the international community is rewarding the efforts of the Croatian government. It is no coincidence that the Eurobarometer result in Croatia has risen above 60% again for the first time in a long time. I also think it was a remarkable and wise attitude that led to our Croatian friends’ decision not to enforce the fishing protection zone in the case of European Union Member States in the interests of Croatia’s membership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the issue of Kosovo’s independence, the government of Mr Sanader has likewise pursued a moderate course by aligning itself with the majority of EU Member States and recognising Kosovo’s independence.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the fact that the Croatian Serb minority has been given the post of deputy prime minister in the current cabinet has contributed greatly – as others have already said – to stability in the region and peace among the different ethnic groups. I believe it is unfair on the part of the Slovenian Prime Minister to announce that he would not rule out vetoing Croatia’s accession to the EU because of the border issue between the two countries. EU enlargement and the fate of a nation must not be tied to resolving a bilateral dispute over borders.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The report carries a positive message in that it recognises the progress made by Croatia as regards stability in the Western Balkan region, as regards ensuring the country’s economy is ready to compete in the European Union context, and as regards institutional reforms and adoption of European Union legislation. Alongside the positive points, however, the report does not shrink from mentioning the challenges that face us: reforming the judicial system, combating organised crime and corruption, bringing refugee returns to a conclusion, and resolving or alleviating bilateral tensions. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Erik Meijer on their 2007 progress reports on Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively. Both reports are excellent. As a Socialist Group shadow for the report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I would like to thank Mr Meijer for his serious and honest cooperation during the making of this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia hails the achievements in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which deals with the political aspect of inter-ethnic relations. The report comments on economic performance, the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors, and progress in the fight against corruption. On the negative side, we regret the signing of the Bilateral Immunity Agreement by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the United States, which grants exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in contradiction of EU standards and policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report calls on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece to increase efforts to overcome the dispute on the name of the country. That should in no circumstances become an obstacle to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s membership of international organisations. On the name issue, the report does not criticise either of the two sides. It only encourages both sides to carry on negotiations, despite what happened at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last week. Fortunately Javier Solana said yesterday in the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee that negotiations on the name will continue. If the two sides agree, NATO can take a decision to invite the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia immediately, even at ambassador level, so a new summit will be needed. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could get a date for the start of accession negotiations this year. The European Parliament should give a clear lead for the country towards European integration.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, when we talk about the Balkans, we have to look at the region as a unified whole. The EU’s long-term objective is the accession of all Balkan countries. For this objective to be achieved, results are also expected on the part of the countries themselves. A common European future is the joint task of the Member States and all the Balkan countries. We Nordic countries are no stranger to historical conflicts, but are now working together. The Balkans, like the Nordic region, are bound together by a common history, common languages and a common culture throughout their length and breadth. It should be possible, therefore, to launch a process of cooperation to ensure peace and stability.</p>
      <p sl="da">At present, there are a number of cooperation agreements between countries in the region. Why not go one step further? Taking inspiration from Nordic cooperation, the Balkan countries could establish a cooperation forum along the lines of the Nordic Council or the Baltic Council. Intensifying the existing regional political cooperation in the form of a Balkan Council will enable these countries to enter into practical, forward-looking cooperation, which will offer an opportunity to stabilise the region and make those countries that are not yet Member States or official candidate countries more prepared for accession.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Croatia, that old European nation with a long history and an interesting culture, should be brought into the European family of nations known as the European Union as soon as possible. Croatia, a country applying to join the Union, paradoxically has a longer history than some of the founding states of the European Community, such as Belgium and Luxembourg. Zagreb and Split are very European places, while Dubrovnik is a jewel in Europe’s cultural crown. During this debate, most of the speakers, including myself, have spoken wearing ties. It is worth remembering that ties were invented by the Croats and it should also be emphasised here in the European Parliament, which so values liberty and freedom, that the Croatian port of Dubrovnik was the first in Europe to prohibit trading in slaves at the beginning of the 15th century.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Given this situation, we do not even have a moral right to hold back Croatia’s access to the Union.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Meijer report and the unanimous resolutions of the EU-Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee both emphasise the three vital steps FYROM has taken towards Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first step, of course involves meeting accession requirements and complying with the acquis communautaire . Although FYROM has made progress, it must continue its journey of reform as stressed both in the Meijer report and in various other reports by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second step concerns internal policies and social cohesion. It must continue to abide by the Ohrid Agreement, especially as far as the Albanians and also other minorities in this multi-ethnic country are concerned.</p>
      <p sl="el">The third step is resolving the differences between FYROM and its neighbours in accordance with the Salzburg Declaration. Let me stress here that Greece was – and continues to be – at the forefront of endeavours to achieve the accession of all the Balkan states to Euro-Atlantic structures, since it firmly believes that the development of the countries in the region will benefit all.</p>
      <p sl="el">For Greece, however, the name issue is not simply a historical, psychological or emotional problem. It is a genuine political issue for all Greek citizens, as it concerns the European values of good neighbourliness and regional cooperation. May I remind you that Greece agreed to FYROM being awarded the status of accession candidate subject, of course, to the proviso in COM(2007)663 that a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue be found through negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should point out that even after the postponement in Bucharest of an invitation to FYROM to join NATO pending the resolution of the name issue, Greece is in favour of continued negotiations. In fact, it has taken the generous compromise step of suggesting an acceptable composite name, so all that remains for the other side to do is to meet Greece halfway.</p>
      <p sl="el">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to believe that compromises will be reached regarding the few points still to be clarified, enabling us to go ahead with the vote in Strasbourg.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Croatia has a European vocation: the recent invitation to join NATO and the current negotiations to join the EU are a testimony to that. This is quite an achievement for a country which only a decade ago was practically at war. Equally, however, that is not enough to eliminate the challenges still facing both Croatia and the EU on the way to completing those negotiations. The timetable is extremely tight; practically each day counts, irrespective of the different dates advanced for the finalisation of the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, when I visited Zagreb some time ago at the head of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I took note of the determination of the Croatian authorities to do away with those problems and achieve membership of the Union. In this respect, the recent decision of the Croatian Parliament to exempt the EU states from the application of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP) following Commissioner Rehn’s visit, is both a testimony to that determination and is an important step in the right direction. I am convinced that, with the right administrative capacity to implement the required legislation, Croatia, in both the EU and NATO, will be a solid factor of stability and progress in an area that still needs our full attention. I congratulate Mr Swoboda on all his work reflected in this report.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you, Madam President. Croatia plays a key role in the democratic development of the Western Balkans, and it is immensely important that the process should continue. We saw that, for understandable reasons, it slowed down somewhat during the Croatian election campaign and the formation of a new government, but now I really hope that the process will put on some speed. As previous speakers have noted, the timetable is extremely tight.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I welcome the temporary lifting of the restrictions in the Ecological Zone in the Adriatic. It is a positive signal for relations between Slovenia, Italy and Croatia, but environmental considerations must continue to weigh heavily in our treatment of this unique marine environment.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Croatia still has a great deal to do as regards the reform of the legal system and the judicial process. Far too many people still have to wait far too long for a verdict on their cases. This must be prioritised, and the country’s administrative capacity must be developed and expanded.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I welcome the work done by the EU Committee of the Croatian Parliament, which is headed by my good friend Vesna Pusić. We now hope that the negotiations will be excellent and that they can be concluded rapidly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Swoboda’s report is encouraging, realistic and balanced. I congratulate him on it. It shows the progress Croatia has made, such as its exemplary legislation on minorities, its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, its increased commitment to fighting corruption, and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone, which has been particularly difficult to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="de">Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily. An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia. Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon. Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to Macedonia, I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO. People feel they have been unfairly treated. Mr Meijer’s report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden. There is certainly a great deal still to do, but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name, particularly for the young generation. Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other. I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union. This must not happen!</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very disappointed at the current relations between the West and Macedonia. Frankly speaking, the people of Macedonia deserve far better treatment from us.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the independence of Kosovo and the recent failure of NATO accession, the situation is even more complicated. In Macedonia there are separatist elements on one side and nationalists on the other who try to challenge the stability of the country, and the Bucharest decision does not help the situation at all. But perhaps our Macedonian friends can learn at least one lesson from Bucharest. It is not enough to get the support of the US. Many decisions depend on the common accord of the Member States, not only in the European Union but also in NATO, and any Member State may use its veto.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of the latest events Macedonia should reconsider its standpoint on exempting the US from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Many mistakes were committed on both sides – by us and the Macedonian politicians – but we cannot punish ordinary people for our mistakes. That is why at least in the field of visa liberalisation we should act quickly, assisting the Macedonian people to travel, learn and have closer contacts with everyday European life. Three and a half years ago when I was elected Vice-Chairman of the EU-Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I had many optimistic plans on how to improve our relationships. Very few of these ideas were realised. I hope at least in the field of visa liberalisation we can make a step forward.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Greece has consistently supported the European prospects of FYROM, to whose economic development has it contributed. We have worked systematically to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name problem under the auspices of the UN. Greece has made significant steps and now supports a composite name with a universally binding erga omnes geographical indication.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, the other side has not been so willing. Following the outcome of the NATO summit in Bucharest, it is in the interests of all sides that talks should continue and agreement be reached as swiftly as possible. NATO’s decision not to issue an invitation does not mean the rejection of membership but points to the need for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="el">I believe that the original text of my fellow Member Mr Meijer’s report was balanced on this issue. Unfortunately, owing to the amendments adopted, the report on the name issue has been overthrown.

      <p sl="sl">President-in-Office. − First of all, I should like, in the name of the Council, to express my agreement with the statement made by Commissioner Rehn, that this is a crucial year for Croatia on its path to European Union membership. Once again I should like to thank the rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, for the report he prepared, providing a very clear picture of the current situation, the level of development reached, and the future challenges.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We hope that Croatia will seize the opportunity and make fast progress. The fact is that its progress will primarily depend on Croatia itself, and on the pace and the quality of reforms they must complete.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I should like to point out, Mr Schmidt, that the Slovenian Presidency will conduct this agenda with the utmost responsibility. The Slovenian Presidency supports Croatia's progress primarily because its fastest possible progress towards the European Union membership is important for Croatia, but also because it is important for the European Union, and because it is important for the region as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, the responsible conduct of this agenda is to be based on the negotiations framework, which has been agreed with Croatia, based on the revised accession partnership recently adopted by the EU Council, and on other legal acts of the European Union. And it is on this basis that we hope that Croatia will progress as quickly as possible, and the Slovenian Presidency will work towards this end.</p>
      <p sl="sl">As regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Mr Wiersma, Mrs Berès and others have mentioned the danger of political instability in this country. The Slovenian Presidency has sincere hopes that this will not happen. Any political crisis, or possibly early parliamentary elections would slow down the necessary process of reforms for a couple of months.</p>
      <p sl="sl">We would like to see the unity of the citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia preserved and strengthened, irrespective of their political and ethnic allegiances, their unity of views on their joint future in the European Union and the Euro–Atlantic structures. Also important is that, with the Albanian party DPA rejoining the government coalition, the internal political situation has been consolidated.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Now is the time, but the time is limited. We have time only until the next European Commission autumn report, their regular report on the progress that has been achieved. It is important that work completed during this period, which at the end of the year gained additional acceleration, is continued, especially as the political dialogue has been rekindled, and as concrete results have been achieved in the sphere of reforms. A National Council for EU Integration has been established, and an ambitious plan for the fulfilment of the Accession Partnership tasks was adopted. This course should be continued.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The Slovenian Presidency will continue to provide the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with decisive support on this path.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to conclude with the following thought: the issue of Western Balkans stability and the region's faster integration into the European framework must remain one of the Union's top priorities. The Slovenian Presidency has set out this issue as one of its priority tasks. We hope this will continue to be so in the future as well. The fact is that any investment in the future of the Western Balkans in Europe is also an investment in the future of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to express my gratitude to the Member States and the Members of the European Parliament for their very extensive support for the European prospects for the Western Balkans, as well as for your contributions to today's debate. Thank you.</p>

    <intervention id="3-102" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first, let me thank Members for a very substantive debate, which, in my view, underlines the importance of the European perspective for the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of important issues were raised and I can only comment on some of them in this short response. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the Slovenian Presidency for making the Western Balkans a key priority of its term of office. I found the Foreign Ministers’ informal meeting in Brdo, Slovenia, some weeks ago, to be very important, and it certainly gave a new stimulus and dynamism to our policy in the Western Balkans, like this debate. In my view, we are now on the right track.</p>
      <p sl="en">The region has made steady progress over the past couple of years and once the major risks of instability, like the aftermath of the Kosovo status process or the fragility of democracy in Serbia, can be handled well, then I am sure that the region will have a very bright future and that this future is, indeed, in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Presidency has already responded to the points made as regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I can only second those views and say that the country is well placed to take an historic step forward this year if it acts with determination and sustained efforts to meet the benchmarks.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is encouraging that the Macedonian Government has established an action plan to meet benchmarks and a new national plan for the adoption of the acquis . Now I want to encourage the country to implement its own plans and thus pave the way for a positive recommendation from the Commission in the coming autumn.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you referred to visa liberalisation. I can inform you that the Commission is currently working on a road map for visa liberalisation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We will present a draft to the country shortly and, as the country is quite advanced in many respects, for instance on biometric passports, I hope that it will be able to meet the conditions of the road map rather swiftly and thus achieve the goal of visa-free travel for citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia§.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to inform you that we shall shortly – before the end of April – present a road map of this kind for visa-free travel for Serbia where, likewise, ordinary citizens value this extremely highly. We want to facilitate, on our part, this important objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Croatia, I can conclude that a clear majority of the European Parliament has a realistic view of what needs to be done by Croatia for the country to be able to succeed in concluding accession negotiations in the course of 2009. This is good, because the real friends of Croatia should not sweep the problems under the carpet but be honest about what needs to be done and encourage Croatia to implement the necessary reforms on the ground and without delay. Sustained efforts are needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Posselt asked the Commission to step up its efforts and I can assure him that the Commission will have no problems whatsoever in processing negotiating positions in the various chapters once the benchmarks are met by Croatia itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Ek referred to the environmental aspects of overfishing in the Adriatic and I would like to respond to her and inform you all that Prime Minister Sanader told President Barroso and myself of his concern for a special area in the middle of the Adriatic, the ‘Jabuka Pomo Pit’, which is an important spawning ground. The Commission is strongly in favour of the sustainable management of fish stocks and Commissioner Borg has been very active in this matter. The Commission is ready to work on a proposal to establish a fisheries protection area in the Adriatic, as foreseen under the new Mediterranean Regulation. This will need further discussions with Slovenia, Italy and Croatia and, of course, the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr Lebech mentioned the Nordic model as a source of inspiration for the Western Balkans in terms of regional cooperation. I believe that the Nordic Council has already played such a role: it has been used as the model for the Regional Cooperation Council for South-Eastern Europe, based in Sarajevo, which is now the forum for regional political cooperation in the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">I find it encouraging that regional cooperation has substantially improved over the last couple of years and both Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have actively contributed to this success. We have clearly moved from a situation where, only a few years ago, regional cooperation was considered with significant suspicion that it was an attempt to recreate Yugoslavia. There is now a new understanding of its importance, both because of the concrete benefits on the ground – economic benefits, communications, transport, people-to-people contacts – and because regional cooperation moves the countries closer to the European Union. After all, cooperation across borders is what the European Union is all about.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank you once again for a very responsible and substantive debate and congratulate the rapporteurs on their important contributions to this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, our group congratulates you on your election. We supported that very much and we wish you all the best.</p>
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate, which has been highly productive and constructive. I should like to take up on what Mr Schmitt said regarding 2009. I believe we shall find a common solution tomorrow, as it is important to have a common broad base.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why has Croatia been successful? This is because a broad consensus has been achieved in the country and, despite a slight disagreement with regard to the composition of the Joint EU Committee, this will hopefully be the case in future as well. It is also because – even if the country has sometimes had to force itself to do so – it has achieved a real consensus with its neighbours, as was the case with the fishing zone, for instance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore – if I can now establish a link to Macedonia – I should like to make a very clear appeal to our counterparts in Macedonia to learn from this example, to try to reach a consensus at domestic level and also with its neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is easy, of course, to add fuel to the fire here and, like Mrs Beer, to act as a great advocate. As Mrs Pack and many others have said, however, both countries – Greece and Macedonia – have to make a move: and this within the next few days. Making a Macedonian domestic political crisis out of it at this point in time does not help Macedonia. It blocks the path to the EU; it prevents a solution being found with Greece.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hence the link with Croatia I mentioned. Croatia has succeeded thanks to three really very good governments – including the Račan and Sanader governments – which have really taken substantial steps forward and also changed their spots when ‘national interests’ were involved. Hence my appeal once again to continue to establish this common ground in Croatia, my appeal to attempt something similar in Macedonia as well, and my appeal to the Presidency to continue what it has been doing in recent weeks, namely making progress for the region as a whole. I am convinced, Commissioner, that the Commission will do everything it can to bring the negotiations to a close in 2009.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I have heard a great deal of agreement here on Macedonia. Negotiations must come into view, and the difference of opinion with Greece over the name must be resolved. Apart from Mr Stoyanov, who is probably harking back to Macedonia’s original association with Bulgaria under the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878, everyone, Greece included, wants to see Macedonia take its place as an equal in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Up to now, both parties have been expert in explaining the other party’s long-standing commitment. Greece expects Macedonia to change its constitutional name, and until 2 April Macedonia expected Greece not to block its accession to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Both parties fail to realise that all of this is completely incomprehensible to other Europeans. Both parties want this enlargement of the European Union to succeed, but at the same time are helping to delay it further. It now seems to be a game of who makes the first move. If no one does, the enlargement everyone desires will come to a temporary halt.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I agree with Mr Kacin and Mr Pinior that we should not wait for any subsequent reports, but rather seize the first suitable opportunity to start negotiations with Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I should like to conclude my speech in this joint debate on two candidate countries with one remark about Croatia for which my group has not requested separate speaking time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Croatia wanted to join the EU at the start of 2009, but it will be 2010 or 2011. The main problem still outstanding is shipbuilding on the Adriatic coast. It is not without reason that the EP delegation to Croatia is visiting the Rijeka shipyards on 29 April. In my group’s opinion, we should not make any requirements of Croatia that the population could perceive as an insoluble problem and that could make the country’s accession to the European Union unnecessarily controversial.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In short, let us try to promote both countries’ progress towards the European Union, so that, in a number of years’ time, we are able to welcome both Croatia and Macedonia into our midst.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I believe the debate on the 2007 Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should point out two key conclusions: the need for this country’s continuous and firm progress toward integration into the European and transatlantic structures, as well as the importance of promoting the young generation in this republic.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European and transatlantic perspective of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unanimously acknowledged and the 2007 Report welcomes the efforts made in this direction. Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate the importance of continuing these reforms. I also hope that the respect for the rights of ethnic and national minorities will continue to be a priority of the Macedonian Government in order to ensure a solid system of protecting all communities, including the Romanian-speaking people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the end, I emphasize the need to promote the young generation in this republic. It is essential to provide them with all necessary conditions for high-performance education in the spirit of inter-cultural dialogue and mutual tolerance. The mobility and free movement of young Macedonians should be considered a key priority of relations between this country and the EU.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today we approved the report by Mr Swoboda on Croatia, with a view to its accession. On behalf of fishermen throughout the Adriatic, I am delighted at the decision by this accession country not to apply the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone in the Adriatic to EU Member States. If the situation had remained unchanged, we would have been facing unequal and utterly discriminatory treatment between Croatian and EU Member State fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is therefore a victory for the pacta sunt servanda principle, for diplomacy and for common sense. This is a victory once again for the abandonment of posturing to protect nationalistic interests in favour of commitment to the shared principles of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Without any doubt, since the accession negotiations started, Croatia has made decisive efforts to comply with the requirements of the acquis communautaire. We are indeed glad to notice that a number of new negotiation chapters have been opened. The accession of Croatia should become a driving example for all other candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite the substantial efforts made by Croatia to meet EU standards, there are still areas where attention should given such as: the fight against corruption and organised crime, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal, the fight against all forms of discrimination (especially with regard to the Roma and national minorities), the sound use of Community funds, environmental protection measures and public administration reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">These points are essential, as further developments in the above areas would indeed bring greater stability to the country and to the region as a whole. It is clear that the stabilisation of the Western Balkans through the Europeanisation process should remain a top priority objective, for which the finalisation of the accession of Croatia will definitely be a major step forward.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is an encouraging report about Macedonia’s progress. The key to this progress is the renewed political consensus that has been achieved between different parties. Such a consensus greatly helped my country, Estonia, to succeed in the EU accession.</p>
      <p sl="en">Stabilising inter-ethnic relations, financial reforms and a successful fight against organised crime and corruption are just some landmarks of this progress. While guaranteeing minorities their rights we expect that the enlarged autonomy will be used in a responsible way to consolidate the Macedonian state as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Macedonia should also be commended for keeping good-neighbourly relations both with Kosovo and Serbia.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to make a remark on the NATO Summit, which recently took place in Romania, and on the implications of the decisions adopted on some Union issues. In addition to other important decisions, it was decided that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as Serbia, would benefit from increased cooperation with NATO. It was also decided that Ukraine and Georgia would receive the Action Plan for accession by a simplified procedure, when they are prepared.</p>
      <p sl="ro">These decisions are salutary for the European Union: the intensified dialogue and the Action Plan mean more democracy, among other things, and more democracy at the Eastern borders will reduce the dimension of challenges in the field of internal affairs.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Croatia has made successful efforts to overcome existing divisions and to achieve unity between peoples, which is one of the aims of European Union membership.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The accession of Croatia to the European Union would have enormous regional consequences and would help to test the scope of the obligations taken on by the EU for the Western Balkans. Croatia’s considerable engagement in the accession negotiations is a positive sign, the evidence being provided by the large number of open chapters in the negotiations. It is also worth stressing that Croatia has made considerable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law. Immense and continuing engagement is, however, needed to overcome the problems that exist in individual sectors if reforms are to be pushed through. To facilitate integration, a list of the funds required for facilitation purposes needs to be drawn up. It is particularly important to accelerate the process of increasing the powers of the administration for the purpose of introducing new regulations. Acceleration is also required in the process of public sector reform, at local and regional authority level. The administration of justice is another sector requiring fundamental reform.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One major achievement of the Croatian authorities is their unremitting efforts to have war crimes judged by national courts. The improvements noted in the Croatian economy and the reforms in the environmental protection sector are further achievements of the Croatian Government that facilitate the accession process. The report on the progress made by Croatia in 2007 supports the belief that this country, by implementing the goals facing it, is taking an active approach to the accession process.</p>

Croatia's future membership is a logical next step, following the accession of Slovenia in 2004, to increase EU involvement in the region and encourage neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as all the other Western Balkan countries to continue with the consolidation of democracy. For the better administration of this process the Western Balkan region should follow the example of the Nordic Council.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Enlargement and integration of new Member States has been the European Union’s most successful foreign policy. The next phase of this policy must involve the accession of Croatia to the European Union in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Ethnic Hungarians in Romania of course pay close attention to ethnic conflicts taking place around the world, and we have been following events in former Yugoslavia’s recent history too. The biggest lesson from its recent history is that intolerance on the part of the majority, ethnic impatience and nationalist extremism can easily lead a region into conflagration. Croatia has set an example in the region, in terms of both its political and its economic development since the end of the Yugoslav wars.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to say a few words on the implementation of the Habitats Directive in Ireland, with particular reference to turf-cutting on raised bogs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Irish turf-cutters and bog owners are now being asked to cease cutting turf for personal use. This situation has arisen because of the unrestricted industrial and commercial turf-cutting right across the EU, which has resulted in virtually all of Europe’s raised bogs being destroyed. It is vitally important to understand that for many Irish people, both rural and urban, turf-cutting has been practised for generations. These people should not be made to pay the price for the destruction of bogs by others. Also, given that oil is now fetching approximately EUR 110 per barrel, we can see that turf is now a very valuable economic resource for the individuals concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, at national level there must be full compensation for the loss of turf-cutting rights, and flexible arrangements will have to be put in place so that we can balance the rights of owners against the need to conserve the raised bogs.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you very much, Madam President.

      <p sl="es">Since January of this year, Televisión Española, TV3 and Canal Sur have not been allowed permission to broadcast due to the coverage that they have been giving to the conflict, and recently the correspondent for Cadena COPE has been threatened with expulsion, along with Cadena SER and the newspaper La Vanguardia .</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that it is unacceptable, with our neighbourhood policy, for a government – the Government of Morocco – to create a serious problem of freedom of expression and to threaten the whole of the Spanish accredited press in the Kingdom of Morocco, unlike the rest of the European press. I therefore call for a rapid, forceful response from the European Commission in order to put an end to this situation.</p>

The mayor of Mlynky has evicted five Slovak associations from the two rooms in which they carried out their activities. Let me say that when it comes to treatment of the Slovak minority, this act is only the tip of the iceberg. In a Slovak school in the Hungarian village, Slovak is taught as a foreign language for 3 hours a week and a priest says mass in Hungarian. The bilingual village paper is not published any more.</p>

I also want to thank the Hungarian Ombudsman, who in this case favours the Slovak minority. The local authorities, however, seem to be standing their ground. The friendship bridge near the town of Ostrihom, paid for with EU funds, is only 30 kilometres away from this village.

Surely not against states in south-eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Georgia, with their experience of Soviet occupation? In this progressively unifying Europe, do the Germans wish to resurrect the phantoms and demons of 20th century politics, i.e. unions and pacts that led to wars, crimes, the Holocaust and the division of Europe? Is the position taken by Germany in Bucharest a warning signal that a common European foreign policy may be realised at the bidding of the Germans, looking after their own interests, but forgetting the bitter truth of history?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the energy and climate package marks the arrival of a new kind of blackmail: blackmail using carbon emissions. Having announced 575 job losses at Gandrange in Moselle on 4 April 2008, Arcelor-Mittal is agreeing to keep 124 jobs on the site provided that it can have CO2 emissions certificates. And to sweeten the pill of the job losses in Lorraine, Arcelor-Mittal is allowing rumours to circulate of a possible pilot CO2 capture project, although this process has not yet been validated in terms of its energy neutrality. Gandrange in Moselle is becoming the Trojan horse of the energy-intensive industries, with their great defender in the European Council, the French President, Mr Sarkozy.</p>

The Romanian authorities tend to procrastinate when it comes to settling such matters, despite the fact that the relevant EU directives are supposed to be in force in Romania too.</p>

This is a general negative trend and I must protest against such actions.

We all know too about the increase in the cost of living that has ruined middle- and low-income groups. What has the EU done about this? Nothing whatsoever!

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this coming weekend the second phase of the largest commercial seal hunt in the world is about to begin off the coast of Atlantic Canada.

      <p sl="en">Yet, according to independent observers, there is little evidence of this happening. That is, of course, when they have actually been permitted to observe sealing activities. The Department of Fisheries’ systematic attempts to block the observation of this year’s hunt have been almost as alarming as the blatant violations of the sealing regulations that have thus far been recorded. If the Canadian authorities are so very confident that these regulations are being adhered to, then why are they doing their utmost to prevent animal welfare specialists and journalists from witnessing it?</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, we should not forget that no such animal welfare guarantees have ever been made for the commercial seal hunts elsewhere in the world, such as Russia and Namibia. With the current legislature coming to an end, it is vital that the Commission take swift action, in response to Written Declaration 38, by publishing a proposal to ban the import and export of and trade in seal products. Such a ban would not affect subsistence farming, but it would demonstrate a commitment to protect animal welfare.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one positive outcome of the latest enlargement of the Schengen area has been the elimination of controls at internal EU borders. Poland has of course removed all control points and consequently in my province alone we have shut down as many as 55 border crossings. Their closure has, however, presented the local authorities with a need to manage the remaining infrastructure. This comprises a number of buildings, towers, hangars, warehouses and parking areas along with adjacent land, excellently positioned, often beside important international communication routes. The local government districts in which these facilities are located are interested in managing them, but they do not have the funds to do so.

      <p sl="ro">The Commission will soon propose a new amendment to the Directive on charging heavy vehicles for access to the transport infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="ro">By 2008, the Commission has to present, after examining all options, including the costs related to environmental protection, noise, traffic congestion and health, a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensive model for the assessment of all external costs, which would define and serve as a basis for the subsequent calculation of the charges for using infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Any revenue collected in this manner should be reinvested in the related infrastructures. Road carriers need specially equipped parking areas where drivers can rest under conditions of complete safety, as well as their vehicles and carried goods.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe the Member States should be financially supported and, at the same time, forced to invest more in building safe parking areas, improving and developing the transport infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="et">Ladies and gentlemen, European Union Member States from Estonia to Poland lost millions and millions of their most talented and enterprising citizens to Nazi aggression and the decades-long Soviet terror. The European Parliament report ‘Citizens for Europe’ established the action entitled ‘Active European Remembrance’. It was aimed equally at preventing Nazism and Stalinism and at commemorating the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes.</p>
      <p sl="et">Now, 70 years on from Stalin and Hitler’s secret pact, there is still a lack of awareness in Europe of the outrages of Stalin’s apparatus of coercion. The Member States should establish a standing inter-governmental working group with the task of carrying out an impartial examination of the crimes of the Bolsheviks and the KGB and assessing them using European values.</p>
      <p sl="et">Today, however, the date 23 August should be designated European Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism. On 23 August 1939 the Nazis and the Bolsheviks carved Europe into two spheres of influence. In so doing they inflicted a terrible wound on Europe which has not totally healed to this day.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the process of ratification of the EU Reform Treaty is continuing. Following in the footsteps of the French, Romanian, Slovenian and Hungarian parliaments, among others, the Polish Parliament has also taken decisions on ratification. There would perhaps not be anything untoward about this, but for the fact that MPs ratified the Treaty in a great hurry and often failed to get to grips with its content. In view of this situation, the numerous initiatives to ratify the Treaty through national referendums are entirely justified. In a democracy, after all, the citizen is sovereign, not the MP, and the most important form of expression is a referendum, not votes that compromise MPs and parliaments. Citizens have a right not to recognise ratification of the Treaty without it having been read.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These facts already constitute a basis for future political and national conflicts, and everything was in fact supposed to take place in accordance with human rights and the will of free states and peoples in the name of the common good.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in my speech I would like to raise the issue of respect for rights of ownership, the rights of peoples and the rights of religious minorities in Ukraine, which has declared a wish to accede to the European Union. In 1962 the Soviet authorities closed the Catholic church of St Magdalena in Lwów and turned it into an organ recital hall, destroying many valuable relics in the process. Since 1991 the inhabitants of Lwów have been struggling to reclaim their church dedicated to St Magdalena, so far without success.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bearing in mind the reconciliation between the Polish and Ukrainian peoples, I would like to appeal, through the forum of the European Parliament, to the authorities of the city of Lwów for the return of the church to the church authorities, in order to deepen the friendship between our peoples, Polish and Ukrainian, and also in order for this church to become a symbol of reconciliation, which is so important in view of the approaching Euro 2012 Championship.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to raise the issue of the people suffering from leukaemia, who die every day in Romania or in other Member States, without being able to do anything because certain countries are not included in the international register of non-family donors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This register exists in Europe but, unfortunately, not all the Member States have access to this register. In Romania, this register does not function. This shortcoming has led to a much higher mortality rate in Romania than in the other Member States. Hundreds of young people die every day for the simple reason that they don’t have access to this register. Nevertheless, this problem is not a priority for the current government in Romania.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like the Member States to have equal access to this register. This would lead to the decrease in illicit trade in organs and would offer people suffering from leukaemia a chance for life, no matter what their financial situation.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the parallel between the Olympic Games in Beijing and in Moscow 28 years ago. Granting the right to hold the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980 was probably an artful plan designed by Jimmy Carter’s administration and his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to open the Soviet Union, at least for a short period, to the West and its democratic influence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our goal is to trigger democratisation in China and therefore we should appreciate the chance for such an international presence in a country that is otherwise rather isolated. Also, in boycotting the Beijing Olympics, we deprive the Chinese authorities of their triumph. We also lose the opportunity to introduce democratic values to the Chinese people at grassroots level. Our presence at the Olympic Games in Beijing should not be viewed as an acceptance of the Chinese authorities but as an effort to make the Chinese people see the need for the transition to a new regime.</p>

      <p sl="bg">In the past 48 hours, there have been three contract killings in Sofia, Bulgaria. Since Roumen Petkov, the current Minister of Interior, took office, a total of 22 contract killings of business people, mafia bosses and politicians have been carried out in Bulgaria. Not a single one has been solved, not a single person has been convicted. On Monday, in the bright of day, writer Georgi Stoev was murdered. He authored several books of investigations into organised crime. In the meantime it has emerged that Minister Petkov had been in communication with criminal elements on a regular basis and even met with such individuals. These facts are a clear indication of the complete merging of government and mafia. What I am saying is that Bulgaria’s Interior Minister is a mafia guy.</p>

On Monday, in the centre of Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia, writer Georgi Stoev was shot dead in a demonstrative assassination. In a series of ten or so books he dared shed light on the whole truth about organised crime in our country and its close ties with the political elite and the judiciary.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This contract killing, one of many, has shown with ruthless clarity that the prosecution office, the judicial system and the Ministry of Interior in our country either do not have the might to deal with crime or, which even more scary, lack the will to do so.

It is not by chance that Mr. Barroso, the President of the European Commission himself said so directly during his recent visit to Bulgaria.

      <p sl="pt">Commissioner Vassiliou is with us for the first time to take part in this debate. Welcome, Commissioner; I hope you will feel at home among us. Your speech, when the moment comes, will mark the beginning of your cooperation and collaboration with the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="cs">First of all, I would like to take this opportunity, as the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to congratulate the Commissioner, who was nominated and appointed to the Commission today. Although serious reasons prevented me from listening to her presentation in person, I must say that she made an excellent impression on the members of my committee and was unanimously welcomed in her new capacity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Regarding the oral question, I would like to begin by explaining what made us tackle this issue and ask individual states to pay more attention to this serious diagnosis. You probably know, from the emphasis in the report and in the question, that cancer cases in Europe are on the increase. There are a number of reasons for this: as we know, the population is ageing and more and more people are exposed to carcinogens. According to the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace. We have to bear in mind that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Another important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States. This imbalance is surely also food for thought. What can we do in this area and what can we recommend to the European Community? A structure such as the EU undoubtedly has the capacity and power to coordinate individual national policies. By adopting national cancer control programmes we can reduce cancer mortality by as much as 30%. We know that only 3% of the total budget in developed countries is spent on cancer prevention, compared with 97% on treatment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to take this opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of patients, who become the focus of our treatment and should become the focus of our care: they should have better access to new scientific knowledge and new information. The European Union should push ahead with a single register and, as far as possible, common education. Paradoxically, the European Union has not yet introduced in all its Member States as undeniably important a topic as oncology. Although oncology is an interdisciplinary subject, its recognition as a subject in its own right is a necessary condition if we want to successfully fight this disease.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Since I would like to allow my colleague from the PPE-DE Group, Professor Trakatellis, to use some of my speaking time, I will now conclude my introduction.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my first official appearance before Parliament, so let me firstly express my thanks to its Members for placing their trust in me through their vote. I repeat what I said at my hearing: I aim to cooperate with MEPs fruitfully and to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p sl="el">Now, Mr President, to the subject of cancer:</p>
      <p sl="el">In addition to the priority given to cancer by you and by the Slovenian Presidency, this issue has been a particular concern of mine for many years, so I am pleased that it is the first topic for me to address in front of the plenary.</p>
      <p sl="el">Every year 3.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with cancer, but this burden is not spread equally across the Union. For example, the most recent data shows that cervical cancer is over four times higher in Bulgaria than in Finland, and the risk of dying from cervical cancer is almost five times higher in Lithuania than in Italy. These variations show that there is scope to do better across the Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">Clearly, the primary responsibility for comprehensive cancer services lies with the Member States, but European action can make a difference. The Commission is currently preparing a report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening of 2003. I expect that this will show that progress has been made, but that more still needs to be done. We will work with the Member States to pursue this.</p>
      <p sl="el">But even though screening is important, I think that Community action against cancer must cover a wider range of topics. For example: health information and data on the cancer burden that will highlight inequalities and best practices across Europe; preventative measures and health promotion on topics such as tobacco, nutrition and alcohol; best practices on treatment and integrated cancer care, such as palliative care; bringing together expertise through European reference networks; providing investment in infrastructure through the Structural Funds; and support for cancer research at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="el">I plan to bring forward proposals for an action plan on cancer next year. This will aim to provide focus and coherence for all these actions. We will also consider whether the scientific evidence justifies updating the existing recommendation on cancer screening. Some actions are already under way. We plan to include provisions for European reference networks as part of the forthcoming proposals on the application of patient rights in cross-border health care. The proposals later this year on rare diseases will also help to improve, inter alia , the situation regarding rare types of cancer.</p>
      <p sl="el">Moreover, when a person has cancer, it affects them most, but it also affects their family, their employer and society as a whole. My proposals will be accompanied by an impact assessment that will make clear not just the human cost of cancer but also the wider social and economic costs.</p>
      <p sl="el">I look forward to hearing your suggestions on issues we need to address as we develop those proposals. You may be sure that your proposals will be taken into account as we develop this action plan, and I count on your support for all our future actions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, firstly let me congratulate the Commissioner on taking up her duties. I welcome the views she has already expressed on cancer. Commissioner, I think it is time for us to adopt an effective strategy on cancer in line with current scientific and technological progress, so that the disease can stop being the main cause of death in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today, one third of all cancers are preventable. We must therefore review the existing preventive programmes and measures and create new ones to cover every eventuality.</p>
      <p sl="el">If we expand our scientific knowledge, we must review the Council’s recommendation on early diagnosis and improve diagnostic methods for more types of cancers. In addition to breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, we must add skin cancer, and possibly lung and prostate cancer. Strengthening prevention and early diagnosis could cover nearly 70% of cases.</p>
      <p sl="el">For cases where prevention or early diagnosis is not possible, as you said, we need to improve therapeutic strategies and practice by being more effective and innovative. We must ensure that full use is made of the treatments provided by ever more successful innovation and research. It is necessary simply to incentivise research into innovative cancer treatments and to increase research funding.</p>
      <p sl="el">Naturally, bureaucratic formalities should not hinder research. Moreover, authorisation procedures should be reviewed in such a way that it becomes possible both to accelerate procedures for new drugs and to adhere to high standards of safety. Commissioner, this is all feasible today. The means made available by the EU may allow us in the immediate future to control cancer, thus almost freeing European citizens of this scourge.</p>
      <p sl="el">With steady focus on this goal, we are thus called upon today to move forward. We must do so, as you said, by drawing up the various composite elements of this strategy. We hope that both the European Commission and the Council will support Parliament’s resolution and will take appropriate measures to achieve our targets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, cancer affects one in three of us across the European Union and results in over one million deaths. Therefore this disease has a twofold cost: firstly, the human cost in terms of its impact on sufferers and their families and, secondly, as a major health burden to society as a whole. Further, due to the demographic changes we are experiencing, and with an ageing population, this is a problem that will only increase.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to ensure that all our citizens have access to high-quality screening programmes, diagnosis and treatment, including palliative care. A cancer task force would ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach to all aspects of the disease, ensuring exchange of information and promotion of best practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must ensure that more is done to secure research and innovation, giving as many people as possible access to the best in cancer prevention and treatment. We also need to highlight the link between cancer and obesity – the most avoidable cause of cancer after tobacco. It is also vital to ensure that workers are protected from cancer-causing substances – around 8% of all cancers are caused by exposure to carcinogens at work – and we need binding limits on crystalline silica, which can cause disabling illness and fatal lung disease. On that point, I would urge Members to support paragraph 33 and recital K of the original text agreed by the committee – remember the construction industry is not party to the social partners’ agreement on crystalline silica.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are massive disparities in cancer treatment and screening across Europe. Many of the deaths from cancer could be avoided by prevention measures, such as access to information and to comprehensive screening programmes. Tackling these disparities must be a priority. It is our moral duty and it is possible. What we need is the political will to achieve it.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to use this opportunity to thank the Slovenian Presidency for putting cancer so high on its political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">I want to highlight one initiative in particular: the European Cancer Patient Summit, which was held this week here in Brussels under the patronage of the Slovenian Presidency, with the participation of more than 150 patient groups from all over Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">This very successful summit, where I also had the honour of addressing the audience, was the first event our new Commissioner for Health attended in this capacity. I must admit I was impressed by the Commissioner’s speech and the commitment she expressed for the fight against cancer as a whole and the concerns of cancer patients in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">I was also very happy to learn that the Commissioner intends to put forward a new cancer action plan, starting next year, to ensure that cancer remains high on the Commission’s agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">These initiatives from the Presidency and the Commission must encourage all of us to focus on what should be done, rethink what we have achieved and discover where the current deficits are. And now we are very much looking forward with high expectations to the upcoming Council conclusions on this topic. I am confident that these conclusions will provide a very good and solid basis for the following presidencies to continue along the lines set out therein. Therefore, I would like to strongly encourage the upcoming French Presidency to follow up on established initiatives and to keep cancer high on its agenda.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to thank all those colleagues who contributed very much in drafting the motion for a resolution on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union, on which we will vote tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, may I, too, add my congratulations. You are a cancer expert, since you were the director of an oncological centre before you came here as a Commissioner, so you must be used to what you are hearing now.</p>
      <p sl="el">I will not take issue with the statistical data that my fellow Members are giving you. Mr Trakatellis said that 30% of people can be saved by prevention. As an oncologist myself, I can assure you that a further 30% can be saved by reliable screening programmes. Yet how many of the 27 Member States have such programmes?</p>
      <p sl="el">You must do something about this; coordination and hence assistance need to be assured. Perhaps you will also have to use funds from the Structural Funds and the 7th Framework Programme so that all these methods can contribute. You must help to raise the profile of oncology, since, as you have said, this is very important. The Slovenian Presidency is to be congratulated, but just as important is the creation of a task force wholly dedicated to the issue of cancer.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Commissioner, I, too, would like to congratulate you on your nomination.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It makes me very happy to see that the issue of cancer is being dealt with not only by experts but also by politicians, which is very important in this case. The experts are drawing our attention to alarming statistics and the trends in cancer occurrence are extremely unfavourable. Yesterday I was talking with patient organisations until lunchtime, and I can tell you that what they want is adequate treatment, which can be very demanding, especially in the case of rare types of cancer. There is still a huge gap between the 15 old and the 12 new Member States regarding the occurrence of this disease, its late diagnosis and the approach to its treatment at all stages of the disease. Insufficient prevention and late diagnosis or treatment aggravate the patients’ state of health and their chances of getting better.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Commissioner, please ensure that the fight against cancer is not just a priority during the six-month presidency, or for professional medical organisations such as ESMO or patient organisations. We, the Members of this Parliament, will also give you our support in the search for a solution.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Commissioner, I did not expect to have the chance to talk to you about cancer three times in one week. I see that we have a Commissioner who knows how things are with cancer, and who will, together with us, put up a fight. Because knowing that health is the responsibility of member states, the European citizens wish certain tasks to be performed at European level, since it is only at this level that they can be performed properly.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I am pleased that you have announced the action plan to fight cancer. We need it urgently, and if cancer has the exponential dynamics of epidemics, we too must have our own political dynamics, otherwise the gap and the consequences of cancer will become even more serious.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I am pleased the Slovene Presidency has strengthened expectations that, in the future, activities will be more coordinated, there will be more continuity, and the initiatives will be more vigorous, and, as you yourself put it on another occasion earlier this week, that this will coincide with multi-partnerships.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Moreover, I believe that it would be better if countries holding the EU presidency did not prioritise only single aspects, but continuously considered the entire frontline against cancer, as has already been mentioned today.</p>
      <p sl="sl">In this spirit, I hope that with your help, a task group could be formed – or we could call it something else – to bring together the main institutions and key actors in the fight against cancer, not with the intention of creating a new bureaucracy, but in order to achieve better combined results owing to good methods of cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, the media in my country are noting Germany’s successful record on mammography screenings. Once again the EU guidelines on quality assurance have proved their worth. However, demands are already being made to offer this to younger women as well. This shows how important European guidelines are.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, in its motion for a resolution, too, this House will tomorrow be calling for the further development of evidence-based EU guidelines on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of all widespread cancers and the formulation of an urgently needed accreditation and certification procedure for relevant facilities. Criteria on their own are not enough here. Only in this way will we manage to put quality above populism and above class and market interests when it comes to the early detection and treatment of cancer.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, cancer is already the second biggest killer in Europe, but the reality is that many cancers are preventable and many cancer deaths unnecessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">Screening, diagnosis and treatment have improved but not enough. We must set up mechanisms at EU level to ensure that best practice is shared more effectively. Take colorectal cancer, for instance. It is estimated that over 27 000 lives could be saved in the EU each year if modern screening programmes were in place across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to make sure that those diagnosed with cancer are not discriminated against in the workplace. That should be covered by the Employment Directive 2000 on combating discrimination in the workplace, but many Member States do not class chronic illness and cancer as a disability. That is why we need a definition of disability at EU level that could include people with cancer.</p>

Research on cancer detection and prevention should also be funded under the seventh framework programme. I welcome the contribution made today to this debate by the Commission. Strategies which include women and, particularly, inexpensive and regular cervical screening and inexpensive and rapid breast screening must be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We must also look at the effect of chemicals, which must be regulated through the REACH regulation.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Finally, poverty is a key factor in ill health. Poor people are more likely to become ill and die at an earlier age than those who are more affluent. This is especially true in respect of cancer prevention and cure.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I, too, want to welcome the fact that Mrs Vassiliou was today appointed the new Health Commissioner. I expect a lot from this new cooperation and, personally speaking, her presentation in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety convinced me of her qualifications and her appetite for solving certain problems, for example those related to smoking, which is a subject dear to my heart.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In this context, I would now like to concentrate on a similar topic. We know that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and that the most common diagnoses are lung cancer, bowel cancer (which some people have mentioned) and breast cancer. It is well known that lung cancer occurs up to five times more often than all other types of cancer combined. There is absolutely no doubt that passive smoking causes cancer just as active smoking does, and we also know that up to 95% of people who are diagnosed with lung cancer are smokers or passive smokers. Putting warnings on cigarette packets is not enough. It is time for adequate legislation to protect non-smokers to be introduced in the old and new Member States that are still putting if off, for reasons that are difficult to comprehend. In countries where good and sufficiently restrictive laws are in place, the health situation has improved significantly and billions have been saved instead of spent on cancer patient treatment.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, articles recently published in professional medical literature point to a direct link between hormonal contraception and breast cancer. I want to ask the Commission and our programmes to allocate funds to research in this area, too, in order to reverse these trends and improve women’s health.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, cancer, as many know, is not necessarily an incurable disease. Modern treatment methodologies, along with early and more accurate diagnosis, mean that many forms of cancer are today eminently treatable with success.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, much remains to be done and this is why the EU must take it upon itself to declare an all-out war on cancer. We must fight this disease on all fronts, with strong aggression and endless determination. Our efforts must, for example, be directed at making sure that efficient screening programmes are in operation and implemented among those sections of the population that most need them. They must also be directed at ensuring that sufficient funding is always available to the research institutions that provide our hope for the future. Our citizens must be reassured that cancer can be defeated and we, in the European Parliament, are determined to continue to support this fight until, and unless, this is accomplished.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Madam President, and greetings to the new Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Cancer is the second most common cause of death. In both 1993 and 2003, Hungary came first in the world in terms of cancer deaths, with the most common being lung, bowel and breast cancers.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We know the causes: unhealthy diet, too little exercise, contraceptives, alcohol, smoking, and harmful environmental factors. We know that the most cost-effective way to combat cancer is prevention, and yet there are Member States, including Hungary for example, where this year money is only being put into screening programmes for mouth, breast and cervical cancers, but not other types of cancer. Patients have to wait six to eight weeks for CT and MRI scans and to commence treatment.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is good that the Slovenian Presidency has taken up the fight against cancer as one of its priorities; but this cannot be a one-off action. The fight against cancer must be among the priorities of each successive presidency, if only because the incidence of this terrible disease in Europe is rising and will continue to rise as our society ages. I would like to draw attention to the inequalities emphasised by the Commissioner in the detection and treatment of cancer, which are so apparent when we compare the old and the new Union. Statistics point to a higher survival rate and lower mortality in the old EU, and I therefore appeal to the European Commission to apply special monitoring to the implementation of the EU programme ‘Europe Against Cancer’ in Central and Eastern Europe in particular.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Madam President. I too would like to say a few words about the importance of prevention. This debate has touched on the issue of smoking. Smoking is perhaps a good example of how social opposition can be generated; in many places nowadays smoking is not – if I can put it this way – a cool or trendy thing to be doing.</p>
      <p sl="hu">At the same time, cancer has other causes that have not so far aroused healthy social opposition. Chemical contamination and air pollution are major causes of cancer. In the area of environmental protection, however, the kind of social awareness has not yet developed that would make us realise that certain chemicals must be taken out of our system, that excessive urban traffic is bad for city dwellers’ health, or that reducing the amount of toxicants and pollution we are exposed to involves changing our whole lives.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, thanks are due to the Slovenian Presidency for recognising the fight against cancer as one of its priorities for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Sadly, in the European Union cancer reaps a harvest of one million lives each year. The numbers are shocking. During our lifetime, a tumour will be diagnosed in around 33% of people living in Europe, and for 25% it is the cause of death. The highest percentage of people dying of lung, prostate or breast cancer is recorded in the new Member States, i.e. in the poorest countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Action needs to be taken at EU level to enable the disparities in oncological services to be ironed out, and especially where monitoring and screening are concerned.

      <p sl="en">I have been described as an expert on cancer. I must say that I am not an expert on cancer. There are people here who are really experts on cancer, but I am a person who has worked for many years in the fight against cancer and I will remain as such.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have heard very interesting comments. I will try to answer some of them, but rest assured that I have taken note of all the comments that were made, and we shall include them in our deliberations when we formulate our action plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning Structural Funds, the Commission has now included health as one of the priority areas for funding, so the funds can be used for health infrastructure, including cancer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mention was made of carcinogens in the workplace. We already have strong European standards, as you know, on health and safety. The Commission will, of course, work to keep those standards updated as science updates our knowledge of risks. I will work on this with Commissioner Špidla, who is responsible for this area of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The suggestion was made repeatedly concerning the setting-up of an interinstitutional task force to fight cancer. I would examine this during the deliberations of the forthcoming Health Council in Slovenia, and I would also make another addition to this suggestion: that I would like to see representatives of patients and of professionals included in this task force.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recognition of oncology as a specialisation is something that is, indeed, very necessary, but I would point out that this is something for the Member States to do. But, as far as I am concerned, I will exert all my influence in encouraging Member States to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many speakers spoke about anti-smoking campaigns. We all know that smoking is one of the most serious detriments to health, and my intention is not only to continue the campaign against smoking but also to try to involve youth in this campaign, not only to make it less trendy for them but also to make them understand that it is to their benefit not to start smoking, and make them involved actively in the campaign so that the word is spread among young people, because that is the first stage to prevent smoking – to start with the young people.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, many other interesting proposals have been made. I will take all of them into consideration, and I will continue to work closely with Members of Parliament in reaching a very good action plan for next year.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the main points of the report in question. On one aspect, however, I believe we need to be clearer and more decisive: greater resources must be invested in research, in fact and not just in words, and researchers must be guaranteed better conditions. Important results have been achieved in the last few years, giving greater hope to those with cancer and their families, but there is still a long way to go.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I think a more secular approach to the ethical issues would be desirable in each of the 27 Member States, because these often constitute a hindrance and constraint on research freedom.

      <p sl="sk">Although calling the number of cancer cases in the European Union an ‘epidemic’ is alarming, it is an appropriate term because cancer claims over 1 million lives a year. However, epidemics spread in those countries where the hygiene and epidemiology standards are not met and people live in poor conditions or do not have access to effective health care. I do not know which of these conditions the EU fulfils.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We are talking about a cancer epidemic in the EU at the same time as we are talking about improving the economy and competitiveness, about massive investment in prevention, in new effective treatment methods and in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
      <p sl="sk">My country, the Slovak Republic, has for more than 30 years been running a national oncology programme to prevent cancer. In spite of that, cancer incidence rates continue to rise. Is this the doctors’ fault or the patients’ fault?</p>
      <p sl="sk">How are the EU funds for cancer prevention used? In 2003 the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality prepared an own-initiative report on breast cancer. Although it accurately identified the causes and possible solutions, only a little of what was included in the report has been implemented.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Sometimes I feel that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and that our society, and the EU as a whole, deliberately keep quiet about the real reasons for this disease, perhaps in order to project a better image and for fear of telling the truth. Fighting cancer cannot be a priority for just one EU presidency. Its implementation as a systematic EU policy should already have been the norm for several years.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The next item is the report by Riitta Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (2007/2204(INI)) (A6-0074/2008).</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, the targets under the Sixth Environment Action Programme are not going to be achieved as a result of the sort of environmental policy being implemented in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The thematic strategies planned as the cornerstone of the Environment Action Programme and the legislation passed and largely now adopted based on them are insufficient to achieve the environmental targets. The decline in biodiversity is unlikely to be halted and legislation on the protection of the seas will not have any effect until 2012. Soil protection, as we know, has run into problems, not just in the Council but also here in Parliament. Legislation on waste is now on the home run, and it does not look good. We need to achieve satisfactory targets in the reduction in the volume of waste. Nor are the targets agreed in the air quality directive at the level agreed in the Sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The targets in the Environment Programme are, however, being achieved in one area, and that is climate policy. That is the case especially when the measures which have now been agreed are actually implemented. We have to remember that the implementation of climate policy also helps when it comes to air quality and partly also waste, so in that respect it is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fi">What then can we still do to get back on the road to achieving the targets in the Sixth Environment Action Programme? First of all, Member States have to step up national implementation of EU legislation. The Commission must be given the necessary resources for it to be able to ensure that all Member States are attending to their obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another big issue, and one which is perhaps the most important of them all, is how we manage to integrate the environment within all European Union legislation. We have spoken about this for years, but as yet nothing has been done in practice.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We still have areas where we subsidise activity which is environmentally harmful. We must now do away with environmentally damaging subsidies, and Parliament should propose a timetable for this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Any policy that is environmentally favourable is to be recommended, including taxation measures. Unless legislation at European level can be used to develop eco-taxation, we will have to employ the means available to us, for example, flexible cooperation, using that to take tax matters forward. If the state of the environment is to be improved, binding legislation still needs to be a priority.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like to thank all the groups who took part in this work, and I wish to say that I have tabled a few amendments solely with the purpose of clarifying the text and make its tone more balanced.</p>

    <intervention id="3-194" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Stavros Dimas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of results is a priority for the Commission. Our environmental policy has been – and is – a very successful EU policy, since it has offered its citizens clear and tangible benefits.</p>
      <p sl="el">Around 80% of the Member States’ environmental legislation is based on corresponding EU legislation. The latter has made a vital contribution to major improvements in air and water quality, as well as to the protection and maintenance of Europe’s natural resources. The EU is thus able to play a leading international role in issues such as climate change, biodiversity and legislation on chemical products.</p>
      <p sl="el">Nearly a year has passed since the Commission published its Communication on the Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme. Last year was particularly important, since environmental issues were constantly to at the top of the EU’s list of political priorities. Over this period we have wholly fulfilled our political commitments. Let me give you three examples of this.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the Bali Summit last December, a procedure was launched to achieve a new agreement on global climate until the end of 2009. The EU’s ‘green diplomacy’ was largely instrumental in achieving this positive result. The package of proposals on climate and energy produced by the Commission in January was ambitious and demonstrated the EU’s continuing commitment to setting a global example.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposed new directive on industrial emissions strengthens the provisions already in force and simplifies existing legislation merging seven different directives, on integrated pollution prevention and control. Thus our legislation has become easier to implement and we are contributing towards making it more environmentally effective.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the past year important progress was made. One of the main messages of the mid-term review – that the long-term viability of the European economy needs to be based on sound environmental principles – was largely accepted by industry. The high standards set by EU environmental legislation encourage ecological innovation, which in turn boosts industrial productivity and creates new employment. In other words, the ambitious environmental goals are both improving European citizens’ quality of life and central to achieving our goals in economic development and employment.</p>
      <p sl="el">These positive developments contradict scientific evidence that Europe has not yet entered a phase of sustainable development. In fact, we are only half-way through the time period covered by the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, so there is obviously plenty more to be done in tackling the current and emerging threats to our environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">In the coming months the Commission will produce new proposals, many of which are included in Parliament’s report. These initiatives include the review of the directive on national emissions ceilings, and a package of proposals in the area of sustainable consumption and production.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are also preparing a legislative proposal on restricting timber trafficking from illegal logging. After the summer, communications will be ready concerning the European view on the issue of halting deforestation and on finding ways of recording companies’ results using criteria that go further than GDP.</p>
      <p sl="el">We are also preparing a proposal to prohibit trade in the skins of seals that have been inhumanely hunted.</p>
      <p sl="el">Improved implementation of Community legislation is a major priority; it is the key to creating a better environment. Only by ensuring the correct implementation of the acquis communautaire in its entirety can the goals of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme possibly be achieved. Effective implementation is connected with better legislation. I can now express my satisfaction because in the last two years the Commission has been able to disassociate better legislation from lower environmental standards. The truth is that the older and simpler legislation is one of the better ways of improving the implementation of the new rules and can thus contribute to better environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am especially pleased that in your report there are constructive conclusions on the way in which Europe can successfully create a better environment and genuine sustainable development. I assure you that the Commission will examine these conclusions with great care when analysing areas where it can see policy gaps and when setting out priorities for the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her efforts and likewise Mr Karim, Mrs Jeleva and Mr Navarro from the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their excellent recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is obvious that there is broad agreement as regards the way forward. It now remains for us to transform this support policy into concrete action to ensure a better environment from 2012 onwards.</p>

      <p sl="bg">opinion draftsperson for the REGI Committee . − Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, as the opinion draftsperson for the Regional Development Committee I would like to underline the significant role of regional and local government authorities in ensuring environmental protection and sustainable development. Regions and municipalities are where decisions have to be acted upon, and the environmental acquis implemented in practice.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Water supply and water treatment, waste management, public transportation and urban planning are just a few examples. The Member States, their regional and local authorities should be encouraged to make the best use of structural funds while ensuring that their operational programmes contribute for a more effective implementation of environmental legislation. It is obvious that some regions experience difficulties in implementation. Special measures should be developed in the framework of the cohesion policy to overcome these difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="bg">In conclusion, regional cooperation should be used as a vital tool in environmental policy. Cooperation among Member States and with countries and regions from the EU neighbourhood such as the Black Sea, Baltic and Mediterranean opens up opportunities to prevent transborder pollution.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In terms of the goals set out in the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, we are lagging behind in many regards. I would like to mention just two of these here.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The air in our cities is polluted and unhealthy. In the absence of Community legislation, in many cities achieving the goals set out in the thematic strategy on the urban environment seems a very long way off. The Commission must therefore put forward legislation that clearly defines a framework for the urban environment and urban transport in the whole of the European Union, as otherwise our citizens will continue to suffer from poor air quality and other forms of pollution.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Similarly, implementation of the Water Framework Directive keeps stalling. If legislation on industry does not accord with policies on agriculture and rural development, then our water resources will continue to be polluted. As demonstrated by the foam on the River Raba in Hungary resulting from pollution by Austrian leather manufacturers, current legislation is not able to prevent contamination of water resources.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The Member States and the Commission must do everything in their power to ensure universal compliance with the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, many thanks to Riitta Myller for her excellent report and for her cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety says, the implementation of the EU’s Environment Programme is in many respects late, but what is even more startling is that, even if all the concrete targets set thus far were fully achieved, the EU would still not be on the road to sustainable development. For example, we probably will not manage to halt the decline in biodiversity by 2010, even if we are committed to doing so.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The unpleasant truth is that our society is constructed to work in a way that is unsustainable. If everyone on earth consumed resources the way Europeans do, we would need four earths to produce the necessary resources. If the middle classes of China, India and other developing countries copy our consumption habits the planet will be in crisis. I hope that the wake-up call that is now on its way thanks to climate policy will result in a more comprehensive reassessment of our lifestyle and production habits.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you, Madam President. Let me begin by saying that I, too, disagree that implementation of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme is going according to plan. Moreover, in many cases concrete quantitative and qualitative targets and timetables are lacking, not only in the Action Programme, but also in the thematic strategies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There is no doubt that implementation of the Sixth Action Programme is behind schedule; we have not yet managed to meet the priority environmental objectives set out in the Programme, and implementation of the legislation in the Member States keeps stalling. Let me give you a concrete example.</p>
      <p sl="hu">First: no concrete steps have been taken to draft legislation concerning indoor air quality. A particular priority in this regard is the drafting of provisions relating to schools and other public indoor spaces used by vulnerable groups. At the very least, pilot projects should be initiated.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Second: implementation of directives on the Natura 2000 networking programme has also stalled. Best practice needs to be disseminated, and fiscal measures put in place against polluters. I myself have approached the Commission with a submission relating to contamination of Natura 2000 areas, but the Commission has merely been sitting on its hands and has not taken any action.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Third: illegal dumping of hazardous and municipal waste in the territory of other countries has proliferated in recent times. Africa and Asia are often the destination of European waste, and this is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is the fact that several German Länder are illegally transporting many thousands of tonnes of waste to eastern Europe, and then refuse to take it back – take the case of Bavaria, for example.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Fourth: whatever happened to the fine principle of preventing cross-border pollution? One Member State, Austria, has been polluting the River Raba for the past seven years, as Mr Hegyi mentioned earlier. Thick foam floats on the surface of the river. I have raised this issue at least half a dozen times already, and indeed I have also made a formal complaint, but to no avail: the foam on the river remains, while the Commission sits there doing nothing.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Fine principles are meaningless unless they are implemented. The Commission is the guardian of European Union law. It is time for this guardian to do its duty and not give in to Member States, but instead to ensure compliance with the laws that we have jointly adopted. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. I think it reflects Parliament’s concerns about how much the Union has so far abided by its commitments within the framework of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission’s mid-term review reveals that coordinated efforts are required to plug the gaps in legislation with new legislative proposals. It is also necessary to secure the requisite resources to ensure proper implementation of Community legislation. Meanwhile, it is becoming understood that a greater reliance has to be placed on a sustainable model of production and consumption, and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is just as important to emphasise the international dimension of European environmental policy. The Union must be encouraged to continue promoting ambitious environmental policies and requirements, and to develop technology transfer and the exchange of good practice with developing countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I really do not think that the document that we are considering is what it could be, and I will explain: it is a document to assess what has been done with the broad guidelines that the European Commission had proposed for the environment, and for all environmental policy. I do not think that it is an assessment document. It is not a detailed assessment document that could have helped us to plan for the future, perhaps because the Commission is not accustomed to being judged or assessed, nor does it vote, or have a group of shareholders that demand results from it. I do think, however, although it may appear to be a contradiction, that the Commission can be congratulated on the results that it has had in recent years, but not on the document.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that environmental policy has been absolutely integrated into municipal and regional policies, and industry itself is responding to the European Union guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the document lacks a projection of how we need to change for the future, because those points where the system has not worked well need to be reviewed. Europe has been making environmental policy for more than 25 years and it needs to review some of its methods, because this is not the only thing that explains the failure of some policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks, whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude. There are now many countries, as happened with the Soil Directive, that already have much better regulations than Europe can give them and others that do not have any. In response to this imbalance, Europe needs to take different positions and look for new ways of working, because it is logical that, if the world has changed, we should change our working methods.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thank you very much, congratulations on the results but let us change in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, it is very important that the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme has brought to light an important fact: implementation of this programme is running well behind the planned schedule.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As a result, the likelihood that everything will be done by 2012 and that the priority goals will be met is rather low. I share the opinion that clearer and more tangible quantitative and qualitative goals still need to be incorporated into the programme. I also agree that the submission of thematic strategies has not generated effective results. For this reason, I would stress the need for further efforts to eliminate loopholes in environmental laws by means of new legislative proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should carry out these evaluations from time to time, and in particular publish the findings from the Member States in a register, as conflicts do occur on the individual issues, of course, over the years, for example in the case of the Water Framework Directive, where we are going to great lengths on the one hand to promote renewable energy, but on the other hand are wasting unused water.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first mention the excellent comments that have been made tonight. The Commission will of course take these into account and put them to good use accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="el">In its mid-term review, the Commission came to the conclusion that the EU was generally on the right track as regards fulfilling the measures set out in the Sixth Environment Action Programme. If we continue to make progress in these crucial years, we shall be able to carry out the proposals contained in the programme up to 2012. The preparation of the proposals, however, and even their adoption and approval, account for only half of the work required. As has been pointed out tonight, without effective implementation of environmental policy, we will certainly not reach the environmental targets set in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, however well the legislation may have been prepared by the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="el">For precisely this reason, I fully share Parliament’s view that greater efforts are needed and sufficient resources must be made available to the Commission to enable us to continue to deal properly with implementation issues. This will allow the Commission to help national authorities to develop those capacities necessary to achieve the results we are aiming for.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission also shares Parliament’s view that it is vitally important to incorporate environmental issues into other policies. As the report makes clear, this integration is crucial in trade policies, since the EU has highly significant economic relations with other countries of the world, and trade has an obvious environmental impact. It is just as important, however, that environmental issues be incorporated into agricultural, regional and transport policy: if the essential funding is provided, Community policies will have a significant effect on the regions of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">The impact study procedure, also established by the Commission, aims to improve the cohesion of Community policies and includes an assessment of all the environmental parameters of our proposals. The Commission would like the European Parliament’s support so that a full assessment of all environmental aspects can be guaranteed during the consideration of proposals by other institutions as well.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, the report highlights the key role of the national, regional and local authorities, as well as of citizens, consumers and businessmen, in attaining the environmental targets set in the EU’s Sixth Environment Action Programme. I assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to raise the programme’s profile and to secure the support of the parties concerned. I am sure that Parliament will assist in these efforts and I hope that the protection of the European environment will be one of the main issues of concern to voters in next year’s elections.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who took part in the debate and the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Parliament and I, as rapporteur, are actually aiming at a situation where the Commission acquires new instruments to get environmental policy on a path which leads to the targets under the Sixth Environment Action Programme being attained. In its mid-term report the Commission said it was its opinion, just as Commissioner Dimas remarked, that the means cited in the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme would be enough to achieve this, but a study which has been undertaken on the Commission’s current policy indicates otherwise.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This report, which hopefully will be adopted tomorrow with a large majority, indicates areas where improvements are still needed at European level, and it mentions very largely the same remedies as those proposed in the Commissioner’s speech. In other words, we are of the same opinion as to what needs to be done, but, as Mrs Hassi said here, whether or not the means proposed are generally adequate to get the European Union on the road to sustainable development we shall certainly have to have very frank discussions together. We are now on the right path with regard to climate policy. If we establish such ambitious policies in the other areas, then surely we will succeed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I said I had tabled a few amendments in order to clarify this report. I would just like to mention that that the Finnish in Amendment 14 is very odd: the English text should be used as a reference.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I think it would be a good thing if we were to accept the Sixth Environment Action Programme according to Article 251 of the EC Treaty, i.e. through a codecision procedure. Protecting the environment is a matter of exceptional importance for the EP, which, after all, represents some 500 million Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Including the EP in the codecision procedure distinctly demonstrates the role it has. The 10 year operating period of the Sixth Action Programme requires regular evaluations, especially as regards its priorities. It is true that the thematic strategies included in the programme have improved the participation of stakeholders and developed the dimension of environmental policy, but at the same time they have delayed or prolonged the process of law-making in this sphere.</p>
      <p sl="en">A disgraceful example has been set by the unfinished air quality directive. Parliament has rightly commented that the greatest progress has been made in those subsections of the Programme concerning which no separate thematic strategies (e.g. climate change) were drafted. On the other hand, though, we should bear in mind that the Sixth Action Programme urges us to support sustainable production methods and consumption models by fiscal means.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although it is difficult to see this mid-term review as highly satisfactory, it is nevertheless the only mechanism through which the EU can effectively push for achievement of the goals set. A lack of achievement in this area would damage the credibility of the EU and of its Members who are genuinely concerned about the deteriorating state of the environment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Commission Communication regarding the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (EAP) confirms the fact that climate change, loss of biodiversity, health and use of resources represent the most pressing environmental challenges and, for this reason, it is essential for this programme to become an important instrument in the strategy for sustainable EU development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Taking into consideration the measures implemented so far by this programme, it is improbable for the priority environmental objectives to be achieved by 2012. For instance, the objective of stopping the loss of biodiversity by 2010 cannot be achieved, and the strategies proposed for protecting the marine environment and the soil will give no concrete results by 2012. At the same time, the actions taken to improve air quality, as well as those set in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution and the objectives regarding ambient noise reduction are not enough to achieve the EAP objectives. Neither the settlement of problems, nor the reticence of certain Member States toward the implementation of directives regarding the habitats and Natura 2000 are dealt adequately with in the Commission communication.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Once the N2000 sites are designated, it is necessary to formulate, promote and monitor the conservation objectives. This review calls attention to these problems and requests the Commission to aim at ambitious results in the field of environmental protection.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The next item is the report by Paul Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on support for research and development performing SMEs (COM(2007)0514 – C6-0281/2007 – 2007/0188(COD)) (A6-0064/2008).</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today we are dealing with the Commission proposal to support the Eurostars Joint Programme, and I thank you for giving me a few minutes to explain the key features and the importance of this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Eurostars Joint Programme aims to support research and development performing SMEs. These SMEs are able to bring new products and services onto the market thanks to their own research and development work. They have the ambition and the capacity to grow and to become the ‘stars’ of tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">A group of 29 EUREKA countries, and now Luxembourg, which has just applied to join, have decided to develop the Joint Programme, specifically designed to support SMEs undertaking their own research and development activities, in cooperation with their partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to enhance the impact of this initiative, the Commission has proposed to the European Parliament and the Council participating financially in the Eurostars Joint Programme, based on Article 169 of the Treaty, with an amount of up to EUR 100 million. This amount will leverage approximately EUR 300 million from the participating countries for the next six years.</p>
      <p sl="en">An essential aspect of this initiative is that the participating countries commit themselves to integrate their national programmes in order to create a joint European programme. In addition, Eurostars reinforces the cooperation between the Framework Programme and EUREKA. For these reasons, I think that this initiative is a further step towards the realisation of the European Research Area.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, and also to the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the good cooperation and the improvements they are proposing to the Commission proposal. On behalf of the Commission, I can inform you that we accept these proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly appreciate the fact that you agreed to handle this proposal swiftly, so that we will be able to contribute to the first Eurostars call. A rapid adoption by Parliament and the Council would indeed send a strong signal to the SME community that a continued investment in research and innovation activities is crucial to maintain and enhance their competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="en">Eurostars should be a good example of how Member States can cooperate by bringing their national programmes closer together, and of where Community funding results in more impact for the programme, for the benefit of the European SME community and, of course, for the benefit of Europe as such.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Slovenian Presidency, too, as it has done everything it can right up until the last minute to ensure that this programme is able to be implemented on time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should also like to thank all my fellow Members, of course, because we have demonstrated once again here how effective European legislation can actually be. When you think that the report was only introduced in January and that tomorrow we shall be voting on it, then you see that this House, the Presidency and the Commission are able to work together very effectively. We can be extremely proud of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as it is not easy to negotiate a relatively complex matter in such a short space of time, to prepare and implement the basic principles accordingly. We are very happy that Slovakia, the United Kingdom and – at the last minute – Luxemburg, which we did not know about until yesterday, have expressed a wish to join this programme in recent weeks. I shall also be tabling an oral amendment on this tomorrow, and I would ask the Presidency that Luxembourg therefore be considered tomorrow when the Member States are named, so that small and medium-sized enterprises in Luxemburg, too, are able to take part in this programme successfully.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the negotiations, we in Parliament have been emphasising a transparent and above all unbureaucratic, but efficient programme for promoting research. This should also, in particular, make possible our very earnest wish for one-off payments to be made and quick decisions taken, so that enterprises raise the funds needed to carry out research activities and do not take out a bank loan in advance, and then often have to wait a very long time for the money.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe, Commissioner Potočnik, that this programme is a sign of better regulation, that we have really succeeded here in implementing the objectives concerning SMEs and better regulation under the Seventh Framework Research Programme appropriately. Participation and management by Eureka is also exemplary, as Eureka is able to make very efficient and rapid decisions on this as well as ultimately bearing a large share of the responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Community ultimately provides up to one third of the support. Commissioner, as you have already said, we are talking about up to EUR 100 million. New to the programme is also the fact that this is a genuine bottom-up programme, and therefore comes from the business community, from the small, research-intensive or medium-sized enterprises. I am actually proud of the fact that the Eurostat Secretariat in Brussels is operating on the market here very efficiently and very quickly in close cooperation with the national funding agencies, and that it is therefore also becoming possible to focus on market-oriented research activities aiming at short- and medium-term commercial results.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a key element of the work of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it should be cost-effective. High costs should not be incurred in the process for either the enterprises or the authorities; instead, everything should be clearly and coherently worded in order that each individual enterprise is also able to respond to the questions asked as part of its activities without a huge outlay. We have recently checked this. It has been a great success.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Paul Rübig, on his report and I would like to thank him for having agreed to present an oral amendment to include Luxembourg in this programme and to thereby remedy the administrative dawdling that caused its absence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have known, Commissioner, at least since the first evaluation report on the Lisbon process, that SMEs play an essential role in the field of research and innovation. However, their level of participation is not yet meet expectations and the latest investment figures are proof of this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This special programme should therefore facilitate the participation of SMEs, and also reduce any excessive bureaucracy. In fact, in some ways it is a matter of setting things straight, covering the risk and counteracting the hesitancy of companies when it comes to investing in research and innovation, which is perhaps also an evil of the European corporate mindset.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I congratulate our rapporteur for insisting on adoption at the first reading, which should accelerate the implementation of this programme, guarantee its effectiveness and prove that European legislation is perhaps not as cumbersome as people sometimes accuse it of being, but that it can act effectively in the interest of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Madam President. Commissioner, thank you for attending this debate. I would also firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.</p>
      <p sl="es">For some time now, in various forums and also in Parliament, the possible relationship between the Community Framework Programme and the EUREKA intergovernmental programme has been the subject of analysis and debate, as both involve considerable aid to SMEs. The result of these synergies has been Community funding for the Eurostars programme, on the basis of Article 169 of the Treaty, a programme that complements the Framework Programme through what I understand to be the main virtues of EUREKA: its bottom-up structure, which enables better adaptation to the needs of SMEs and facilitates participation, given that the bureaucracy required in order to participate in the Framework Programme is, in many cases, an excessive burden that is impossible for many SMEs to bear.</p>
      <p sl="es">Supporting greater integration of SMEs into R&amp;D is something that Parliament has always advocated, and Eurostars can have a considerable mobilising impact. We therefore especially welcome this initiative.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mr Rübig has – as usual – presented an excellent report. Congratulations to him.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is a very important subject, since the introduction of research results into industrial and business practice may be relatively promptly facilitated via SMEs. This is a fundamental aspect of the Lisbon Strategy. It is consequently a good thing that the Eurostars programme builds on the 7th Framework Programme for transnational enterprises and finances work in the sphere of science and technology put into effect by SMEs in cooperation with higher education institutions, research entities and other companies – large ones.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The direction of research is also important; it should be pro-market and have practical applications that are as prompt as possible. This good idea, which supports business initiatives and should be free of bureaucracy and clear, including its financial aspects. This is important for all partners, especially for business people. The success of this programme will set a good example for the future. Let us hope that our one hundred million euros are not wasted.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Small and medium-sized enterprises provide 70% of jobs in the European Union. That said, these enterprises invest only 4% in science, research and technological development, which is without any doubt the reason why they do not make better use of their business potential. We need to develop the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises within the framework of the renewed Lisbon Strategy. There are several ways to do this: give them better access to information, offer them better credit conditions, enable them to cooperate better with the public sector and help them to improve ties with large businesses so that both small and big systems are mutually linked. I think that this is feasible and can be achieved in a relatively short period of time.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the EU extends its reach into more and more areas. The problem is that there is no principle for deciding what the EU should do. A sound principle is the one paid lip-service in policy speeches but ignored in decision-making: the subsidiarity principle. That argues against centralising research and development, except as regards very large-scale projects on the lines of Galileo or fusion energy. Research and development bureaucratised in large organisations gives less return on the money put in, not more. There is seldom any reason for Member States to send money to Brussels and then have their researchers ask for it back later. This assessment is particularly valid when it comes to research and development for small and medium-sized businesses. The enthusiasm shown by researchers and businesses comes from the fact that they are conned into thinking that more funds will be available overall. There is nothing to indicate that this is the case. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="sk">First of all, allow me to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this report. I think that thanks mainly to Mr Rübig this Parliament has managed to find a compromise that is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and should result in adoption of this proposal at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that the EUREKA initiative concerning a research and development programme for small and medium-sized enterprises is very much welcomed by the business community. The fact that so many countries participate in this initiative confirms that prior to this programme there had been a lack of interest in solving the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In spite of the European Parliament’s efforts, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development has not solved the problem of how SMEs approach the funds provided to support their research, development and innovation activities either. It is thus extremely encouraging to see that this bottom-up initiative has met with so much approval in all the relevant European institutions. Although there is no doubt that some progress has been made, the fact is that some questions still remain unanswered. I am thinking here of the eligibility criteria for the SMEs, in particular the proportion of time and annual turnover dedicated to research activities.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Personally, I am of the opinion that when setting these criteria we should be more broadminded and consider opening the Eurostars programme up to smaller enterprises with substantial innovation and development potential in spite of their size.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion I want to say how pleased I am that my country, Slovakia, is also involved in the cooperation: this should improve the situation of small and medium-sized innovative enterprises whose development has to some extent been lagging behind until now.</p>

      <p sl="ro">First of all, I congratulate Rapporteur Rübig and I would like to specify certain elements. For the economic competitiveness of the European Union, it is essential to support small and medium-sized enterprises investing in applied research.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The 22 Member States and the 5 states in Eureka that have decided to invest, together with the Commission, the 400 million euros to support the research carried out by small businesses, contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We should not forget that the SMEs represent 99% of the total European enterprises. The selection of projects to be financed by the Eurostars programme shall be made according to the scientific excellence and economic impact.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, I call attention to the difficulty that small and medium-sized enterprises meet in ensuring the co-financing of 50% of a project’s value.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Many of the small enterprises would rather assign their specialists to projects bringing rapid income, to the detriment of long-term research programmes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Also, the financing of small businesses based on a business plan might determine a very large number of SMEs participating in the European research.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that, during this programme, the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs will also continue.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is extremely important to support small and medium-sized enterprises as well as to stimulate their scientific and technological development. SMEs need a solid technological base to enable them to boost their contribution to economic growth and development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a rule SMEs have a great capacity for initiative and adaptability since they are not stifled by bureaucracy and are normally run by entrepreneurs and managers who are highly committed to their work of wealth creation. That capacity for initiative and adaptability makes it easier to launch new business ventures involving the manufacture and/or sale of new products or the operation of new services tailored to the needs of consumers or other businesses.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Such new products and services could frequently require a more solid technological base than is available in many such small enterprises, therefore the Eurostars joint research and development programme aimed at supporting SMEs could be very important because of its potential impact on the ‘real economy’. It will thus help to improve the skills of small and medium-sized enterprises in various European States, serving citizens as consumers as well as the European economy. It will thus also help to create more and better jobs. For all those reasons Mr Rübig’s report has been most useful.</p>

      <p sl="ro">First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Rübig for the correct and rapid way in which he managed this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This report creates a premise for a new approach of the Lisbon Strategy by simply relating research to SMEs. Thus, we give a new value to competitiveness and a new boost to start-ups, SMEs with innovative activity. Eurostars should become the starting point for relaunching the European economic activity, a programme of European innovative stars, a transparent, flexible and non-bureaucratic programme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I end by requesting the Commission, together with all the states participating in this programme, to encourage and promote this programme closely related to the European priority themes: climate change, energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy resources and, last but not least, the fight against cancer.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Eurostars joint research and development programme supports research and development-performing SMEs in executing market-oriented research in transnational projects, implemented on behalf of various SME associations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to stress in particular the importance of the transfer of knowledge and the need for cooperation within the framework of this programme between enterprises themselves and with other institutions, based on industrial and economic partnerships. The fact that this is a bottom-up programme, directly adapted to the needs of research-performing enterprises that participate in it, is a very positive aspect. The key issue is that the research activities are market-oriented and aimed at short to medium-term commercial results.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also want to mention a new feature of this programme: namely the introduction of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility designed for more risky RTD projects.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you very much, Mr President. I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Potočnik and Mr Rübig. The Eurostars Joint Programme is an excellent means of achieving the Lisbon goals, of enhancing competitiveness, and of strengthening innovation. Research and development SMEs that spend at least 10% of their turnover on research and development are key players in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungary is a member of this programme, and interest in it has been enormous. More than 200 businesses fulfilling the criteria have applied, although a problem now emerging is that Member States have not set aside adequate resources. In Hungary, for example, only EUR 500 000 are available, sufficient for only 2-3 projects. Consequently, I think the Member States should at all events increase the resources allocated for this, or try to spend at least 3% of GDP on research and development so that we can be competitive at world-class level too. I believe that Eurostars and EUREKA are the kind of programmes that provide an excellent means of achieving this. Congratulations again.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, simply put, it pays to invest in small businesses.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Scientific studies have shown that small businesses with simple technologies have room for good innovations, and I would very much like to emphasise this. This is also the case with family firms, in which investment is made in one child in the given firm’s line, so there is a certain continuity, and I consider this to be a very sound way of going on. Moreover, these firms are highly flexible, and for a small outlay are capable of moving from one place to another, and also from one product to another; I believe, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that if more than 60% of income in the EU comes from SMEs, it would be a major error on our part to skimp on investment in them and their development.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-225" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking everybody not only for supporting the proposal in the report but also, and even more, for supporting the SMEs. SMEs are a vital part of the European economy and here, as I have already said, in the Eurostars programme we are talking about SMEs which will be the ‘stars’ of the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an innovative approach. It is not easy to implement approaches where we combine money from the Member States with Community funding, but it is definitely worthwhile, because that is exactly the direction in which we should go in the future. We are joining the best of EUREKA – flexibility, simplicity, decentralised approach, market orientation – with the best of the Framework Programme: centralised management, common evaluation and common selection. I can assure you that also in the other parts of the Framework Programme we are keeping our eyes very much open for the benefit of the SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Simplification is the name of the game, so we have introduced, as you are probably aware, a higher funding rate for SMEs than for the rest. So they have a 75% co-funding rate in the Framework Programme, while the rest of the bigger companies have 50%, which means that we are stimulating their participation. We have introduced a guarantee fund, which very much simplifies their participation in the Framework Programme, because the fact that they have to submit some bank guarantees in advance was one of the major problems for SMEs; and we are also about to introduce a ‘unique registration facility’ which will again ease the job because you will have to apply only once and all your data will be stored and the next time you apply this will be done automatically.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, if we look at the results of the first year – and as you know, we agreed about the target of 15% funding which should go to SMEs from the cooperation part of the programme – we can say that it is working. While in Framework Programme 6 we were not achieving the target, from the first evaluations and first insight into the results, we can see that this figure is closer to 20% than 15%, which is a major step forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also working in the Commission. I have just come from a meeting of the competitiveness group where we discussed the Small Business Act – that is the working title – where we want to address all the issues connected with SMEs in an organised way. I would also like to mention that, although today we are deciding about financial participation from the Community side, in fact this has already begun, and more than 200 have applied for the first call, which is an important success.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I should like to mention that I am extremely glad that Luxembourg has decided to join. There is definitely no problem in substance. We should all do our best to make its accession to the programme as quick as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, in summary we can say that we have again set ourselves an objective here that focuses on the Lisbon Agenda. Implementation of research results in the short-term will, we hope, create new jobs and lead to higher net wages. Of course, an essential feature of innovation is that new products are offered, and thus also success is achieved on the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am also pleased that, together with the European Investment Bank, we have succeeded in providing an additional instrument for risk sharing, and that these sums can therefore be spread significantly further. We have also devised an evaluation in order to see whether the funds are actually being claimed and check that the European Parliament is not having to make cutbacks again on account of the funds not being completely exhausted in the previous year, as happens with other programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe this programme can ensure that the funds are exhausted, and I would ask my fellow Members to ensure in the Member States, too, that cofinancing works as intended. It is in the interest of all of us that the take-up of this programme be good. I believe that it should also be communicated accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also ask Commissioner Potočnik to arrange with Commission Vice-President Wallström for this programme to be presented to the public as exemplary: this is part of the process. I should like once again to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency: this is a product and a project that is really worth showing off.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner Potočnik, talking about the role of SMEs is the done thing in this House. Indeed, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the EU economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Germany alone, almost 20 million people are working, researching and developing in more than 3.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises. Whether Europe grows or stagnates mainly depends on them. Small and medium-sized enterprises produce more patents, innovations and jobs than the large conglomerates. Yet the SMEs continue to have too little access to loans and funding programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Eurostars is a good example of how things work. Unlike the Seventh Framework Programme, which is based on a top-down approach with central funding by the EU, Eureka and Eurostars are bottom-up approaches. The programmes are managed by the Eureka Initiative. This is a good thing, and could also perhaps be a model for our Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
      <p sl="de">The advantages of the Eurostars programme are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="de">• research-intensive SME required in leadership role</p>
      <p sl="de">• eligibility checking and evaluation by international experts</p>
      <p sl="de">• harmonised invitations to tender and workflows in all Member States</p>
      <p sl="de">• fast decision making regarding funding: 14 weeks after the cut-off date</p>
      <p sl="de">• the Commission awards additional top-up</p>
      <p sl="de">• funding exclusively in the form of non-repayable grants (cash allowance)</p>

      <p sl="sk">By voting for Paul Rübig’s report, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States. Small and medium-sized enterprises can often be effective participants in research and development but they have to put up with less favourable conditions than those that apply to large international corporations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">From now on, SME associations performing research and development can avail of financial support from Europe and operate within a European network together with other small and medium-sized enterprises. Slovak SMEs will thus be able to contribute their knowledge and capacities to the European research and development sector.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In Slovakia many small and medium-sized enterprises are located in rural areas with less developed infrastructure, which hampers their development. Many women are employed in research and development performing SMEs, whether directly or indirectly. European funds are useful because they give SMEs a start, thus allowing their professional capacities to serve the common interest.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Eurostars programme is a programme for researching and developing new products and services at European Union level. SMEs play a key role in Eurostars projects. It is a real pity that the Slovak Republic, an EU Member State, does not participate in this programme. Slovakia’s small and medium-sized enterprises consequently have no access to the significant financial support available for the effective development of new products, techniques and services.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament, and particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Gierek, for the interest and support shown regarding the Research Fund for Coal and Steel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler, and the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Laperrouze and Mr Březina, for their constructive help. I understand that the request for a debate was made by a number of members of the ITRE Committee. I am therefore more than happy to summarise what is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2002, a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice created the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, a smart financial design using the interest accrued from the assets made available at the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Treaty. Activities under that Treaty were funded through a levy paid by the coal and steel industries, 27.2% and 72.8% of the budget being respectively allocated to coal and steel.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through a bottom-up approach, this Research Fund is intended exclusively to fund research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industries, two major traditional sectors where research is still needed: firstly, to comply with current EU policies on environmental standards to combat global climate change and, secondly, to maintain energy security of supply by having a fuel mix that meets European demand.</p>
      <p sl="en">The essential principles and proper decision-making procedures related to the management of this fund are defined in the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. These technical guidelines are to be reviewed or supplemented every five years, the first period ending on 31 December 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 10 July 2007, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the revision of these technical guidelines. This proposed revision looked to further the positive results achieved during the first five years of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel research programme, notably in terms of environmental protection. In the Commission’s view, no major overhaul was needed, but rather a fine tuning of the existing rules in order to adapt the guidelines to EU enlargement, to the Seventh Framework Programme and to current European regulations, notably in terms of gender balance and financial management policies. This proposal for a Council decision was sent to the European Parliament for consultation, and this is the reason why we are here today.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that Mr Gierek’s report by and large supports the Commission’s proposal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Commission’s decision regarding the continued functioning of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel should be received with satisfaction. This fund arose as a payment of 72.8% made by the steel industry and 27.2% made by the coal industry following the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. The interest from this Fund amounts to around EUR 60 million a year, which makes it possible to provide top-up subsidies for research that does not come under the 7th Framework Programme. This concerns essential research for rationalisation of the functioning of both the iron and steel industry and coal mining, as well as research leading to further improvements in finished product quality in this industry, that is to say coal and steel. The need for such research activities is particularly relevant to these industries in the new countries of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Steel. Steel is still the most important construction material. The technological potential to raise the quality of various grades of steel and improvements in the efficiency of steel production are still far from exhausted, particularly where new technologies for the production of intermediate products for subsequent machining are concerned. Increased reliability of steel structures and increased operating efficiency of various items of machinery and equipment require considerable volumes of empirical research in this sphere. This also applies to improvements in chemical composition, and to improvements in the functional properties of various steel grades. Work on an effective and environmentally sound method of recycling scrap, e.g. steel from problematic galvanised automobile industry scrap, is also of exceptional importance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Coal. Coal means energy security. The competitiveness of this solid fuel, the definition of which, according to the proposal made in this regulation, is to be expanded for practical purposes to include bitumen shales, also known as oil shales, which are mined in Estonia, depends on efficient utilisation of its regional reserves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The specific problems of coal mining depend to a large extent on local geological conditions and require routine surveying work. These studies should precede the construction and operation of, for example, deep coking coal mines with a methane problem. Coal utilisation can also include the non-conventional method of its underground gasification. The continued proper functioning of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel requires that each advisory group include in its make-up experts able to guarantee optimal representation from the aspect of the location of the coal and steel industry in the European Union, with particular regard to experts from the new European Union countries.</p>

      <p sl="cs">After a period of five years, in accordance with the Council guidelines, the European Commission reviewed the operation of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. This Fund manages the assets of the now expired European Coal and Steel Community and invests the interest generated by the capital in coal and steel research.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I welcome the fact that the Commission’s proposal consistently reflects the changes that have taken place over the last five years, takes account of the provisions laid down in the Accession Treaties at the time of 2004 enlargement of the EU (one specific example already mentioned is Estonia’s Treaty of Accession), incorporates the fact that the definition of the term ‘coal’ is now broader, and focuses in particular on job protection and on effective use of materials and energy resources in production and manufacturing industries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The provisions dealing with amendments to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development and to those areas that the Seventh Framework Programme does not cover in detail are also an important part of the proposal. In addition to the Commission’s proposal itself, I would like to praise the work of the rapporteur, Adam Gierek, and his report. The results of the vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which adopted all the substantive amendments, are a testament to the excellent groundwork and sensible approach to further investment in science and research in the area of coal and steel, two raw materials for energy and production that are currently irreplaceable.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to reject unambiguously the proposals by certain groups aimed at undermining the importance of coal and steel and conventional energy sources in general, or, as the case may be, the importance of the future of this Fund, which has proved to be irreplaceable in terms of financing research. Coal and steel are among the most important raw materials for energy and manufacturing that have developed significantly in recent years. The report should thus take into account, for example, the geographical location of reserves: this will contribute towards more effective energy use and better energy security in the European Union as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Research Fund for Coal and Steel was established after the expiration of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the first treaty upon the foundation of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Europe possesses important coal deposits, but we need to invest in new, cleaner processing solutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Steel is a product still used by many industrial sectors, but research is necessary in this sector as well in order to identify cleaner and more efficient solutions from the energy point of view.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The importance of this research is even greater since the two sectors entail a large number of jobs that must be kept and whose working conditions need to be improved.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This research should also result in better working conditions for the employees of the two sectors.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In Romania, approximately 34 million tons of coal are extracted every year and approximately 8 million tons of steel are produced.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In these two industrial sectors, the number of directly or indirectly employed people is several hundred thousand. This is why I believe this document is extremely important.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research efforts in the steel sector are necessary to protect the European steel industry and therefore the European economy. However, my approach to the coal industry is more guarded.</p>
      <p sl="fr">James Hansen, climatologist and research director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, recently declared that the scale of climate change had been underestimated but that we have various tools at our disposal, one of which is the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2030. One gas-fired power station emits between 300 and 400 kilograms of CO2 per megawatt-hour, a latest generation coal-fired power station emits 800 kilograms and a power station running on lignite emits 1 000 kilograms of CO2 .</p>
      <p sl="fr">How consistent is the European Union being if, on the one hand, it is developing an ambitious plan to combat and adapt to climate change and, on the other, it is supporting coal as a clean energy source?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Humanity has gone from the wood age to the coal age, then to the oil age. Today, Parliament has the choice of supporting a return to the coal age or being consistent with the climate package and therefore not establishing coal as a clean energy source. For this reason my Group intends to support some of the amendments by the Verts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, allow me to give you a wonderful quote from Alphonse Karr: ‘A lover is almost always a man who, having found a glowing coal, puts it in his pocket believing it to be a diamond.’ Love is indeed passion. For energy, let us opt for reason instead.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who championed the irrelevant amendments in committee. Yet in line with what Mrs Laperrouze said about coal, it is not at all clear to me why the Commission should stipulate subsidising coal ad infinitum , as it were.</p>
      <p sl="de">Coal has been subsidised to an unbelievable extent for 50 years, and continuing this is contrary to all the EU’s statements on climate policy. We believe that, on the contrary, these coal subsidies should be replaced with more consistent support for renewable energies and energy efficiency. Otherwise Europe will not be in a position to meet its targets on climate policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Steel is another story. Yet the Commission has omitted to make it clear that steel continues to be subsidised and coal does not. In my opinion sufficient provision has already been made for coal, a dirty energy source, in the Seventh Framework Research Programme.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, coal and steel were central at the start of the European Union, and still are, albeit as part of a completely different agenda involving globalisation, climate change and energy issues. It is ‘all hands on deck’, as it were; the input of this fund, however small, contributes to the technological revolution necessary to keep the steel sector competitive and to make coal a clean fuel, a clean raw material: ‘clean coal’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Commission has also opted for this, on the eve of our pilot projects to achieve carbon capture and storage, for example as a technological innovation. I am emphatically in favour of this. I am not in favour of closing; I am in favour of keeping open. For example, NUON, a Dutch electricity company, is envisaging in Groningen a coal gasifier involving complete capture etc. This kind of project requires support and more resources than are currently on the table.</p>
      <p sl="nl">More important – as Commissioner Potočnik knows – is my plea for a better combination of funds, Structural Funds, input from the European Investment Bank, etc. More matching, bundling, is required to enable major research into infrastructure and investment. The existing rule ‘one fund, one project’ is a definite hindrance. We must also tinker with these rules, and fortunately the European Commission is already testing the boundaries in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On 5 and 6 March we spoke in Brdo, Slovenia, about more focus and bundling of European projects. This summer, the Commission will be presenting a new profile for the Esprit programme, to achieve more targeted investment. This is what we want to hear about, not the phasing-out of coal. That is indeed the wrong course to take.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gierek on his report.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, a research programme that manages its own resources outside the Seventh Framework Programme and that has an annual budget of EUR 60 million cannot but be well received and supported by Parliament, especially taking into account that steel is still used a great deal in various sectors of industry and that there are still many scientific and technological challenges to overcome in order to make production processes cleaner and more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to coal, the challenges are even greater due to its implications for energy production and for achieving our objectives for combating climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">Making coal more competitive in the energy market, improving the safety and operating capacity of the mines and achieving cleaner combustion requires R&amp;D, and the new technologies for capturing and storing CO2 are an area of research that the European Union has clearly backed. I therefore fully agree with the content of this report.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Starting from the immediate political priorities of the European Union, I would like to emphasize some budgetary aspects of this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission’s proposal refers to the Green Paper on energy and the objective specified in it to increase the use of coal as an important source of energy, by using clean technologies, of reducing and storing carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The actions that could receive European financing from the Research Fund for Coal and Steel include pilot projects and projects demonstrating the latest technologies in this field.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The problem is the extremely low budget allocated to this fund: 57 million euros every year. It is difficult for me to imagine how this amount could cover a significant number of projects throughout the territory of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I remind you that more than one quarter of the European Union countries continue to meet their energy needs by using coal as the main source.</p>
      <p sl="ro">From this point of view, I believe greater financial involvement from the European Union is necessary in this sector, both by way of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, and by the programmes of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I believe Europe’s economic power relies on having the best steel at the lowest costs, therefore the results coming from common research should be shared at the Community level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In many European countries, there are regions that depend mostly on coal and steel production. The conversion of the labour force employed in coal and steel production is still unsolved and, unfortunately, the regions in question have entered the category of regions with problems in the standard of living and need cohesion programmes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I appreciate the comments which support the proposal as much as I appreciate also the comments which called for a view of how we will approach energy and climate change solutions in the future. I must make it clear that today we are talking about additional funding for R&amp;D based on an existing fund, based on a protocol – to be more precise, we talk about the technical guidelines. I believe that it is better that this money is used for research and development rather than for anything else, because it is true that in energy and climate change there is no room for complacency.</p>
      <p sl="en">CCS is one of the activities which will also be addressed, but it is far from being the real answer. So the real questions, and the real debate about the issues which you opened today, will come when we discuss the strategy for the energy technology plan – how to approach this, how to act in the future, and how to find the right answers. In this respect, it will be extremely important that we are aware that ‘business as usual’ is not an option. We lack human resources and we lack funding. The Framework Programme is only partially a solution for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will have to address that issue seriously because we need to look at it both from a short-term point of view, looking for possible solutions to fill the gap where the need is urgent, and at the same time for long-term solutions. Such solutions are very much needed and we must concentrate on renewables from today onwards. So I think that will be when we have to discuss that. Do not forget that the financing of energy in 1980 was approximately four times higher in Europe than it is today. So approaching these problems as though business as usual could continue would be another illusion. Do not make that mistake.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I am perhaps taking up just one issue that has been raised here today, namely the view that mines should be closed as soon as possible for environmental reasons. I think that energy security, for example in my country, in the Czech Republic and in many other EU countries, is not consistent with this view, and this view is not generally accepted. Quite the contrary, in fact: if only because of new technologies that are being developed, such as ‘clean coal’ and ‘CCS’, we shall probably be opening new mines in the future. Coal will continue to be an important and competitive source of energy in Europe for some time to come. We must also not forget – and here I am addressing those who would like to close all mines – that coal is not only an important raw material for energy, but also a chemical raw material.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, then, the Research Fund for Coal and Steel is necessary. Secondly, this Fund is not met by the 7th Framework Programme, as it deals with an entirely different sphere of action. Thirdly, a rise in qualified costs from 40% to 50% is indicated. Fourthly, failure to include bitumen shales in the Research Fund for Coal and Steel programme – and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also put forward a proposal of this nature for these amendments – would have been injurious to Estonia, whose power generation is chiefly based on this fuel.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In Poland, 95% of electricity comes from coal-fired power stations. Consequently Poland is particularly interested in new technologies for coal utilisation that improve efficiency in power stations, reduce CO2 emissions and enable coal to be converted into hydrocarbon fuels with restricted CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">New technologies open up the possibility of utilising nuclear reactors as emission-free heat sources to achieve the stated aims of the coal industry.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to implement the synergy between coal and nuclear energy, however, we need high-temperature reactors (HTRs). In Europe, research into high-temperature reactors has been going on for some years now. Unfortunately there is not a single European research centre working on HTRs that might have the goal of introducing a coal-nuclear synergy programme. Such a centre would enhance Europe technologically, including the coal industry. It could also do much to support the acceptance of nuclear power in Europe through direct cooperation with the coal industry, striving to modernise it and not competing with it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bearing in mind the importance of coal in the Polish energy sector, it would appear to make sense to set up such a European centre in Poland. Without decisive action, we shall lose the technology race in this sphere against the United States, South Africa, China and South Korea.</p>

      <p sl="et">Under the Protocol to the Nice Treaty on the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel all assets of the ECSC were placed at the disposal of the European Commission in 2002. The revenue from these assets is to be used for research in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry. The Council has adopted two regulations to improve implementation of the research programme: a financial regulation and a technical regulation. The Gierek report concerns the latter.</p>
      <p sl="et">Under the Treaty of Accession of Estonia to the EU, oil shales were given the status of coal. As a result, the European Commission proposed that the Council should make the technical guidelines for the research programme on coal and steel consistent with the Treaty and included oil shales in the definition of coal under the technical guidelines. As a result, Estonian research into oil shales is eligible to apply for funding under the research programme on the same basis as coal.</p>
      <p sl="et">The Polish rapporteur, Adam Gierek, has proposed replacing ‘oil shales’ in the definition with ‘bitumen shales’, on the ground that the term ‘bitumen shales’ also covers ‘oil shales’. In fact, the opposite is true: ‘oil shales’ is a broader term than ‘bitumen shales’. The Greens have made a proposal to remove oil shales from the definition of coal completely. Once again I draw your attention to the fact that when it acceded to the EU, Estonia agreed that oil shales were to have the status of coal and therefore the basis of funding for the oil shales research programme must be the same as that of the research fund for coal and steel.</p>

      <p sl="en">I was Parliamentary rapporteur when discharge was being granted for the last time in respect of the European Coal and Steel Community’s activities. The funds in the expired Community were accumulated from the coal and steel industries, and so it is only fair that any money left over should go on research in these sectors and not be used to cover research in the oil industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Research and research institutions are needed if we are to use emission-free or ‘clean’ coal. This includes carbon capture and storage (CSS), although there is not enough money in this fund to finance this, despite the huge need. It is interesting that today by chance Shell happened to call for public funding, meaning EU funding, for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Gierek, as rapporteur, is clearly tending to promote the use of coal in energy production, and he represents the best interests of his country in this. Moreover, it is not forbidden in the EU, but there is still a long way to go before we have clean coal.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0063/2008) by Guy Bono, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on cultural industries in Europe (2007/2153(INI)).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-252" speaker_id="28140" name="Guy BONO" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="France" birth_date="30-04-1953" birth_place="Béjà " p_group="Socialist Group in the European Parliament" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the report I am presenting follows on from the request made by Mrs Trüpel - who is here today and whom I welcome - and I, at the time of the 2007 Culture report three years ago, for greater recognition of the cultural industries, which I recall are now larger than the automotive industry in the European Union, accounting for 3.1% of the active population of the European Union and generating 2.6% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have therefore prepared this report by consulting as much as possible with all those involved in the sector. Consequently I would like to thank all the experts and professionals from the industry, as well as web user and consumer associations and finally my colleagues in the Committee on Culture for all the discussions we have been able to hold on these crucial issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report is based on the following postulate: culture and the economy have today become inseparable. The economy needs culture and culture needs the economy. In view of this, culture urgently needs to be restored to its rightful place on the Lisbon agenda. With this in mind, I make a number of proposals in this report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first would be to set up a task force to explore the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the context of Community policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, it is essential make more room in our Community funding for the cultural industries. In this report, at the level of the Member States I recommend private/public funding as well as the promotion of a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours cultural industries, and more specifically the application of tax credits and reduced rates of VAT to all cultural products, including online works. I also call upon the Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a programme similar to the MEDIA programme for all the cultural industries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, this report proposes that culture be better incorporated into the European Union’s external policies because – and I want to stress this – what makes Europe so rich is its culture or rather, as I should have said, the diversity of its culture. I therefore invite the Commission and the Member States to increase the amount of aid for translation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, if you will allow me Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of intellectual property rights, which are the subject of a great number of amendments in this report. On this subject, I strongly oppose the position of some Member States whose repressive measures are dictated by industries incapable of changing their economic model in line with the needs imposed by the information society. Cutting off internet access is a disproportionate measure in view of the objectives. This is a penalty with powerful effects, which could have serious repercussions in a society where internet access is essential for social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to make a distinction between mass piracy and consumers acting without a profit motive. Rather than criminalising consumers, we need to set up new economic models that strike a balance between the ability to access cultural activities and content, cultural diversity and genuine remuneration for those who hold intellectual property rights. It seems to me that this is the only way cultural Europe can truly enter the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am happy to be here for the debate on Mr Bono’s report and I should like to thank him for his contribution and the committee for its work. I am sure, as he said, that culture is important to our lives and it is more and more central to the future of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to add that it defines our Community much more than business or geography. We also need to understand that culture makes a contribution; culture creates; culture is something positive, not consuming our budgets or conflicting with our needs but bringing a lot of enrichment, including jobs and growth. This was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year’s summit conclusions, in the study we presented some time ago, and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline just three specific ideas or items from your report, because there are many and I will not comment on all of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, you ask us to establish a European vision of culture, creativity and innovation. The European agenda we have now agreed does exactly that. We are strengthening the cooperation between Member States, including the promotion of creative industries. This is one of three pillars. Part of that work will need to look at how to measure more accurately the contribution these industries make to the economy and how best to support them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, you ask us to look at the external dimension. This is one of the three priorities of the agenda and we are very active now in encouraging our partners, our Member States, to ratify the UNESCO Convention – because not all Member States and also other countries in the world have done so – and also in ensuring its implementation. And we are increasingly including cultural elements both in our development cooperation and in our bilateral relations with emerging economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, I agree with you that full attention has to be paid to implementing Article 151 fully in EU policies. I have established really good contacts and cooperation with my colleagues, including Commissioner McCreevy on the internal market, on the various aspects of copyright protection. I am confident that, with the help of all of you, we will achieve the objectives laid down in this Treaty article.</p>
      <p sl="en">You also mention the mobility of artists and cultural workers, which is very high on our agenda, especially this year. Member States have already constituted a working group on this topic and the Commission is implementing the pilot action on the mobility of artists proposed by this Parliament last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will support all these efforts, in particular with a study to better understand the links between culture, creativity and innovation, as well as another study on how to have an environment conducive to the development of creative and cultural industries, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises and risk-taking.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results of these initiatives will feed into a Green Paper on cultural and creative industries, which the Commission plans to publish in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am looking forward to the debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new technologies are gaining ever greater weight in Europe’s cultural industry. Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property.</p>
      <p sl="de">The task of the European Union, and of the Member States, should be to provide the necessary resources to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected and protected. Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard. All those involved should be aware of their rights and obligations regarding a common solution to this task.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its report, our committee has argued in favour of awareness-raising and education campaigns, particularly with regard to consumers. Preparatory and education measures explaining the value of intellectual property should start among young people in schools. In this context I should like to emphasise once again the committee’s opinion that criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combating digital piracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have repeatedly emphasised that free information structures such as the World Wide Web are of great significance to the European creative sector and that we have to strike a balance between the openness of the Internet and the protection of intellectual property. In this context, Mr President, allow me one final comment on the revised version of Amendment 22a tabled by 40 Members. My group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – has clearly stated that it is prepared to support the first part of the amendment, and to emphatically reject the second part of this amendment.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when traditional economic sectors and industries are suffering from a significant downturn, and the pressures of globalisation are putting European businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage, the sector of cultural industries is one of the few to offer considerable possibilities for multi-faceted economic, regional, social and cultural development. At this stage, over and above Article 157 of the Treaty and the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, Europe must aim at an appropriate balance to help businesses, agencies, production and services in this sector to be fully competitive. At the same time, Europe must not put its distinct cross-cultural nature at risk or endanger diversity.</p>
      <p sl="el">For this reason, Commissioner, during the coming year, which is the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, as you have said yourself, I think that it is the right time for the EU to turn actively towards the cultural industries. We must get away from the perception that they are a luxury, but make specific policies to boost investment in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">Madam President, we fully support Mr Bono’s report, which I think will also be seriously examined by Commissioner Figeľ, so that he can discuss and continue his creative work.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we often encounter cases where the role and significance of culture are neglected. Business gets noticed, but culture is seen as something incidental, a sort of add-on. Not only is the cultural significance of culture underrated, but also its economic and social significance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thanks to this report, we are presented with a different image of culture. Let us please just look at the numbers. The European Union has at its disposal 1% of the GDP of all Member States, while the culture industry alone provides 2.6% of GDP and over 3% of employment, so this is a very important problem. These data are incomplete, though. We know that they do not include the role and significance of crafts, handicrafts and artistic work, and they also fail to include numerous areas that are influenced by culture. I therefore consider this report to be a very important one, and we should continue this work and get involved, and support Commissioner Figel’, because he has adopted a very good course – one which offers everyone an opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rigid debate between the concept of culture as purely an end in itself on the one hand and the total ‘marketisation’ of culture on the other is forced open by the Bono report. We are emphasising the significance of the creative industries as part of the Lisbon Strategy for economic growth without at the same time subjecting cultural policy to purely economic constraints.</p>
      <p sl="en">The creative and cultural industries are seen as independent economic sectors, and they have been the driving force for jobs in Europe in recent years. In Germany, for example, they are creating more jobs than the car industry, and the European Union and the Member States must orient their policy accordingly. There is a great deal still to do in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also like to emphasise once again – in the face of all the complicated arguments surrounding copyright – that the appropriate political rules still have to be found for the products of intellectual property in the digital world, to ensure open access to the Internet for private end-users on the one hand and create new income opportunities for artists who produce creative content on the other.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Mr Bono’s report is an excellent document which we support. I shall be brief and restrict my remarks to the question of copyright. In the pre-digital world purchases of books and records could be regarded as a reflection of normal consumer trends. Photocopiers and cassette recorders dealt a blow to authors’ remuneration and yet purchase continued to be the rule.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With the digital world comes a paradigm shift. The Internet means that the sharing and free circulation of ideas, information and works have cast off their old physical restraints. In this world payment is a thing of the past. The free circulation of works is culture’s natural habitat. We combat piracy for profit, but we are completely opposed to criminalising consumers. We still need some constraints and blocks in the digital world because we have not yet discovered another way of providing authors with suitable remuneration; but those days are numbered.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Europe has a rich and diverse cultural heritage and one which enriches our lives, not just aesthetically but economically. The sector contributes 2.6% of the EU’s GDP, as has been said. It shows higher growth than the economy in general and over five million people are employed in it.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are three very clear reasons why the Commission should keep its hands well away, unless we want to see culture go the same way as fishing and agriculture. However, the trading deficit in motion pictures alone between the EU and the United States grows year on year as European audiences choose American, rather than European, products. That deficit, according to the latest figures, was GBP 7.2 billion in one year alone.</p>
      <p sl="de">Free from the restraint placed on them by reliance on state funding, the six major US motion picture companies turned over USD 42.6 billion in 2006, whilst, according to a report by the European Audiovisual Observatory, the overall situation of the European film industry is deteriorating. That is because subsidies and legislation do not inspire artists – they breed bureaucrats and parasites.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The possibilities for culture have changed radically with the emergence and spread of the Internet. In my opinion, these developments have been almost exclusively positive. Culture has been vitalised, democratised and disseminated widely. Despite this, much of the European debate currently focuses on problems which the Internet is claimed to create for those engaging in cultural activities. That is unfortunate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">That is not to say that there are no challenges to culture. Copyright infringements and illegal file sharing are examples of such challenges. Large parts of this report also focus on these problems. Many proposals are currently circulating in Europe on how we are to deal with these issues. Unfortunately, in many cases little attention is devoted to our fundamental freedoms and rights as citizens. For example, perhaps the most controversial of these proposals right now seeks to ban those who have committed copyright infringement from accessing the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I should like to take this opportunity of urging my colleagues to support the amendment which I have tabled to this report. Briefly, my proposal emphasises the positive role which the Internet has played in culture and democracy, but it also rejects the idea of banning individual citizens from access to the Internet. Copyright infringements and file sharing must be combated by sanctions which are proportionate and which respect fundamental rights and freedoms. Forbidding individuals to access the Internet is in my opinion a gross violation of freedom of expression and information and is anything but proportionate. The Internet is more than just a copying machine or a channel for the illegal dissemination of films or music. It is an arena for free speech, information and communication.</p>
      <p sl="sv">For my younger brother, the Internet is as natural as watching television or chatting in the school playground at break time. And are we going to impose similar restrictions when a copyright is infringed in other ways? It was not so long ago that I was at university and there, unfortunately, many students illegally copied their course literature, but to punish them by forbidding them to read books or write articles would clearly be unreasonable. Someone who has shoplifted food is not forbidden to buy milk and someone who has stolen a bicycle is not forbidden to use the street. So let us not do anything so silly as regards other offences just because they have been committed on the Internet. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bono, on this report on cultural industries, which covers a wide range of questions that he has sought to answer.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to comment briefly on one aspect that I consider to be a priority: in the information, communication and digital technology society new forms of production and distribution are constantly emerging that mean new opportunities for producers, creators, artists and consumers. In this new context it is essential to find new, balanced formulas that combine respect for the rights of creators with citizens’ access to these cultural assets.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, cultural industries and creators, including SMEs, due to their dual cultural and economic roles, contribute both to promoting cultural diversity and to creating new jobs and possibilities for economic development and, given that they are part of one of the most dynamic sectors our economy, aid for the creative sector should be seen as an investment. Therefore, promoting lifelong learning that fosters creative talent and the phenomenon of synergies between businesses in the sector and schools should be a priority in European policies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, may I offer my congratulations on this important report on culture. The statement that, if he had to start all over again, he would start with culture, is attributed to Jean Monet. The written history of Europe goes back two and a half thousand years, and how rich and various is its content. Culture is a significant component of the development of our civilisation. Action favouring the industry that is linked to culture should be supported. It would be a good thing if funds could be found for the development of a network of modern libraries in Poland, with thought for people who cannot afford to buy books. There are still districts in Warsaw where there are no proper academic reading rooms. There is no working inter-library exchange system. Young people have to go into the city centre to access scientific works. The library system in the United States might serve as a model. Funds are needed for the development of local libraries that would provide access to the necessary materials, thus enabling people to educate themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I do not fully agree with Recital T of the report. National identity and language are at the root of creativity. Modern European culture only began when Dante and Petrarch began writing in Italian. The reason for the development of European civilisation has always been the spread of human individuality, its spiritual progress and the fact that peoples have made use of this to enrich the content of their own collective life.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, culture is a particularly strong and economic factor for us all, and we have seen that it generates multi-billion amounts in Europe, that millions of employees have a part in it and that many small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, are active in this field and are becoming very creatively and passionately active in the population.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important to me that these cultural driving forces have optimum access to the new digital and audiovisual formats. It is important to be able to introduce oneself to the relevant audience, and to devise new products in lifelong learning, in particular, as it is precisely these new and innovative means that are developing and promoting creative talents appropriately.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would very much like to thank Mr Bono for this report, which highlights the important role of the creative and cultural industries and, particularly, the increasing part they play in our economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As most of you know, I represent London, which is, of course, one of the creative hubs of Europe. Because of that, I am very aware indeed of the benefits that creative industries can bring to a locality. London is diverse in culture and thriving in its creativity and, as the cultural industries represent a significant sector of London’s economy, I very much welcome the recommendations to support their sustainability and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, having said that, there is one matter of great concern, which has already been alluded to in discussions on another report this evening. That is that, while there are a huge number of employees within the industry who are women, there are not very many women in higher positions in the creative industries, and I very much hope that we will be able to address this in future deliberations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the draft resolution draws attention to the link between a flourishing cultural industry and the cross-frontier mobility of artists; it urges the Commission to issue a Green Paper on the internal market for creators of products and services, which will provide an opportunity to compare achievements in this sphere. The report emphasises the role of culture in Community politics, and also the role of cultural education in the development of personality and a sense of identity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Creativity, and involvement in the creation of added value, are what determine the important economic role of the cultural industry. Its actual contribution to economic development, especially in the music and publishing sector, is many times in excess of expenditure on the development of culture.

They are an important source of job creation in creative areas that contribute significantly to a more competitive European Union. The calls to support cultural and creative industries through better qualification, education and training systems, in particular by seeking to provide students at all levels of education in cultural and artistic disciplines with professional training, reflect this situation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I support the calls to the Member States to include entrepreneurship studies in national secondary and higher education programmes, particularly in the fields of humanities, arts and culture. Further progress is also needed in the area of the mutual recognition of diplomas in art studies.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I appreciate this report, but I would like to make some remarks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The topic of the cultural industries is closely connected to the topic of the economic value of culture. Culture is now referred to in terms of means towards economic growth, and many studies now emphasise the economic impact of cultural activities. In this context, I recall the study The Economy of Culture in Europe made in 2006 by a private consultant, KEA European Affairs, that presents some impressive numbers for the cultural sector; however, these numbers are debatable since MP3 players, mobile phones and publicity are also considered by this study as ‘culture’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we feel that focusing on such economic aspects may lead to confusion, and important things such as creativity or artistic potential may be put in second place if they do not turn out to be sufficiently profitable.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am in favour of a cultural policy that supports cultural diversity, artistic creativity and the development of the artistic potential of individuals and communities: these are all guidelines that I think we should keep in mind for future action.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I have listened to the debate with interest. Of course, the report itself is very interesting and as the Chairwoman of the Committee, Mrs Batzeli, said, in many ways it also represents a stimulus for the Commission, for the Member States and for the world of culture and creative industries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think that the main theme or main goal is to get an overall picture, to make these stimuli a centre of attention and to create an environment that is favourable to creativity, innovation, culture itself and the status of culture in our society and our relations.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Allow me to say just a few words. We cannot exist without the economy but it is culture that lends meaning to our relations and our identities, and that defines the values that unite us in the Community. That is my answer to those who worry about everything being seen nowadays in economic terms and expressed in monetary values. Culture is about more than money but it is important to see it as a creative asset, as something that creates jobs and helps to develop the economy. The absence of culture in most cases results in the deterioration not only of the economy but also of politics and society. The absence of culture therefore has many consequences.</p>
      <p sl="sk">That is why I am pleased to see broad support for creativity and innovation in the proposals concerning the European Commission’s proposal for 2009. The formal proposal itself is already in this Parliament and I hope that the legislative procedure will soon lead to its adoption and to preparations for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In conclusion, I would just like to say a few words about fighting piracy. I believe, like many of you here today, that we must achieve a balance between accessing culture and its accessibility, communication and cultural opportunities on the one hand, and protecting intellectual property rights on the other hand. We must combat the abuse of intellectual property rights since this is often the reason why smaller and weaker enterprises collapse. That is the position of the European Commission. One way of dealing with this problem is through education: raising awareness of the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and not abusing freedoms. The other method is to invite and organise all stakeholders or those who have responsibilities in this area, to get them to cooperate and contribute to the efforts to protect intellectual property rights while developing access to electronic networks in modern communications. This is, after all, what we proposed for the first time in our recent proposal to reform the electronic communications networks and services (Telecoms Package) and it is also the European Commission’s attitude to the fight against piracy. Of course, a lot has to be done by the Member States themselves.</p>
      <p sl="sk">That is all I wanted to say, thank you. I look forward to further cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I think we should not forget what we are trying to achieve. Despite what some subjective studies would have us believe, it is not the 13% of Europeans downloading cultural content illegally who are threatening our culture, but it seems to me that it is the concentration of our culture in the hands of a few large groups that is damaging our diversity and therefore the richness of our cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will only give you one example, that of records. Today, 95% of what is distributed comes from the four big record companies. I believe it is important to ensure that consumers have genuine choice and it is necessary to guarantee pluralism of content in a very concentrated market where those chiefly responsible for innovation and creativity are small, not big. You were talking about SMEs, Commissioner, recommending a study which I think is a really interesting idea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The permission for a merger between Sony and BMG granted by the Commission totally contradicts the European policy to support SMEs in the music industry, which create more jobs than the large companies and represent 99% of the market players and 80% of innovation in this sector. It seems, therefore, that there is an urgent need to support diversity in the cultural sector, which is a genuine driver of growth and a means of development for individuals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I will say that it is the diversity of culture that makes it rich and not the other way around.</p>

      <p sl="en">Culture and creativity play a central role in promoting European citizenship. Both these items, culture and creativity, must be taken into consideration in future policies of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">An analysis of the economy of culture in Europe was sponsored by the Commission and important data has emerged. It transpires that culture taken in a general sense makes a substantial contribution to the economy indeed much more than originally estimated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Five years ago it was assessed that the cultural sectors contributed 2.6% of the EU GDP. In 2004 3.1% of the EU active population was working in this sector. The relationship between cultural activities and the economy in Malta and Gozo can be assessed by a recent 2007 study made by the National Statistics Office involving a total of 5086 participants enrolled in 34 dance schools.</p>
      <p sl="en">These dance schools employed 109 persons and generated a financial surplus of nearly 400 000 Euro. Total income surpassed 1 million euros.</p>

      <p sl="en">My region, the West Midlands, is leading the way in developing creative industries, with more than one in ten now employed in the sector. The region is one of the most multicultural regions in the UK and is proving that its competitive advantage in cultural diversity is becoming a source of creativity and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the EU must make a stronger commitment to supporting cultural industries by stimulating job creation in this area to counter the relocation of the EU’s traditional industries to emerging economies.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is needed is joined-up action and greater financial assistance for business start-ups and SMEs in cultural industries through the Seventh Framework Programme, the Structural Funds and the EU Social Fund. This will further harness the skills and talent of Europe’s entrepreneurs and workers, to ensure that the necessary skills are available to further develop the sector. The EU must support creativity for more innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue, we should also recognise the importance of cultural industries in creating awareness and understanding of other cultures, and, therefore, their importance for social cohesion. Similarly, Europe has a great deal to gain economically from its cultural diversity.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I wish to thank the rapporteur for producing a report that deals so comprehensively with the multi-faceted nature of cultural industries and the main problem areas associated with them. When pondering the status of cultural industries in European society, there are two basic principles that need to be remembered.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Firstly, we need to understand how important culture is for people’s quality of life. Cultural products enhance wellbeing. The Community recognises that Europeans have basic rights to education, which include people’s right to culture. We are therefore talking about fundamental civil rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Secondly, we need to understand how important culture is for those who produce it. For many the work is not just a passion - it is a livelihood. Receiving appropriate payment for one’s work is a basic right. It is up to the legislators to ensure that such people can work in an environment which is not detrimental to their rights. There is no cultural output without its creators, and if they are not paid for the work they do, the result is a limit to cultural growth.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Legislation on cultural industries, such as the protection of intellectual property rights and neighbouring rights, therefore always has to strike the right balance between culture’s two social dimensions. It requires special sensitivity on the part of the legislator. It has to be recognised that cultural industries are a very special sector and therefore require a very special legal status.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The main challenge for cultural industries is obviously information technology. They clearly benefit from developments in technology and the information market, but at the same time they need protection when new systems are being used.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We also need the Commission to deliver prompt measures to clarify the relationship between intellectual property and culture and the economy. The main challenge is how we can guarantee fair and genuine remuneration for every right holder and each individual cultural industry for the work done, at the same time ensuring that consumers have choice and easy access to cultural products.</p>

      <p sl="en">As the production of material goods is increasingly mechanised and outsourced, more people in Europe engage their talents in producing cultural goods.</p>
      <p sl="en">The KEA study commissioned by the European Commission significantly underestimates the contribution of cultural industries to our economy and society. While only 3.1% of the EU’s active population may be directly generating monetary value in the cultural area, their impact is noticeable almost in every aspect of our lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Pop culture carries cultural and social messages. Musicians and actors were instrumental in releasing the green economy wave. Music and film are powerful promoters of better understanding between people and of European values. Cultural industries predominantly created the demand for new technologies, for digital platforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, it is vital that the European cultural industries remain viable. First of all, we must ensure that creative people are able to sustain themselves by their creativity. This means that we must enable the creators to distribute their work as widely as possible, without any fear of abuse from the middlemen or the consumers.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Vasco Graça Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world (2007/2211(INI)) (A6-0075/2008).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-279" speaker_id="4450" name="Vasco GRAÇA MOURA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Portugal" birth_date="03-01-1942" birth_place="Porto" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats" m_state="PT">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having proposed a general framework for cultural matters in the context of the Lisbon agenda, I decided to incorporate into my report the many proposals put forward by Members since they were in line with the general approach. Therefore, if the report contains some points that might seem redundant when set against other instruments already approved in the meantime and in force, they serve to emphasise the topics thought to be the most relevant.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Recalling the main points of that framework, I would say that the European Union has a very special duty to safeguard Europe’s cultural richness. The European cultural heritage, in all its dimensions, must, by every means, be preserved and disseminated both within and outside the Union, without denying the fact that it is wholly desirable to take as open an attitude as possible to every other culture, which has, moreover, always been the hallmark of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Our cultural heritage, encompassing its diverse forms of expression and the combination of its founding sources, such as, Graeco-Latin and Judaeo-Christian antiquity, has, over the course of history, placed Europe in the vanguard of all the continents. It has proved to be an unrivalled driver of innovation, development and progress, which has spread in every direction, and today still constitutes an essential reference point for humanism, spiritual enrichment and enlivenment, democracy, tolerance, and citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In an increasingly globalised world, the outstanding specific qualities contained within the nucleus of Europe’s cultural richness constitute genuine European added value and their identity-giving role is vital for Europe and the Union in that it helps them to understand the world, bring about cohesion, emphasise their uniqueness, and assert themselves in relation to other peoples.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The particular ways in which the influence of European cultural heritage has over the course of history found expression in other continents must lead to special measures emphasising those factors which serve to build civilisation, mutual understanding and a constructive approach uniting the peoples represented. We recommend the Council and the Commission should enhance the prestige of Europe’s classical heritage and the historic contributions of national cultures in all their dimensions down through the centuries, while also allowing for the needs of the culture sector in the future.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We therefore suggest that the year 2011 be considered ‘European Year of the Greek and Latin Classics’ in order to make the peoples of the Union and the rest of the world more aware of this essential aspect of cultural heritage now in danger of being forgotten. For the same reason we stress the need to develop the promotion of European languages in the world and their role in creative artistic activity in other continents, so as to facilitate both mutual knowledge and understanding and the cultural interaction generated and conveyed by those languages in their extra-European dimensions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, the existing Community programmes in the culture sector do not fully reflect the implications of Europeans’ common cultural heritage, which is why we need specific programmes in order to foster creativity and preserve the links, on a wider scale and at a deeper seated level, with the goods and values, both tangible and intangible, that constitute European cultural heritage and to enable those goods and values to interact according to the humanist conception of identities and differences and in present-day cultural works.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The programmes in the cultural sector will all do a great deal to foster cohesion, real convergence, economic growth, sustainable development, innovation, employment and competitiveness, but we should not forget that culture and cultural products have value in themselves (culture qua culture). We would remind the Council that the intended budgetary funding for the measures proposed in the Commission communication and those already in existence need to be reviewed immediately and as a matter of urgency. Finally, since there is no time to mention any more points, I welcome the Commission’s communication and its approval by the Council. We agree with the objectives set.</p>

    <intervention id="3-280" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Ján Figeľ" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Graça Moura for his commitment, the Committee itself and all relevant contributors to this report. I believe that it confirms that culture deserves a more central place in our discussions, and in our days and years of cooperation. I think it is confirmation that we have moved from an original agenda dominated by hard material – coal and steel – to intangibles like culture, education, creativity and citizenship. We cannot measure it in kilos or tonnes but it is about the future of our unity, of our communities at local, regional and national, as well as European, level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that is why we put forward the proposal. Since last year it has received a great deal of concrete attention and support in the public domain in the Member States as well as in the Council. I am happy to see it because this was the most important answer: we want to work more through culture, for culture and also for the world of cultures or culture in the world. I am happy to see your support for this agenda, which is also very important. It has always been very clear to me as Commissioner, and also to the Commission, that the Parliament seeks to do more in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we need to adopt a common approach. This is the way to implement this agenda. The three basic areas are important, and were also mentioned in the previous report: creative industries; cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue; and, equally important, the external dimension – external cooperation in culture and culture in the Union’s external policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with you that we should not give too much weight to the economic importance of culture, but we really need to get the right balance in our cultural policies. Your report rightly recognises the importance of giving culture a larger role in international relations. We consider that this is an opportunity to build a proactive and constructive agenda on cultural diversity in Community policies. I know I can count on your collaboration in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the issue of mobility, we support the need for transnational mobility of cultural players as a major tool for building a European cultural area. Look, for example, at Erasmus in education. After a decade – now two decades – we have a European higher education area, the most popular programme and a lot of modernisation and openness at our universities. I think this quest for mobility, knowledge, respect and acceptance should also be developed in the area of arts and culture. I believe we can achieve a great deal now by starting the pilot project on mobility that you in the Parliament proposed last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last, but not least, it is important, as I said, to adopt a common approach. I am happy that Member States endorsed open methods of coordination. In November last year two expert working groups with representatives of Member States were set up with the aim of enhancing mobility of artists and culture professionals, as well as maximising the potential of the cultural and creative industries. You will be duly informed of the results of the work within these groups. As you know, we set up the cultural forum and the first was organised under the Portuguese Presidency, for which I am grateful. We also suggest that the cultural and creative sector at large should set up a platform on the cultural and creative industries and one on the access to culture, along the lines of the existing platform on intercultural dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that there is a growing volume of potential contribution and I am happy to work with my colleagues in the Commission, as well as here with you in Parliament, to reinforce the mainstreaming of culture in many other EU policies. I am, of course, looking forward, not only to the debate, but especially to the implementation of this agenda.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Graça Moura on a good report that, in a coherent and specific manner, presents the priorities in the sphere of culture and defines the long-term aims. The report shows the importance of culture for the development of the European Union and for enhancing the potential for innovation and increased competitiveness. Culture is a sector that creates jobs and gives a genuine boost to economic growth. On behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of the regions of the European Union as an important forum for cultural cooperation. Culture and language stimulate the development of regions and are a magnet for investment, especially in poorly developed regions with meagre natural resources and few tourist and leisure attractions. This is why local and regional authorities have such an important part to play in generally supporting and nurturing culture in the areas under their control. There is just one item in the report about which I have reservations – and here I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, so that I do not have to repeat myself in a moment – and that is what we find under Recital K, which suggests that we demand that immigrants and tourists subordinate themselves to European tradition and heritage. This is not a good piece of phrasing. During the Committee’s work, the members of the ALDE Group voted against this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the Year of Intercultural Dialogue it is worth pointing out that the European Union should, in putting into practice the values of intercultural dialogue, be open to other cultures. It should promote and create common ground for cooperation by putting forward interesting programmes. It is therefore not a good thing that the potential for European third countries to take part in the exceptionally engaging and prestigious European Capital of Culture programme after 2010 has been scrapped.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I was supposed to be making a further speech in just a moment, so I would like to request another 10 seconds this time round, if I may, and then I shall not get up a second time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe that it is first and foremost those countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy that should have the possibility of taking part in this programme. I keenly support the demand made in the report for 2010 to be declared as the European Year of Fryderyk Chopin, given that it is the 200th anniversary of the birth of this composer of genius, who made an incontrovertible contribution to European and world culture.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura most sincerely on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for his excellent report. Thank you, too, to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture. It can count on Parliament’s support for culture as a horizontal task, for increasing artists’ mobility, for increasing regional cooperation and for strengthening international cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also note the absence of something on this agenda. This is a subject we discussed in detail a little while ago. The cultural industries and their growing significance also mean that the economic aspects are becoming considerably stronger than has been the case in the past. The agenda for culture is not only about issues of better cooperation on the cultural agenda or of increased funding, but also of the legal framework. In that regard, it is indeed true even within the European Union that, if culture is in competition with internal market law or competition law, it always draws the short straw in case of doubt.</p>
      <p sl="de">You will all remember the Lévai report: the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services described collective management societies for online music as obstacles to competition on the internal market. Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law. Hence the urgent need, and tomorrow Parliament will decide the same way as the Committee on Culture and Education. The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries, but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner, therefore, is that we have just one time slot, and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law.</p>

      <p sl="et">Colleagues, our colleague Vasco Graça Moura has carried out some excellent work in compiling a report which refers both to cultural heritage and future needs, to common principles and specific initiatives. As shadow rapporteur, I express my thanks.</p>
      <p sl="et">I would like to focus on just a couple of points. As of the beginning of 2009 our circumstances will have changed: the Lisbon Treaty will have entered into force. In order for our diplomatic representatives to be able to represent our cultures properly, the cultural dimension should be consistently incorporated into our external policy. Currently we are a long way from achieving that. Initially we are talking of incorporating a cultural dimension only into development activities although this in itself poses difficulties for us. There are many very valuable elements in European culture, but instead of enjoying the aggregate of those elements we seem to achieve only an arithmetical average. European culture has, unfortunately, only a small presence worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="et">I venture to believe that the world’s finest film-makers and writers live in Europe, yet the world’s cinemas are dominated by Hollywood and the bookshops are full of entertainment in paperback form from America. Why do we translate mass foreign products, and why do we not translate each other’s best authors? Why do third countries aided by us prefer to spend money on American cultural products? This situation is in need of change.</p>
      <p sl="et">We must without doubt place greater focus on re-establishing a common European cultural space. A cultural space which includes the countries of the Mediterranean and Central Europe as well as the Nordic, Baltic and East European countries. We will be stronger as a result, and will achieve an aggregate incorporating all the valuable elements, an aggregate which is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, this is a very valuable and thoroughly prepared document. I congratulate Mr Graça Moura.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The draft resolution draws attention to the need for a specific approach to the problems of culture at a time of globalisation. Regardless of our openness to the heritage of other cultures, it is exceptionally important to protect, disseminate and promote European culture. It is important to remember the roots of our culture, and especially the role of the Greek and Latin classics; however, we should also look at those areas of culture that cross borders without hindrance and without the need for translation. I have in mind music and painting.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In 2010 it will be 200 years since the birth of Fryderyk Chopin – a composer of genius who is known throughout the world. Emphasising the significance of this event will make it easier to perceive the part played by all the outstanding European musicians – Mozart, Liszt, Handel, Haydn, Schumann, Verdi, Grieg, Berlioz, Paganini and many others – in the creation of European civilisation and in its contribution to world culture.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report also draws attention to current problems faced by artists in such matters as crossing frontiers, as well as the impact of their mobility on artistic development, and emphasises the role of art in economic development.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the interesting thing in this paper on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world is that it really asserts the strategic claim not only to organise cultural policy as a sector, but that culture should be an integral part of various European policy fields, such as foreign policy, urban development policy and Structural Funds policy. This really is a new quality. It changes the European Union’s self-image regarding the importance of culture and its strategic importance to policy as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">Culture is always a double-edged sword, and this is what is particularly interesting. It is always a product, but it is more than a product because it carries meaning and purpose. This evening I should like once again to put it in graphic terms: I am anticipating that this dual nature of culture will really have an effect in all policy fields, particularly regarding internal-market logic. Besides, Commissioner Figeľ will be very strong if he is successful in imparting the strategic importance of culture to the other Commissioners.</p>

      <p sl="cs">A globalised world implies global culture. This, however, is a term that can be interpreted in many ways. Across the European Union a global culture can be the essence of the best that individual European cultures represent. It can also be a post-modern universal culture that gradually overrides and forces out original European diversity. Personally, I favour the former scenario. I want the European Union to promote cultural diversity that enriches nations and lets them learn from each other. A globalised world globalises our lifestyles and ways of working. Multinational companies have turned our cities into a common marketplace so that sometimes we do not know whether we are in Paris or in Prague. As far as I am concerned, we have now had quite enough.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Culture has a place in the soul of a nation and roots in its place of origin. Culture can be communicated and is capable of both absorbing and eliminating. It is also vulnerable, however, if it becomes a mere commodity or makes concessions to popular tastes in order to be ‘accessible to all’. Culture should indeed be accessible to all but it should promote high values instead of pandering, set higher targets instead of reflecting our low demands, because the general public does not need a great deal to satisfy it. I would like to thank the rapporteur for emphasising in his report the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of all European nations.</p>

      <p sl="hu">As an ethnic Hungarian from Romania, I would like to draw Member States’ attention to supporting Europe’s minority and endangered cultures. Examples of these include the ancient cultures of the ethnic Hungarians living in Romania, the Moldavian Csangos, the Szekler people of Transylvania, as well as those of the Macedonians in Greece and Bulgaria, the ethnic Serbs in Romania and the Basque people in Spain. The recommendation adopted by the Council of Europe on the basis of a report on the Csango people by the Finnish MP Tytti Isohookana-Asunmaa is a concept that could be emulated, as its objective is to preserve the Csango culture, which is on the point of extinction.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the context of the European Union’s foreign relations, we must also pay heed to Tibet, under occupation by the Chinese Communist dictatorship and where, as the Dalai Lama has put it, cultural genocide has been unleashed on one of the world’s most ancient cultures. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, first I would like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura for the quality of his report, which in every point reflects his knowledge and high level of expertise on the subject.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report reaffirms culture’s place in the construction of Europe and the need to protect it and to promote diversity. He underlines the essential role it plays in meeting the Lisbon targets and in the EU’s external relations. He quite rightly calls for the strengthening of actions in areas such as literary translation, the promotion of European languages, the teaching of art and the cultural industries, but also in the protection and promotion of our heritage. In this regard, we need to promote existing cultural programmes and support new initiatives such as the creation of a European heritage label, which will help to develop a common identity while encouraging cultural tourism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report also highlights the opportunities offered by digital technologies in terms of access to and the promotion and spread of culture, while emphasising the need to protect intellectual property rights. In this context, it is right to support the setting up of specific projects such as the European digital library, the purpose of which is to digitalise our heritage and access to it, and preserve it for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, thank you to the rapporteur and also to the Commission for this document. Once again the central role of culture in European integration and in the worldwide image of the European Union is being highlighted. How we choose to deal with this recognition, which is not new but is extremely important, and integrate it into every area of policy – as is already specified in Article 151 – has been well defined in the present agenda for culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is pleasing that, during the preparatory work, a wide consultation process took place with various cultural stakeholders who do essential cultural work, for which we must thank them. We urgently need this cultural strategy in order, for example, not only to be continually referring to our cultural diversity with pride, but also to be able to cope with the challenge of dealing with this diversity and the problems that arise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Implementation of the strategy will be crucial, however. President Barroso announced a task force for culture back in November 2005 in Budapest, which could be an important signal to the outside world, but has not so far been implemented. I hope this will not be the case with this agenda for culture. Promoting culture is a return on investment in the areas of intercultural dialogue, of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and of internal relations, and it is also above all a social value added.</p>
      <p sl="de">We use art and culture. It offers us great benefit in almost every social and economic field. It should not be exploited, taken advantage of or starved out, however, and we should also therefore be thinking of an appropriate budget.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I congratulate the Rapporteur, my colleague Vasco Graça Moura, for the way in which he knew how to manage the rather large number of amendments to this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Personally, I was glad when the Committee on Culture and Education of the Parliament approved, with a large majority of votes, my amendment regarding the study of the European Union history in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union construction should be studied so that young people would know the stages of the European Union’s establishment and development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that, in order to know the culture of a country, each of us should know the history of the given country.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Creating a parallel with the European Union, in order to know and understand European culture in a globalized world, we should learn the history of European construction, especially since, as of 2009, the new Treaty of the European Union will become effective, we will all be European citizens and each citizen has the obligation to know his/her history.</p>
      <p sl="ro">My initiative aims at preventing future situations in which young people learn parallel histories, which have no ground in reality. Since the European Parliament has just celebrated half a century of existence, I believe it deserves to have a history that promotes cultural identity and European culture in the context of globalization.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome this report because it shows that this Europe is growing together and that culture plays a very special role in this. If we think of the Capitals of Culture alone – next year it will be the city of Linz in Upper Austria – these give many creative artists the opportunity to get to know another new part of Europe. Later on there will also be a lot of visitors travelling from Linz to the other Capitals of Culture.</p>
      <p sl="de">This programme contributes a great deal to mutual understanding. In the case of Vilnius, in particular, we have a very good opportunity to show how strong cooperation can actually be. This should also be an example for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the point I want to make concerns equal access to culture no matter what your background; rich or poor, culture has to be accessible to all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Free entry to museums and art galleries – certainly in Scotland and the United Kingdom – has seen record levels of people visiting cultural institutions. That is why free access to cultural institutions and cultural events is so important across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of the points in this report – paragraphs 10, 25, 26, and 46 about 2011 being the ‘European Year of the Greek and Latin Classics’ – are very interesting. The decline in the teaching of classics in state schools in my country of Scotland is deeply depressing. How can we understand the present without understanding the past? I am grateful for the report.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Union has a duty to safeguard Europe’s cultural wealth because our cultural heritage must be preserved, disseminated and shared both within and outside the Union. If this plan is to be implemented, it must receive political and financial support. The Community’s existing cultural programmes do not fully reflect the scope of our common European cultural heritage. I support the calls to the Commission to propose specific programmes to promote both artistic creativity and the tangible and intangible goods and values that constitute European cultural heritage. This cultural heritage should be managed in a sustainable manner. The support of public/private partnerships is vital to achieve this goal. The proposal to establish a European arts sponsorship scheme may be a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="ro">It is more than suitable to discuss, in the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a true European agenda for culture, which is to be promoted both inside the European Union and internationally.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Therefore, I welcome the drafting of this report, which correctly emphasizes the importance of this field and the need to mobilize its potential fully. Culture is the basis of promoting the values of peace, democracy and tolerance, as well as a highly-performant economic growth that could deal with the challenges of globalization in the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="ro">From the report’s multitude of recommendations, I would like to reiterate two aspects. First of all, at an internal level, it is essential for the local and regional actors to get involved in promoting culture, as factors of economic development and Lisbon Strategy implementation, as well as of consolidating cultural heritage and promoting cohesion in contemporary society. Second, it is in the European Union’s best interests to promote culture and intercultural dialogue at an adequate level in its foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this field, the countries included into the Neighbourhood Policy should be the main beneficiaries of these actions.</p>

    <intervention id="3-295" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Ján Figeľ" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="sk">Thank you for the debate and in particular for the positive, constructive atmosphere. This is a testimony to the belief in the importance of culture and the current agenda. I want to assure you (although I am one of the new arrivals from the enlargement) that never before in the Union has culture been as prominent and as central as it is today. Of course, this is not only about the formal agenda: it is about a process, progress and implementation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In recent years several things were achieved for the first time in history: the European Commission’s role as a representative of the Community as well as common representation of Europe’s 25 or 27 Member States in UNESCO are the results of a certain cultural maturity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A few months ago the Member States agreed to introduce an open method of coordination although many people did not expect them to do so. We have a permanent forum for culture, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and there is a consensus on making 2009 the European Year of Creativity and Innovation: all this represents enormous progress.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the other hand, culture has of course a dual nature. It has an economic dimension but it is also a vehicle for conveying meaning and substance. That is why culture is specific and lacks exclusivity in European law. That is also why in individual cases or disputes we want European law to apply but at the same time we want the specific nature of culture to be taken into account: the need to maintain and strengthen the culture diversity that is our heritage, our distinguishing feature.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Before I finish, let me say that I agree that more investment is needed. The Commission proposed a budget of EUR 500 million for the Culture Programme but only EUR 400 million was approved. In the future it may be possible to support cultural aspects under other programmes as well. When we were summing up the contributions of the Structural Funds to individual structural operations in the 27 Member States, I was very pleased to find out that for the period 2007–2013 approximately EUR 5 billion have been allocated to culture as a whole, across the entire Union, from the Structural Funds. If we act responsibly, we can combine our individual potential, resources and policies. This, I assure you, is also my responsibility and I would like to invite you to cooperate and help to implement this agenda. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Vasco Graça Moura once again.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, after so many good contributions I am sorry to have to reply briefly just to some of the points that I consider essential, but I think they all, like the many points in the report not mentioned here, bring extraordinary enrichment to this debate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First I should like to stress the new policy to introduce culture in the terms set out in the Commission’s communication. That was mentioned by Mrs Trüpel and it is a question of ensuring that the cultural aspect is included in other European policies. I think that is fundamental. The second point was raised by Mrs Mikko, and concerns the cultural dimension that should be incorporated in Europe’s external policy, not merely European Union culture but the culture of the Member States – it is absolutely essential. Thirdly, as Mrs Hieronymi mentioned, there is a fine balance between economic aspects and the economic utility of culture and culture as a value in its own right (culture qua culture).</p>
      <p sl="pt">Just two more points, Mrs Staniszewska mentioned the importance of cultural action at regional and local level that is also emphasised in the report, but I think needs to be underscored. I am in complete agreement with that. Finally, I must also stress that giving families and students access to culture via schools and society, as well as building bridges between cultural heritage and the exact sciences, innovation and technology, are fundamental aspects of those concerns.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, since it is impossible to go into any further aspects, I should merely like to conclude by saying that culture is an inalienable and indispensable system of individual collective values and experiences and that it is with those collective and individual values and experiences in mind that Europe should approach the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">I wish to use this opportunity to outline some major issues presented in the Graça Moura report on the ‘European agenda for culture in a globalising world’. First, the social situation of artists: I agree with the fact that we should work out an appropriate legal framework in the areas of tax, labour and social security for artists and performers. We should also focus more on the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Culture Programme is good, but is not enough, and I support the idea that we should have other programmes alongside it, more focused on the preservation and promotion of European cultural heritage. Last but not least, I wish to emphasize the need for an effective partnership between the public and the private sector. In order to overcome the present challenges, culture should be partially funded by the private sector. Therefore, a European arts sponsorship scheme should be created as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the efforts of the Commission in proposing an agenda for culture enabling a European strategy to be pursued both within the European Union and in the EU’s relations with third countries. In this Year of Intercultural Dialogue, it is important to devote special attention to promoting diversity and intercultural dialogue, as culture is a key dimension of the Lisbon Strategy and we will not achieve the fundamental Lisbon goals unless we treat it as such.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I was disappointed to see that the report pays scant attention to relations among cultures, minorities, national or ethnic groups, or among the countries they live in. We cannot ignore the fact that the arts have a prominent role to play in the integration of minorities, but they can also provide social support for talented but impoverished artists. By supporting the arts and artists, we can provide prospects for poor ethnic groups that are transnational in character, such as the Roma people, who have preserved their centuries-old cultural tradition to the present day.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, we must ensure that regulations governing commercial (Internet) relations are open and transparent to ensure fair market access, thereby allowing European cultural industries to develop all their potential, particularly in the audiovisual and musical sectors. Alongside adequate consumer protection, we must eradicate the root causes of counterfeiting and piracy, and protect Europe’s cultural diversity by means of sound and fair regulation of competition based on achievement.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Philippe Morillon, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters (COM(2007)0330 - C6-0236/2007 - 2007/0114(CNS)) (A6-0072/2008).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-302" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joe Borg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report. Since the adoption of the Council Regulation on fisheries outside community waters in 1994, many conditions have changed and international obligations have increased for the authorisation of Community vessels outside Community waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal has, therefore, been put forward as part of the 2006-2008 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the common fisheries policy. The aims of the proposal reflect that spirit by integrating existing legislation into one regulation, while ensuring that the rules applying to Community vessels in third-country waters are applied equally to third-country vessels in Community waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many provisions are unchanged regarding the current system of issuing fishing authorisations. The major new points of the proposal can be summarised as follows. Firstly, all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are included in the scope of the proposal, those being fisheries partnership agreements, bilateral fisheries agreements, agreements in the context of regional fisheries management organisations and private agreements. This wide scope is essential, as all flag states under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are responsible for the vessels flying their flags. Consequently, vessels fishing under all kinds of agreements should be included.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, a mechanism to reallocate under-utilised fishing opportunities has been introduced in order to optimise the utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements. This point was raised during the discussions on most fisheries partnership agreements and is now integrated into each of them in order to increase the value for money under each agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a last point, I would like to mention the proposed provisional application of fisheries agreements, which will grant the Commission the necessary legal basis to transmit licence applications to third countries prior to the adoption of the Council Regulation concluding the agreement. This will, in most cases, ensure that Community vessels can continue their fishing activities in third-country waters without interruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the report, I would like to comment on the amendments proposed. The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 3, 5, 11 and 16. As for Amendments 7 to 9 concerning the eligibility criteria, this list has been transformed into a positive list, rather than a negative one, in the first Presidency compromise text. In general terms, the compromise text, however, covers the Committee’s concerns, except for the extension of the eligibility criteria regarding infringements in the past 12 months, which is Amendment 8. The Commission finds that this provision should remain unchanged, believing it important as a precautionary measure in case of possible serious infringements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 2 on the definition of infringements, as the definition of serious infringements is clear and is set out in Regulation No 1447/99. Regarding the amendment concerning non-transmission of all applications, which is Amendment 12, it should be noted that Article 10 has been deleted as part of the Presidency compromise text. This was done on the basis of the opinion of the Council’s legal service, which stated that the Commission has no legal basis to penalise the vessels of Member States as proposed in this article.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also finds that the Member States’ possibility of giving their opinion on any decision is already provided for in Article 9(2) and that any informal procedure prior to or after a negotiation should not be contained in this regulation. Therefore, Amendments 6 and 10 cannot be accepted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before closing, I would like to stress the following. Firstly, the daily transmission of catch data is required under the Regulation on electronic logbooks. Secondly, closing a fishery implicitly means that fishing authorisations are no longer valid for the stocks or areas concerned. Thirdly, all fishing activities in mixed fisheries must be considered as affecting the stocks concerned. Fourthly, national legislation determines what can be used as evidence in a court of law. This is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13, 14, 15 and 17. Amendment 4 and Amendments 18 and 19 cannot be accepted, since the text proposed by the Commission is correct – in the case of Amendment 4 – or is sufficiently clear – in the case of Amendments 18 and 19.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, I cannot accept Amendments 20 to 24, since the scope of the proposal is to cover all agreements and not just third-country agreements, as I said at the outset. In addition, the reallocation of unused fishing opportunities is necessary in order to ensure the best possible utilisation of the fishing possibilities under the agreement. Such reallocation is best dealt with in the context of the issuing and renewal of licences.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to stress that this proposal is part of a package containing the proposal on combating IIU fishing, as well as the revision of the Control Regulation to follow later this year. As referred to by the Committee on Fisheries, the Commission will, while keeping transparency and simplification in mind, aim to harmonise these proposals and avoid any overlap between them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, nothing surprises me, and in particular nothing surprised me in the Commissioner’s communication.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, thank you for that very detailed exposé. I would simply like to recall here that the declared objective of the Council’s proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the procedures for managing fishing authorisations. It was a question of introducing general provisions applicable to all authorisation applications, as you yourself said, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A single procedure for managing all fishing authorisations has been proposed. The sharing of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States is defined. New eligibility criteria, penalties in the event of infringements and provisions regarding reporting are also proposed. Compliance with the international regulations laid down by the different agreements is strengthened by the introduction of measures requiring Member States to exclude vessels from fishing if they are found to be involved in a serious infringement or if they have been placed on a list for taking part in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mrs Stihler had been designated for this report but because the majority of members of the Committee on Fisheries did not agree with her on two points she considered key, she preferred to remove her name from the report. It therefore falls to me to present this draft as Committee chairman. However, I would like, in passing, to thank her for her work and I will leave it to her, when she presents her amendments, to give us the reasons for her decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Within the framework of the consultation procedure, in her report which is now mine, the Committee on Fisheries has proposed a number of amendments to the Council’s proposal for a regulation, and you gave an exhaustive list of these – not a list but the numbers, Commissioner. These were adopted by a large majority of 19 votes for, 5 against and 2 abstentions. I will only present the main ones here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States. Secondly, an infringement should not be considered to be serious unless it has been confirmed by a successful prosecution in accordance with the relevant national legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, the IUU list should be understood to mean the list of fishing vessels identified in the framework of a RFMO or by the Commission under the Council Regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - that very important task, Commissioner, which you are personally rather keen on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly, the Commission shall not refuse to transmit applications to the authorising authority without having given the Member States the opportunity to submit their observations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fifthly, the Commission may not refuse to pass on applications unless it comes to the Commission’s knowledge, on the basis of duly substantiated facts, that a Member State has not complied with its obligations under a particular agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Sixthly and finally, Community fishing vessels for which a fishing authorisation has been issued shall transmit to their competent national authority the data concerning their catches and fishing effort with a frequency appropriate to the agreement and fishery concerned. The transmission requirements shall be compatible with those contained in the e-logbook regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will leave it to my colleagues to talk more about some of these amendments, because some of them are the authors.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, in general terms, apart from some aspects on which the Committee on Fisheries, in agreement with the Council, has corrected the Commission in order to avoid excess discretion, we support the fundamental aspects of this proposal, the objective of which is for there to be a single framework for the Community system of authorisations for vessels operating outside Community waters.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore going to vote against the amendments already rejected by the Committee on Fisheries that have been tabled again with 40 signatures, which go precisely in the opposite direction, in that they insist that agreements on exchanges of quotas should remain outside the general legislation on licences to fish.</p>
      <p sl="es">In my opinion, given that the Court of Auditors’ report on the shortcomings of the control policy is still making the headlines and it has been decided to tackle once and for all the fight against illegal fishing, it is not very acceptable to claim that some agreements should continue to be outside a general framework that is very necessary as a basic legal guarantee of equal and non-discriminatory treatment, both among operators and among Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">It should also be pointed out that we are immersed in working on an integrated and coordinated focus for the different Community policies, in particular maritime policy, a focus that Parliament has fully supported, as well as the even more necessary process of simplifying Community legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this respect, it should not be forgotten that we are talking about more than 9 000 vessels that operate under the different agreements and regional fisheries organisations, which means processing more than 16 000 fishing authorisations, as no agreement, in either the North or the South, is exempt from this obligation.</p>
      <p sl="es">If it is time for anything, then, it is time to harmonise and simplify a framework to make it as standardised as possible and not to continue creating differences that only make monitoring difficult and generate mistrust of the rules.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Morillon report on fishing authorisations – or I should say the ex-Stihler report. As the original rapporteur, I was compelled to remove my name from the report when the Committee on Fisheries rejected my key amendments. The report was supposed to simplify fishing authorisations. Instead, the Commission over-reached itself with an unnecessary article awarding itself the right to reallocate fishing quotas.</p>
      <p sl="en">If supported unamended, this report will unjustly discriminate against northern countries and their historic fishing rights and jeopardise relative stability. To give the Commission carte blanche to reallocate fishing opportunities beggars belief, especially when fishing opportunities are scarcer. We have to ask ourselves whether we are facing a fishing free-for-all in the North Sea. This is not in the interests of Scottish fishermen, nor is it in the interests of protecting and conserving stocks. The next review of the common fisheries policy is due by 2012 and this report is a wake-up call that historic fishing rights are under threat in the North and Baltic Seas. I have retabled key amendments for the plenary and urge colleagues to support them. If these amendments are defeated, I urge voting against this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Morillon on taking over this report on behalf of the committee, but I really have to commiserate with Ms Stihler, because she did a lot of work and then, as we heard, she had to withdraw her name from the report. That is always a great cause for frustration, after a rapporteur has put a great deal of hard work into the preparation of a complex bit of work like this. But I can well understand her reasons for doing so.</p>
      <p sl="en">While few in this Parliament would argue with any proposal that seeks to enhance fisheries compliance, it is of major concern to me that Article 13 of the report, which deals with under-utilisation of fisheries opportunities, will simply provide the Commission with the right to reallocate fishing opportunities from one Member State to another. This would clearly undermine the entire concept of relative stability and as such would destabilise one of the core principles of the common fisheries policy. In fact, Article 13 is something of a Trojan horse, as it seems to have more to do with gaining access to fishing opportunities previously allocated to other Member States than with reducing bureaucracy and red tape and improving compliance, which I thought the report was all about.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know that in the Fisheries Council the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark have all expressed similar concerns, so, as Ms Stihler said, this is a resurrection of the old North-South divide, which I thought had disappeared long ago, and that is something that we do not want to see coming back. I very much hope – contrary to what Commissioner Borg told us in his earlier remarks – that tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of Amendments 20, 21, 22 and 23, tabled by Ms Stihler and signed by 40 MEPs.</p>

      <p sl="es">Thank you, Madam President. Mr Stevenson, I am sure that we are going to vote against the amendments that you have just mentioned, and I do not have any doubt that this North-South situation is completely new to you. So far you have only experienced the situation in the North and we have experienced the situation in the South. We would now like to experience something of the situation in the North, because it seems to us that it works well for you in the North, and therefore those of us in the South would like to share some of it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission for agreeing to simplify the text of the proposal as it is true that the first version had some elements that were difficult to accept. The review of the control Regulation, the Agreement with Greenland and something that the Commissioner mentioned, the proposal for a Regulation on IUU fishing, all enable the scope of this proposal to be limited.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am sure that tomorrow my group will, as it did in committee, vote against those amendments that aim to avoid the adoption of a general mechanism for using surplus fishing opportunities, something that we have always advocated, just as we have always been in favour of the need to have a uniform system for using surplus fishing opportunities that applies to all agreements, not just to southern agreements, which was the Council’s commitment when it ratified the Partnership Agreement with Greenland. Consequently, I think that I can say that my group will vote against those amendments that are an attempt to make this system apply only to southern agreements and not to northern agreements. Therefore I think that we are going to apply it to all of them, so all of us will feel more comfortable.</p>
      <p sl="es">Regarding Article 12, we agree with there being an interim procedure for allocating licences before the Council adopts the decision ratifying the agreement, for and we think that a legal solution needs to be found this issue. We therefore agree with the Commission on the need to have a mechanism that ensures that fishing opportunities are not put at risk, as stated in Article 12, if the process of ratifying a fisheries agreement has not been completed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, according to the Commission, the aim of this proposal is to serve the objectives of the common fisheries policy and to allow the Community to better ensure compliance with its international obligations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Community fishing fleet is active in the territorial waters of around 20 countries under the scope of bilateral agreements. But as we seek to manage our fisheries sustainably by limiting fishing in the European Community waters, we should be careful not to export the problem of over-fishing by handing out authorisations for vessels to freely exploit waters of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I pointed out to Commissioner Borg only last month, we must pay particular attention to our international moral obligations to Africa. Unsustainable exploitation of marine resources in Africa’s oceans on a massive scale is causing the collapse of fisheries, the loss of critical ecosystems and the extinction of marine wild life. A large part of the problem is unreported illegal and unregulated fishing by the EU and other fishing companies. In 2005 alone an estimated 40% of fish were caught without licence or in violation of regulations in the waters of Guinea-Bissau.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all on the issue of the inclusion of overseas countries and territories, I wish to clarify that the regulation does not apply to them, since the scope of the proposal does not cover vessels flagged with overseas countries and territories. However, it does apply to the outermost regions, which are considered Community waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with those who have supported this proposal as it stands, with its wide scope in order to make all agreements more effective and to ensure more value for money, in line with the overall objectives set by the Committee on Fisheries itself and others, like the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the amendments, let me again say that some of the amendments are accepted, as I indicated. Others have been overtaken by virtue of the first Presidency compromise text or because the proposed amendments are already provided for elsewhere in the regulation or in some other legal provisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to repeat that all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are to be included in the scope of the proposal. This is essential, because the states party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as I said before, are responsible for the vessels flying their flags.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities is there to optimise utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements. This is, after all, only proper management of fisheries agreements and it will not undermine relative stability, given that Article 13(6) of the proposal states the following: ‘Transmission of applications in accordance with this article shall not in any way affect the future allocation of fishing opportunities amongst Member States.’ So it will be a reallocation to maximise the fishing opportunities granted or available under fishing agreements and not a means whereby a precedent would be set which would undermine relative stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would also like to say that this provision is becoming a regular feature of fisheries partnership agreements with third countries and it has also been included, with the agreement of the Council, in the Greenland agreement.</p>

That is the purpose of amendments 20 to 24 tabled by our colleagues. The second concern is the one expressed by Mrs Stihler, namely that with this revision of the regulation, there could be unreasonable exploitation of fish stocks, in particular the fish stocks of third countries. Some of my fellow Members here have echoed this and that is why they signed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, my thanks are due to the shadow rapporteurs and all on the Fisheries Committee for producing a well-balanced report on what is a very complex and in many ways sensitive issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">In some public debate, rights-based management is equated with the employment of individual transferable quotas. The report takes a much broader view, treating the term as covering any of the forms that can be taken by the right to harvest fish, given that these are seen as a common public good. So understood, it is clear that there is a variety of such forms currently in operation throughout the EU. For example, the extent of the right may be specified by reference to the territory to be fished, the amount of fish to be harvested, the effort allowed or some mixture of these. Similarly, although the right is implicitly transferable, there are various limitations in this respect. For example, that from Community to Member States is conditioned by the principle of relative stability. Further, there seems to be a considerable range of such limitations. One particular form of divergence between Member States is how far transfer for economic value is permitted, either formally or informally, and thus amounts to a tradable right.</p>
      <p sl="en">The central issue is, then, how fisheries management should engage in constituting the right to harvest in order best to obtain the objectives of the common fisheries policy. The Commission communication raises the question of the extent to which a single system might be introduced, either at Community level or by harmonising the practice of Member States. The report of the Fisheries Committee details a number of concerns about the adverse impacts that certain types of rights-based management might have, but also touches on the manner in which some of these might be prevented. It indicates too the way in which certain types of rights-based management can have positive effects, provided they are properly devised.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report notes the variety of systems of rights-based management currently in place, the degree to which the forms of right concerned are hybrid ones and the complexity of the issues involved. It is consequently rightly cautious about the idea of moving to any single system. Over and above the need to protect artisanal fleets, we raise the question of whether, on a more general basis, the same system would be appropriate for both single species and multi-species fisheries. We finish by asking the Commission to address a number of different questions in its study and, in view of all that needs to be taken into consideration, to allow a longer time for debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to touch more deeply on one aspect of the report. Although rights-based management is essentially a juristic concept, I have the impression that much of the drive towards its discussion has come from economists.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think that anyone here would doubt that fisheries management must take account of sound economic principles. Indeed the report indicates some of the positive outcomes to which economic efficiency may give rise.</p>
      <p sl="en">But such efficiency has to be seen as an instrumental good. As the report states, it is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP. I have personal doubts that economic efficiency is sufficient, in itself, to promote all these objectives to the desired extent and suspect that there are ways in which it may prove counterproductive to some aspects of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I seek reassurance, therefore, that the Commission will take a genuinely rounded approach, both in relation to the content and to the outcome of the study.</p>

    <intervention id="3-317" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joe Borg" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur, Ms Attwooll, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report, the contents of which I can almost fully endorse.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries. This is a crucial issue in the present context, where poor economic performance is the rule rather than the exception. The quest for a higher degree of economic efficiency generally has very positive effects on overcapacity and hence on sustainability of fisheries activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report, however, also accurately identifies the possible negative effects. In my opinion, such effects could be contained, if not eliminated, by introducing provisions intended to limit concentration of rights, to deal with allocation issues and, as proposed by the report, to protect artisanal fleets. These are being dealt with by various means in third countries where rights-based management systems in general, and individual transferable quotas in particular, have been in place for quite some time. As stated in the report, such systems are a complex matter, but difficulties associated with them are not insurmountable.</p>
      <p sl="en">On balance, I think the possible benefits are larger than the possible negative effects. However, I would like to confirm once more that the Commission has no intention of proposing Community management systems. Nor is it the Commission’s intention to promote a given and universal rights-based management system. Different fisheries will require different systems. I am also fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue in relation to relative stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue working on this issue. In the short term, we are aiming at increasing the general knowledge on rights-based management and identifying best practices to be shared with Member States’ national or regional governments with fisheries competences. We will also consider issuing guidelines or similar supporting documents to that effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results of the consultation process – including, of course, the report of the European Parliament – and the outcome of the ongoing study on rights-based management systems in the Member States and experiences in third countries will be important inputs for this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the medium term, rights-based management is going to be one of the topics in our reflection towards the next reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will keep you informed about these future developments and I look forward to further fruitful discussions with you on this important issue.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, more than 10 years ago, Parliament considered the possibility of introducing fishing rights into the CFP, through an own-initiative report on the future review of the CFP.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can therefore only express our satisfaction at the Commission’s decision to finally examine the possibilities of this fisheries management tool, although in my opinion, in a too simplistic and superficial way, undoubtedly due to a fear of unleashing the fury of the Council regarding these matters.</p>
      <p sl="es">Those who are the most resistant to change and the least enterprising, both in the fisheries sector and in the Council, have always feared any change to management systems, even for the better. This does not mean that these sectors and Member States are in a better situation, or even in the same situation as they were 30 years ago, but rather they are dragging the more dynamic sectors towards a dead end.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that management through the allocation of fishing rights raises questions with regard to implementation, but it is just as true that countries in which fishing is an important sector for the future have been able to resolve them, demonstrating that, at least for parts of the fleet that are able to evolve towards more modern, efficient and sustainable approaches, it has advantages that are far from negligible.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore also welcome Mrs Attwooll’s report, which, alongside the concerns, has succeeded in reflecting the possible advantages, which could include improvements in control, a reduction in capacity, a decrease in discards and lower dependency on public aid.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity, and one that needs to be profitable, which is now ceasing to be the case, therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present, to analyse these issues in more detail.</p>
      <p sl="es">Having said this, I wish the Commission great success in this debate and I hope that the management model, which has been a failure, can be changed in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I should like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll for her hard work to achieve the maximum possible consensus on her report. This is a complex and controversial issue but it is extremely important for all who are concerned about the sustainability of resources, and this includes the sustainability of the most precious resource for all who make up Europe’s innumerable fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore think that the report strikes exactly the right balance between the different points of view. The results of the vote in the Committee on Fisheries – 21 in favour out of 24 – bears out what I have just said. It is important not to avoid this debate but equally important not to decide too hastily. As a Member elected for a Member State where the small-scale and multi-species fisheries which predominate in the south of Europe are very important, I am concerned about the introduction of management systems involving trade in fishing rights, which might bring benefits for shipowners with greater purchasing power to the detriment of smaller shipowners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I also fear that the general adoption of such a system might be counter-productive, possibly even leading to higher catches to offset the cost of acquiring the fishing right. I therefore repeat that I support the overall conclusions of the report, to the effect that no decisions should be adopted until we have studies covering all Member States and the different types of fisheries plus a wide-ranging debate to assess all the variables involved in this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I should like to begin by paying tribute to the commitment of the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, in drawing up a balanced report on a question as fundamental as the sovereignty of Member States in the management of their fisheries resources and the setting up of private property rights for access to and exploitation of that public good.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, although we appreciate paragraph 11, the report contains many points on which we totally disagree, for example, viewing this debate as an anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy or including points that more or less explicitly argue for adopting fishing right management mechanisms at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In our view, each Member State should be responsible for managing its marine resources, in particular as a way of safeguarding its food sovereignty. We therefore reject any step-by-step process that could, in future, lead to the setting up of a rights-based management system in Community fisheries, that is the marketing of fishing licences, days at sea or quotas, which would inevitably lead to the appropriation and concentration in private hands of a public good.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is a complex area and I certainly commend Ms Attwooll for her report and her efforts in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Representing a region whose overall experience of the common fisheries policy has been far from positive, I must say that my natural inclination is strongly against the imposition of any EU-based management system. Rather, I am quite clear that Member States should be able to decide what management system works best for them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, maintaining stability, I fear, could be severely jeopardised in the industry if unregulated transferable quotas were embraced, with particular threat to single and small-scale operators. It would be better by far in my book to repatriate real powers over fishing to Member States and concentrate on getting in place viable local management systems capable of enjoying the confidence of those affected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also fear that this new study will prove to be another protracted excuse for putting off real and helpful change. I hope that does not prove to be so, but we have seen that in the past.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, and to say that, in my opinion, the natural marine heritage should be preserved and should be used in a sustainable manner by the fishing communities whose lives are traditionally bound up with that environment; it cannot be regarded as just another business. I therefore do not share the vision of marine ecosystems and the associated fishing communities as a market, where fishing rights may be freely traded, perhaps even on a kind of stock market, which would naturally lead to the industrialisation of fishing and pose a threat to the equilibrium of the ecosystems and fishing communities. Even more, it seems to me that we simply must not allow anything to jeopardise the principle of relative stability and I therefore think that the Commission should be as cautious as possible in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Attwooll for her work and welcome this report as it has initiated a much-needed debate on alternative management measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly agree with the report when it points out that the current fisheries management systems within the EU, specifically in the area of TACs and quotas, do not provide an answer to our problems, and that it is necessary to hold a wide-ranging debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission states that: ‘Alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management.’ However, I would venture to suggest that alternative management measures should and must play a compulsory role in the future, as we need to take on board a range of factors, including climate change and up-to-date marine and fisheries research based on sound science.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I pointed out in my now redundant opinion of the Committee on Fisheries for the report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, I have no doubt that climate change will impact on EU fisheries regulations, as allocations of quotas based on historic catch patterns will need to be revised as a result of the shifting distribution of fish stocks. Furthermore, fisheries management will have to be increasingly based on adaptive approaches as historical data will be less valuable.</p>
      <p sl="en">As climate change and other factors increasingly impact on our fish stocks, our management will need the necessary flexibility, based on sound peer-reviewed science, to adapt to the new conditions and ensure sustainability of resources.</p>

      <p sl="en">I agree with what the rapporteur said, namely that fisheries cannot be looked at purely in economic terms. I need to stress here that the subject is far from simple. I certainly agree that such systems are a complex matter. As I said before, we have to take into account in our reflections possible limitations on the concentration of rights, the resolution of allocation issues and measures for the protection of artisanal fisheries, and we have to approach this matter gradually.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the short term, we need to learn more, we need to identify best practices and we need to study where rights-based managements systems have operated successfully in certain Member States and look at experiences in third countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I cannot say that I am altogether reassured by the Commissioner’s response, because it seemed to me that, in what he was saying, he was actually giving pre-eminence to one particular form of rights-based management, whereas what the report is seeking is a review of all different types of forms to assess their merits and demerits.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we are all agreed that the common fisheries policy is in need of reform. A newspaper in my constituency that picked up the European Parliament press release on the report cites me as being cautious about the reform of the CFP. This is certainly not so if it is taken to mean that I have any doubts about the need for reform. I am cautious, as I think we all are, to the extent of wanting to be reassured that the reform is in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the course of writing the report, for example, it occurred to me to ask just how compatible with one another the different ways of defining the extent of the right to fish are. My feeling was that, whilst quota and effort limitations both combine readily with territorial restrictions, neither of the first two sits that comfortably with the other. This in turn made me realise that, technical though a report on rights-based management might, on the face of it, seem, the issue it raises goes to the very heart of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst generally applauding the direction of current reform, I hope that the discussion may trigger a more radical reappraisal of the tools we use, so as to achieve the best possible balance between improving the livelihood of those engaged in fisheries, having a sustainable marine ecology in which fish stocks are conserved and maintaining the viability of fisheries-dependent communities. I would not like to think that, in advance of a thorough study, some prior decision had been taken as to what might achieve the very best balance.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, today, with the adoption and discussion of the guidelines, and tomorrow, with the vote on the Guidelines for 2009, we are taking the first step in a budget procedure that departs from the pattern of previous years in at least two ways.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The first departure is that we are testing a new cooperation formula between Parliament’s administration and the Committee on Budgets; we are treating this as a pilot project, but this should comply with the generally binding principles for the budget procedure following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Secondly, 2009 brings new challenges, which no-one is questioning. One such challenge is certainly the likely entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and with it a fundamental enhancement of powers of the European Parliament’s codecision, the paving of the way for Parliament’s activities as a genuine legislative body. Secondly, this is an election year, so there will be costs linked to the election campaign and certain costs – besides the obvious savings – linked to the end of the current parliamentary term. Thirdly, the Statute for Members will come into effect, which will increase the personal cost burden, the burden of our costs in the European Parliament budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In many of these matters we already have certain quantifications, certain calculations since, in parallel with the principles, we are getting to know the forecasts, the first budget preliminaries for 2009. In the most important area, however – in other words, in the area associated with the increase in the powers of the European Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon – we have got as far as a working group, which will establish the extra costs that may be associated with this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Recognising the specific challenges that await us in 2009, we cannot at the same time exempt ourselves from the duty of frugal management of European taxpayers’ money, i.e. from certain self-imposed restrictions which we shall also expect from other European institutions. Proliferation of the administration in an election year is certainly not the message that the European electorate wants to hear – the electorate to whom we are turning for a renewal of the European Parliament’s mandate. A further essential aspect of the guidelines is internal obligations, to look for opportunities for what is referred to as the redeployment of existing human resources, not to increase staff numbers, and to concentrate on those functions that will mark out the future of the European Parliament, which we define using the term ‘correctivity’, and which are associated with legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today we must also discuss, and we should discuss, an issue that has a certain media resonance and that clearly also has extra-budgetary dimensions. What we need are three new regulations in parallel. The first is the introduction of a Statute for Members, with a distinct budgetary dimension; the second is new pension fund principles; and the third is employment rules for assistants, which must be transparent enough not to arouse temptations, and not to arouse suspicions surrounding the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As rapporteur I propose that this material be referred specifically to our Parliament’s resolution of 25 October 2007 and to the unanimous decisions of the Praesidium and the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. I know that at present our curiosity is being stirred more by the calculations than by the guidelines, and so I am counting on this document being smoothly voted through tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The budgetary orientations of our institution for the year 2009 represent the document based on which the budget of the European Parliament will be established this autumn.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, beyond the amounts and programmes, this year’s budgetary orientations bring to discussion an issue I consider very important: the legal situation of the European Parliament assistants. I would like to thank Mr Lewandowski for having approached this subject as well.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe the time has come for the old system to become clearer and more transparent and to provide these young people with social and fiscal rights equal to the rights of the other members of the institution’s staff. For the latter, there are the Staff Regulations of the European Communities, a very comprehensive document, which provides the staff working in the European Union institutions with adequate social protection.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Most of the parliamentary assistants are also foreign citizens in relation to the country where they carry out their activity and, consequently, they should enjoy the protection provided to all workers in international organizations. I don’t think it is normal to have cases in which the Belgian state imposes additional tax liabilities on assistants, taking into account that they pay all due taxes and contributions to social insurances in their country of nationality.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Still, the Parliament needs clear regulations for assistants as regards situations such as disease or maternity as well. In several resolutions, the European Parliament has already requested the Secretary General and the working group on the Members’ Statute and Assistants and Pension Fund to draw up a new set of rules that would solve the problems the assistants are currently dealing with.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe it is our responsibility toward the European citizens to have only clear and transparent rules in this institution.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the European Parliament’s budget for 2009 will be a very special one, as this Parliament will have codecision in almost all areas for the first time if the new Treaty enters into force in 2009. The Treaty of Lisbon achieves what our predecessors were already calling for more than 50 years ago without obtaining it: not just advisory powers, not just assent procedures, but codecision and democratic control by this Parliament over nearly all of Brussels’s policy areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The inclination to call for more staff is therefore great. Codecision means a more difficult procedure in each committee, but it does not mean double the workload. This budget therefore remains cautious, and that is good. Where additional staff are needed, redeployment is attempted. Few new staff will be employed – indeed, that would be hard to justify with almost 6 000 employees.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The work of this Parliament must indeed be made more visible. Web-TV is to be launched after the summer and, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I hope that the editorial team enjoys a position of independence, with full freedom to show the debates held here. We owe our voters that openness. What we also owe our voters is full verifiability of our expenditure, and good management of human resources.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Assistants must have a proper contract, with the social security and pension provision usual in each European institution. At least 1 in 10 members of staff are working here without any social protection. This has to change. A statute for employees must be brought in, preferably by the end of this year, and it is incredible that there are attempts to oppose this, to oppose the social spirit, the spirit of solidarity, of the European Union, from the ranks of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Further work will have to be done on long-term strategies, regarding for example the purchase of buildings and technological innovation. The Statute for Members also has an impact on the budget. Subsidies to the Sakharov Foundation in Moscow must be no more than one-off cases, nor is it the primary role of this House to finance museums of European history; such expenditure must be borne by the European budget. Further debate is needed on this.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Lewandowski, for a good report, and also by expressing my satisfaction with the new procedure and the more open dialogue and early briefing of the committee that has been evident. As several in this House have remarked, 2009 is a special year. Even though the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been ratified in all countries, we have to take account, in our budgeting, of its entry into force in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="da">The European Parliament’s new powers – giving it, for example, influence over the agricultural budget and over legal policy – will mean adjusting some of its priorities to cope with the new responsibilities. Then there are the elections to the European Parliament and the Statute for Members, which also have an impact on the budget.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is content with Parliament’s draft budget remaining within 20% of EU administrative expenditure. There is no guarantee that this will be feasible in the next few years, but it is important that we hold administrative expenditure in check.</p>
      <p sl="da">I should also like to express the ALDE Group’s great satisfaction with the emergence of a new model for the remuneration of Members’ assistants. Our group has wanted to see a statute for Members’ assistants for a long time. It is the right solution for Parliament to take over the administration, and this is reflected in the 2009 budget.</p>
      <p sl="da">Considerable savings have been achieved from the sale of buildings over the last 10 years, but I agree that we have now reached a point at which this policy must be revised, and that the buildings policy in general should undergo a service. We have yet to see a proposal for the other institutions, but there is cause to keep a watchful eye on the growing buildings expenditure of those, too.</p>
      <p sl="da">Finally, the issue of the financing of the future EU Minister of Foreign Affairs and the President of the European Council remains important, but we shall come back to that later.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the guidelines for the 2009 budget procedure presented by the rapporteur, Mr Lewandowski, relate principally to the European Parliament, and have the potential to apply to other sections.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In view of the financial restrictions that have been adopted and the immensity of the new tasks linked to the Treaty of Lisbon, the elections to Parliament, the change in the Statute for Members and the proposed introduction of a statute for assistants, 2009 will be a very difficult year. There are a lot of unknowns, so the most important matter will be implementation of the guidelines. Detailed analyses of needs and the associated cost analyses will enable us to keep within the financial framework and at the same time should ensure that Parliament functions smoothly and that the new tasks can be handled. Our political group will be voting in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, 2009 is the year of new things, and therefore of uncertainties and dangers. It will require all the talent of our rapporteur, the former chairman of the Committee on Budgets, to meet this challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A new Treaty that is going to double the scope of Parliament’s codecision. Imagine the effort that will be needed for this, particularly in budgetary terms. A new Statute for Members. Totally unknown at present: which countries are going to allow their future elected representatives to fall into this new system, and which elected representatives are going to want to do so? An election campaign, a new code of practice, particularly for assistants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have been asking the Bureau for this for nearly ten years and I am delighted to see that this dossier is finally ready. It is quite simple though, since we are all aware of the package that will not cost taxpayers a penny: putting assistants on a Community footing, for those working in Brussels, and those who pay them directly under Parliament’s control, for those working in the constituencies. There should be a constant budget for this because honesty does not cost a penny, just a little political effort.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am also passionately in favour of new working methods, particularly on buildings issues, because like many of my fellow Members, I am always surprised after a call for tenders at how astonishingly high construction costs are when it comes to building work by the European institutions. If we really want to make savings, perhaps it is not necessary to translate everything I have just said into Maltese, Latvian and Hungarian, because in eight months’ time it will not be read by anybody and that would save EUR 17 million per year.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Mr Lewandowski’s report presents a calm view of the size of Parliament’s budget. The Social Democrats and Greens have quite unnecessarily proposed amendments which would mean a less controlled way of spending money.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The view taken in the report on the ‘House of European History’ is along the right lines when the rapporteur states that it is not for Parliament to finance such a project, even though it is the idea of the current President.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report also adopts a position on the Commission’s budget. The comment is made that its administrative expenditure does not extend to some 2 000 employees, who are outsourced for employment in its agencies. This expenditure is excluded from the total sum, from which 20% is deducted for Parliament’s use. Parliament cannot outsource its operations in the same way, and it also has to finance support for the pan-European political parties out of its own budget.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I agree with the view of the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets that when preparing the European Parliament’s budget for 2009 the priority is to take into account Parliament’s more extensive duties after ratification of the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In particular, there is the European Parliament’s new role of sharing law-making equally with the Council of the European Union. Although the transition from the consultation procedure to the codecision procedure will not necessarily mean doubling the workload of the parliamentary committees, we have to remember that the increase in codecision powers will be unprecedented, and that Parliament will assume responsibilities for producing legislative acts. The European Parliament’s political priorities must therefore be properly funded. Of course we have to try to save money wherever possible but only under the condition that the budget continues to be adequate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in Mr Lewandowski’s very comprehensive report, I was particularly interested in the Parliament budget for this election year, which has consequences for the institution’s communications policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Improving communication to European citizens was one of Parliament’s priorities for 2009. For them to feel more involved in the forthcoming elections and to get the highest possible turnout, it is important for MEPs to be closely associated with a decentralised information campaign in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also hope that local media will be fully integrated into this campaign because they play a key role in passing on information. Parliament’s communication budget and the actions planned for 2009 should therefore make sure that they interest and directly affect European citizens, who often feel that the European institutions are too detached.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Note that generally speaking these actions follow on from those begun and funded in 2008. We also hope that the new visitor centre and the web TV will soon be operational to provide better information on Parliament’s activities and to improve the relationship between citizens and the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in preparing the European Parliament’s budget for 2009, the issue of the total budget expenditure ceiling and whether it should not exceed 20% of total EU administrative expenditure has once again come to the fore. I would, however, like to endorse the approach taken by the rapporteur, namely that the European Parliament’s level of expenditure should be based on requirements that are justified following careful evaluation. Certainly, 2009 will bring significant changes to the European Parliament’s work. With the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the volume of legislative work will increase considerably, and the change in the system of remuneration for MEPs will give rise to additional costs, as will the publicity campaign in connection with the European Parliament elections.</p>
      <p sl="lv">By focusing on the main spheres of activity, however, and carefully analysing the budget requests, as well as evaluating the possibilities for re-allocating officials internally before creating new permanent posts, it is possible to keep the level of expenditure in the European Parliament’s budget within the 20% limit. All opportunities to reduce inappropriate paper and energy consumption at the European Parliament have not yet been exhausted. I am pleased with the support given last year to the proposal to reduce the circulation of paper versions of individual documents, stipulating that paper versions of these documents be accessible on request, instead of automatically being distributed to all Members and officials. Implementation of this proposal is making it possible to save over three million sheets of paper a year. This principle can be applied to many more types of document. Regarding the European Parliament’s budget for next year, the issue of expenditure on Members’ assistants cannot be overlooked, and I therefore call upon the working group set up by the European Parliament’s Bureau to come forward with proposals to make the payment of these costs more transparent and more easy to monitor. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, there are three issues in this debate to which I would like to draw attention.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, the level of inflation in individual EU countries is rising sharply, and as a result the average level of inflation across the EU will be around 4% in 2008, so indexing expenditure at 2% annually actually means a fall in expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, one consequence of adopting the Treaty of Lisbon will be a marked increase in the powers of the European Parliament, the codecision procedure in all areas, and also the powers of the Member States’ parliaments, which will cause a sharp increase in the European Parliament’s functioning costs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly and finally, 2009 is a year of European Parliament elections. So far the turnout for these elections has been exceptionally low, particularly in the new Member States. Additional expenditure is therefore needed for an information campaign aimed chiefly at regional and local media, through which the electorate can be most effectively reached.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity to canvass support for the amendment by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the secretarial allowance. I know that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have tabled another amendment; ours has the same wording as the decisions of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, which all group chairs voted unanimously to support. I do not actually think it fair what is now being said about the Committee on Budgets living up to its reputation of doing its own thing again. The amendment by the Verts/ALE Group talks of a statute for Members’ assistants. This will be the result if the Bureau’s amendment, that is, the result of the negotiations with the Council, become available.</p>
      <p sl="de">We, too, are striving for this statute for Members’ assistants, but we do not yet know whether we shall obtain it, whether we can even come to an agreement with the Council. I should therefore like to request that this phrase not result in the rejection of all the Bureau’s wording. I think it is very important that we proceed in this House with as much agreement as possible and do not needlessly quarrel over details we do not have the power to establish. Hence my heartfelt plea to endorse our amendment. Not a single word has been added or left out.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The problem that arose most often in this debate, apart from the specific challenges of 2009 and the need to manage European taxpayers’ money frugally, was definitely the problem of Members’ assistants. I want to avoid the manner in which this problem is resolved becoming a battlefield for rival political groups, as all groups in our Parliament are united by an awareness of the need to resolve this problem in a way that removes the temptation to engage in corruption and the suspicions that surround this matter, while at the same time taking into account the heterogeneity of the 27 countries that make up the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to reassure my fellow Member Mr Kuźmiuk that expenditure is set to rise by 4.8%, so probably by more than the level of European inflation. Meanwhile, may I wish Mrs Gräßle success in completing her reports before midnight.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I should first like to acknowledge the excellent work of my Polish colleague Mr Lewandowski on the 2009 budget guidelines of the ‘other institutions’, namely the European Parliament but also the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This document runs through the main challenges that will be on Parliament’s agenda for 2009, particularly the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. Everything must be done to ensure that Parliament’s enhanced responsibilities following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon are taken into account in the budget. However, I wonder whether, prior to the budget procedures, an audit should be carried out of the human resources allocated to the European Parliament’s activities. The European Parliament’s political leaders are becoming increasingly important and it is essential that MEPs have the means to work in complete independence.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to speak here even at this late hour, and thank you all for your understanding.</p>
      <p sl="de">I requested permission to speak here. I am speaking for the Commissioner’s sole benefit, as I think it is important to tell the Commission that we consider the amendments we have tabled, on which we shall also be voting tomorrow with a very large majority, to be important. I wish to tell him that we are only at the consultation stage with this dossier, and I should like to assure him on behalf of the whole Parliament that our amendments will help to bring greater order into the agency system. It is therefore very important to us all across the group divide that the Commission take them on board. I am obliged to the Commissioner for his assurances in this regard, and I shall also be monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is very important to me that he also understand why we want this. We need better accountability in the agencies and greater transparency, particularly among staff members. This concerns our budgetary law most directly. The Commissioner will also be aware, of course, that if our wishes are not taken on board we shall find our own ways to fulfil them. We regard this essential to our budgetary law.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission had originally intended the present reform of the Financial Regulation to consist of merely technical modifications. We talk of better regulation, yet I have noted with great sorrow that the latest joint decision on agencies by the Council and Parliament in July has not been incorporated. The Commission’s draft came somewhat earlier, but it would have been nice, of course, if it had been subsequently reworked. I should have also thought this fairer than leaving the work to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament has introduced political changes with great unanimity right across the group divide. We want to bring internal operations, responsibilities, transfers of appropriations and accountability of agencies more into line with the operations and practice of the Commission Directorate-General by means of a declaration of assurance. We also want a better overview of the personnel and financial costs of the agencies. We want to be informed of all employees and not just those on the establishment plan. This is an absolute necessity.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to give an example from a recent report by a decentralised agency on financial management in 2007. Thirty-nine posts are listed on this establishment plan, whereas 43 temporary staff and 11 contract staff appear in the text two pages before this. No two figures match, therefore. It is left to the reader’s imagination as to whether we now have 39 plus 11 posts or 43 plus 11 plus 39, or whether the 39 posts of 43 staff are listed and the 11 are then added. We just do not know. I shall clarify the issue, but clarifying this issue for the large number of agencies is no fun, of course, and reporting and the reporting system are more or less equally chaotic in all the agencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">The agency I have just quoted, ENISA, is interchangeable with any other, and I should indeed like to ask why the information we are given is so full of inconsistencies. We also want more information on the agencies’ revenue – which, thinking of Alicante, can indeed be sizeable – and we want to know what is happening to this revenue. I thank the Commissioner in advance for taking on board these amendments – as he has just announced his intention to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">Currently, we have 29 decentralised agencies with 3 914 employees on the establishment plan for 2007, with a budget of EUR 1.1 billion, EUR 559 million of which comes from the EU. The five executive agencies have 176 posts. The latest Commission communication on agencies was a very interesting one. The offer of a joint working group is very important. All three institutions must undertake to think through with each other the issue of the agencies’ future and area of work.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Germany, the issue of agencies and the growth of agencies is in the public eye. The media resonance is always great. The reputation of the European Union is also at stake if we do not succeed in conveying to the outside world why we actually need these agencies and what role they play in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should also be pleased if the Commission could prove why programme management is more efficient and better value when done by the executive agencies than by the Directorates-General. This is a request that those of us concerned with the budget have already put forward on a number of occasions, but has still not been backed up thus far in writing by the relevant facts and figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament’s amendments serve to maintain an overview of the European agencies, and our urgent request to the Commission is to help us to bring more order into the agency landscape. As the Commissioner should know, we in Parliament trust the Commission on this issue. We know that this institution is our last resort, as it were, when it comes to creating order and transparency and providing a better overview in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to thank my fellow Members from the other groups, and particularly Mrs Haug, the rapporteur on agencies from the Committee on Budgets, and the two rapporteurs Mr Mulder and Mrs Herczog from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their suggestions, all of which we have taken on board. I therefore believe that we have put forward the proposed and desired amendments by Parliament that are most pressing at the present time. I beg the Commissioner also to incorporate these amendments in the corresponding draft.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Grässle, for her important work within the framework of these reports, which enhance the plans for a financial regulation for executive agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when the European Parliament is set to see its prerogatives strongly reinforced within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon, I think it is particularly important to remember what our institution’s competences are, obviously as co-decider of the budget. This Parliament, elected by direct universal suffrage by the citizens of the EU, must be able to do more and better to control the proper use of Community funds spent, this time by the executive agencies. I would like very briefly to highlight four points in this report, which seem essential to me if Parliament is to be able to play its role fully and make it as easy as possible for citizens to understand our institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I would also like to emphasise the need for better control over the use of assigned revenue. It seems important for the director of the agency to tell us about any transfers between titles exceeding the 10% threshold.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly I should also highlight the importance of the figures for the establishment plan, as our fellow Member has just mentioned, whether for temporary staff, contract workers, seconded national experts, etc., so that we as the budgetary authority have a clear picture of the development of the human resources budgets of the agencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, I think it is quite natural that we should be asking for a summary of the development of the agencies’ budgets to be sent to the European Parliament each year, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Fourthly and finally, the provisions in the report concerning the harmonisation of the deadlines for the discharge procedure should also give Parliament real control of the proper execution of the budget.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I would like to take my turn at complimenting Mrs Grässle on the excellent work she has done, and obviously the Commission for this development concerning the agencies. I would like to highlight the very important provisions on the internal auditing of our agencies and suggest, following on from the comment by my fellow Member a moment ago, that we could work towards a consolidation, a sort of sub-consolidation in the EU’s accounts for all agencies, so that third parties and particularly MEPs, have a picture of the development of the accounting mass represented by all the agencies of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in taking the floor in the debate devoted to amendment of the financial regulation for executive agencies and their offices, I would like to draw attention to two matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, there should be support for the rapporteur’s proposal that directors of agencies be obliged to notify the European Parliament if they have transferred funds from operational to administrative in an amount that exceeds 10% of the ceiling.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, in view of the fact that executive agencies’ functioning costs are covered by the budgets for individual programmes, the almost ten percent level of these costs has an impact. The failure to specify these costs in the case of the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency in particular has an impact when linked to the information that there is a shortfall of more than EUR 40bn for the projects that this agency deals with.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gräßle on two very good reports.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all summarise briefly the amendment to the Regulation on the financial regulation of executive agencies assigned various tasks in connection with the management of Community programmes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This amendment, in line with Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, was the joint work of the associated committee and the Committee on Budgets. I especially thank my fellow Members and Mrs Grässle and Mr Mulder for their close and excellent cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We proposed several amendments aimed at enabling these agencies to operate fluidly, enhancing accountability and expanding opportunities for closer democratic monitoring of the funds assigned to these bodies.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is important to note that:</p>
      <p sl="hu">as regards the discharge procedure for these agencies, standardisation of deadlines is urgently needed in future;</p>
      <p sl="hu">the Court of Auditors has also pointed out that individuals involved in auditing and control work should not take part in budget implementation measures;</p>
      <p sl="hu">taking due account of the protection of personal data, a list with the names of persons who have cooperated with the agency and the remuneration received by these experts should be attached to the relevant agency’s report on budgetary and financial management;</p>
      <p sl="hu">monitoring of the use of external experts by the agencies must be enabled.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Thank you for your kind attention.</p>
