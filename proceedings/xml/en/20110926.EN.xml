      <p sl="unknown">I would like to make the following announcements.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 22 September an event of great importance for the EU took place. During the 66th General Assembly of the UN, the permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, made a speech on behalf of the whole European Union. This is really a very important event for us.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">The next matter: On 21 September Troy Davis was executed. This punishment was inhuman and unacceptable. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to express our firm opposition to the death penalty.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">On many occasions we have expressed our opposition to the death penalty without taking into consideration whether it was carried out in a democratic country, or in a country like Iran, where on the same day a 17 year-old boy, Alireza Molla-Soltani, was publicly hanged. The execution of a minor is a violation of international law. The European Union has always been against the death penalty, without exception. This type of retaliation is not an act of justice.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Finally, announcements relating to the current part-session. We have a very important plenary before us. This week, we will be voting on the six-pack. This is a great achievement. We have significantly improved on the first draft of these legislative measures. This is proof that the Community method is playing an important role in tackling the crisis. However, negotiating the package took a long time, almost a year. The financial crisis which is being addressed by the six-pack has deepened during this period. I think we should look at creating a fast-track procedure which could shorten the current procedure. When we have to deal with extraordinary circumstances we should have the right tools as legislators to be able to act quickly. Of course this does not refer to all draft legislation, just to some of it. I intend to hold talks on this matter with the representatives of the political groups and the representatives of the parliamentary committees, especially those with the largest number of legislative acts. Let us see if we can draw up a procedure of some sort. This is only a proposal on my part.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Could you also remember that Mr Barroso will be giving the State of the Union address on Wednesday? We are also expecting a presentation of the Commission’s annual Work Programme soon. The latter speech will be important. We are expecting legislative acts to emerge next year – and emerge they must – to help us tackle the crisis. They will require rapid adoption if we want to strengthen our economy, stabilise our financial markets and send EU public opinion a signal that we are able to act quickly and effectively in accordance with the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I also wanted to remind you that tomorrow, for the very first time, we will have Question Time with the President of the Euro Group, Jean-Claude Juncker. We have so far had Question Time with Mr Barroso and Ms Ashton, so this is an extension of the way we represent voters in a situation of general crisis. Ms Ashton will also take part in tomorrow’s debate on the Eastern Partnership Summit planned for 29 September in Warsaw.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a particular request that as many of you attend these debates as possible. These are, indeed, key debates and we very much want, firstly, to have a serious discussion on matters which concern our citizens, and we also want to show our citizens that we are interested and take an active part in debates. This is a very important request. I think you already know this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to start by thanking everyone for the collaboration and the excellent cooperation that we have seen during the drafting of this report. I should like to do so in particular because the report was drafted during the summer break, which is always a particularly difficult period but everyone made themselves available to participate in carrying out the various obligations, which has made it possible for us to be here today, debating the content of the report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would additionally like to thank the rapporteurs of the opinions of the various committees that were involved for the contributions they made, which have been included in the final report. Finally, before moving on to the actual content of the report, I must express my utmost gratitude and thanks to Susanne Kiefer and Oren Gai, staff of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, who worked with me during the month of August; I truly believe that they deserve very special thanks and recognition.</p>
      <p sl="pt">And so to the matter at hand; the Commission has judiciously launched the Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation Funding for the 2014-2020 period. We have already had various opportunities to discuss this matter with the Commissioner, and it is my honest opinion that this represents the perfect opportunity to reinforce the strengths and benefits of research and innovation at a European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Additionally, however, as I have said on many occasions, my understanding is that a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation Funding cannot be completed from the sum of its parts, as we know that the whole is often not equal to the sum of its parts. Therefore, when we put together the Framework Programme, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and add in the associated funds, we do not have a common strategy unless we also think about the objectives that should be associated with this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why, right from the beginning, I sought to define what the main objectives were in the proposal. I believe that the available resources will primarily serve a threefold purpose.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first is to reinforce capacities: European researchers are our most valuable resource with regard to research. Reinforcing these capacities, together with infrastructures, is one of the areas of investment that we must urgently address.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Secondly, the second objective is research potential and cooperation. This is without doubt one of the areas in which we have been most successful; we must reinforce this, and we must not let fundamental areas that are crucial for European wealth, such as social sciences and basic research, slide. Without these, we lose innovation, without these we remain uninformed about the societies in which we must politically intervene; it is for these reasons that we must not let them slide.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thirdly, innovation and the market must serve the common good. I believe that it is only by defining our objectives that we can truly create a common framework that serves all and that has the potential to convert research and innovation into central and determining factors in such pivotal times as the one we currently find ourselves in: a time of economic, social and financial crisis that is leading us to an increasingly disparate Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I decided to keep the Structural Funds separate from the European Funds, as it is essential that we pave the way to cohesion; it is therefore important to guarantee decent working conditions for European researchers and to ensure that the simplification measures for research are implemented. I speak as a researcher with ten years experience. Researchers cannot be the guinea pigs of the very bureaucratic systems that we create; those measures must be implemented. This also underlines the importance of considering not just excellence, but also the path to excellence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In a divergent Europe, competition cannot be a race that is always won by those who have access to the first places at the winning post, and we know who they are, Commissioner. Therefore, it is important to guarantee that competition, as seen in the field of research and innovation, remains healthy to ensure the best conditions for all; this must be done with a view to cohesion and convergence, to ensure that the whole of Europe is an area of excellence in this respect.</p>

    <intervention id="1-025-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Máire Geoghegan-Quinn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to address all of you before the final vote tomorrow morning on the Green Paper own-initiative report ‘Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation Funding’, now known as the Horizon 2020 Programme. I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Matias, for this excellent and enriching report and for delivering it in good time, allowing the Commission to consider your proposals in depth in the context of drafting the Horizon 2020 package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank the ITRE shadow rapporteurs, as well as the members of the six committees that delivered their opinions to ITRE. The Parliament has been showing an immense interest in the operation of the future EU research and innovation programme, which is very significant as the Horizon 2020 proposals will be transmitted to you for your consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">Horizon 2020 will come into effect for the next financial framework commencing in 2014. Within the Commission’s proposal for this new budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework adopted on 29 June, we set out a total budget of EUR 80 billion for Horizon 2020 at constant 2011 prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a budget designed to stimulate growth and jobs. The overall financial envelope is ambitious but realistic. Prioritising investment in these areas now is the recipe to ensuring growth and jobs in the future. With this proposal the Commission is clearly showing its strong commitment to delivering on the ambitions of Europe 2020 and innovation union.</p>
      <p sl="en">The aim of Horizon 2020 is to make EU research and innovation funding more efficient, easier to access for participants and have a greater impact. The overwhelming response to the consultation launched by the Green Paper earlier this year has given us a very practical input as to how this can be achieved. More than 1 300 responses to the online questionnaire were received and stakeholders also submitted some 750 consolidated position papers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Ms Matias, as well as the other MEPs who participated actively in the event on 10 June 2011 to wrap up the Green Paper consultation process. This was an excellent way to show all stakeholders that the EU institutions are working together to achieve the same policy goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that the main issues addressed in your report are in line with those raised during the consultation process. We are clearly in broad agreement concerning the main issues that should be considered in our future funding programme. I would like to highlight some of your suggestions for Horizon 2020 that are particularly interesting to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am of course very satisfied with the strong support you show for the concept of the common strategic framework and its objective of bringing research and innovation closer together and providing support across the full innovation cycle, from lab to market. Excellence will remain the main criterion for allocating research and innovation funding. At the same time it is necessary to build stairways of excellence for those Member States and regions that are under-represented in the current framework programme. This will mainly be a task for the structural funds. I am determined that our researchers should spend more time at their work and less time on administration. Simplification will be a major element of the Horizon 2020 package.</p>
      <p sl="en">One issue where we strongly agree is the need for a measure of continuity as regards the main successful instruments in the current programmes. This concerns, in particular, collaborative research, the European Research Council and the Marie Curie Actions. I am also pleased that we both support an approach that places EU funding close to societal challenges and therefore close to the EU’s ambitious policy objectives in areas such as climate change, health, energy and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to highlight that the Matias report takes on board several ideas already foreseen in the Carvalho report on simplification, the Merkies report on Innovation Union, and the Audy report on the FP7 Interim Evaluation. From the Commission’s point of view, a line of continuity and coherence has been maintained and this has been of great help to us as we prepare the legislative proposals for Horizon 2020.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, it is easy to agree with the conclusions of this report, and the Committee on Budgets has a very positive view of the final result that we are to vote on tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to highlight in particular the Common Strategic Framework that the Commissioner just mentioned. What are also worth noting from a financing perspective are the possibilities for the future offered by the European Investment Bank and what have been termed ‘innovative solutions’, which the Committee on Budgets also see as a positive option.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Then again, at the same time it may be good to remember that there is a difference between loans and grants, and the debate on soft loans should be conducted wisely so that the boundary between these two categories does not become blurred.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As regards the Europe 2020 strategy, we know that we are likely to find barely enough research funds in the next multiannual financial framework and therefore it is important for the Cohesion Funds to also be involved in this work.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Last but not least, we must also avoid the sorts of problems that we are experiencing right now with the financing of ITER or we will end up in the same situation that we are facing in respect of the 2012 budget.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report identifies many important elements that warrant due consideration: coordination between research and innovation programmes and the cohesion funds by strengthening the role of regional and local governments, as well as simplifying procedures and providing the necessary flexibility to update policy priorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Allocating a share of the budget to small and medium-sized enterprises concerns young people and businesswomen above all, creating a link with the standard creation system. In particular I would like to highlight one element I personally proposed, the voucher for innovation. This consists of assessing, within the common strategic framework, a trial based on the principle of accreditation – of vouchers – in order to encourage companies to focus on technological development and innovation, creating a system where the various stakeholders, enterprises, universities and research centres can take an active role in the creation of innovative processes.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development also wanted to emphasise the potential importance of research for the entire agri-food system. This is not simply research leading to innovation in the laboratory, but research that can produce concrete results in the field.</p>
      <p sl="it">We felt it necessary to emphasise that research can provide solutions for the people of the world. We are facing population growth with the well-founded expectation that there will be a 70% increase in demand for food by 2050. We have to provide answers to this problem, and research will play a role. It must also be able to offer increasing support to the demands of a clean environment. This means the rise in population must be accompanied by environmental protection, renewable energy and reduced levels of CO2 production.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as deputy member of the Committee on Fisheries, I am standing in for Mr Wałęsa who, unfortunately, is unable to attend this plenary.</p>
      <p sl="el">This report is extremely important to European research and innovation policy, because it aims to limit overlaps and wastage and to introduce standard European objectives and mechanisms for funding research and innovation. Numerous countries, including – unfortunately – my own, are still a long way off the target of 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2020 and this will, without doubt, result in a twin-track Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, when we speak of a deficit in research, we are not referring solely to high-tech sectors. It is also important, albeit not obvious, that we support research in the fisheries sector. Research and development activities in the neglected fisheries sector will bring about a more competitive, viable and modern fisheries sector and be of considerable benefit to Europeans who depend on fisheries.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality considers that female entrepreneurship ensures business dynamism and innovation and helps to increase the female employment rate, which is one of the basic aims of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, there is untapped female potential in the research and innovation sector. Female researchers experience discrimination, gender stereotypes, a ‘glass ceiling’ and ‘leaking pipeline’, insufficient funding and unequal opportunities for advancement. We are therefore calling for gender mainstreaming in the Common Strategic Framework and for proper funding of structural funds and cohesion policies, so that female researchers can develop innovative business plans, can participate in education and scientific programmes, have adequate mobility and can participate in networking platforms.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, we propose a gender equality action plan as part of the Common Strategic Framework, in order to guarantee a fairer allocation of funding on the basis of European Research Council research, indicators and information.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Ms Matias on her outstanding report and on the constructive collaboration that she established with the other political groups. It is with delight that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) sees its main proposals considered in this report. They are as follows: an increased budget for the next Research and Innovation Framework; the coordination of this framework with the Structural Funds; the inclusion of the stairway to excellence concept; the creation of conditions for industry and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to be more greatly involved; the promotion of young researcher participation; and the simplification of administrative and financial processes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Research and innovation are two fundamental pillars for economic development and job creation. Therefore, it is crucial to increase the portion of financing assigned to research and innovation within the global EU budget. This should be achieved by substantially increasing the framework programme and the percentage of the Structural Funds designated for this area.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The primary objective of the framework programme is to promote excellence and it must continue as such; however, the creation of the right conditions for the participation of small units or embryonic centres of excellence, such as small research groups and innovative companies, is equally important. In consideration of this objective, the report introduces the stairway to excellence concept.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In recognition of the fundamental role played by the business sector in job creation and economic development, the PPE Group welcomes the importance attributed to SMEs in this report. Unemployment amongst highly qualified young people is a curse in many EU countries; the participation of young people in research projects will be highly beneficial to this end.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, simplifying research and development access to the funds is essential in order to create a culture of confidence amongst all those involved, so as to strengthen research and innovation in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, I too would like to congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur, and thank them, also on behalf of the co-rapporteurs, for their effective work. I believe it is very important to set four strategic goals for ourselves, which I would like to outline here on behalf of the S&amp;D.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The first one is that heads of state and ministers should consider the EUR 80 billion targeted in the European Union’s next Multiannual Financial Framework as an investment, and not as a reserve fund from which money can be withdrawn occasionally. It is very important that investors and enterprises want to multiply this amount.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Our second strategic goal must be to achieve the Europe 2020 priorities. Let us not abandon these priorities for the sake of other research efforts, which, while important as well, are not critical from the perspective of the future of the European Union. If we have made a decision to build a green, energy efficient and intelligent economy, then our R&amp;D and innovation resources must also support this decision.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The third strategic goal is human resource management. We must do everything in our power to ensure that exceptional researchers born in the territory of the European Union are not forced to move north of the Pyrenees, or west of the Odra. Research and development capacities must be created in these countries as well, so that these researchers are able to reach the peak of their excellence in their own countries.</p>
      <p sl="hu">And finally, Commissioner, the European Parliament agreed that we need a new industrial policy. R&amp;D and innovation results obtained from these resources must be utilised in the territory of the EU with the horizontal and vertical cooperation of small, medium and large enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="en">World-class research funding needs to occur within a broader EU policy framework that supports economic growth and increases our global competitiveness. All too often, companies refer to conflicting policies in the EU. Last week I visited GE Healthcare in Wales where they research and commercialise state-of-the-art stem cell lines for pharmaceutical testing. The use of in vitro cell lines will provide a valuable alternative to animal testing but needs all 27 Member States to adopt a common set of rules for their use.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was also visited last week by the Cord Blood Association, which supports key EU research but believes that policies could be better coordinated so that a European depositary might be a reality in the future for medical research samples to rival the NIH in the US.</p>
      <p sl="en">A single set of rules would assist our research competitiveness, and interaction between leading industrial players in Europe and our academic institutions should be the norm as we pursue a competitive agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">For our research and innovation to be world class it must remain competitive and withstand at all times peer review.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, we would like to begin by saying that we share your enthusiasm over what you have managed to achieve so far, though of course we are still awaiting the final conclusions of the budget discussions. However, whatever the outcome, we feel that both the budget we are talking about, which has been substantially increased, and the simplified administrative rules, are two developments that will support a strong EU research and innovation policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our group would just like to draw your attention to two points. The first relates to the simplification of the rules: naturally, we feel that from the point of view of the Commission’s administration, it is important for the procedures to be simplified. However, I think that the main people to benefit from a simpler situation and procedures ought to be the end users, in other words all the various researchers and companies who apply to the Commission for help. We would therefore like to maintain a ‘customer-centred’ focus, so to speak, rather than an internal focus.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, it is certainly important for us to be able to bring the results of our research to market, and hence to be as good at innovation as we may become at research. We know that Europe needs to make progress on this front. However, we should avoid going too far in the opposite direction, in other words devoting the entire budget to innovation, especially if, through public-private partnerships or through direct subsidies to companies, we end up favouring companies that already have the resources to invest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must be careful of this; we must avoid what one might call a windfall effect and ensure we do not give companies that are able to invest in innovation an investment incentive they do not need.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the European Union is living with the failure of the Lisbon Strategy, which was supposed to have made Europe the most competitive and active knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. However, instead of Europe putting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy into practice, it is China that is doing so. In 2010, China’s public and private expenditure on research and development caught up with that of the European Union. In the very near future, China will have more engineers and researchers than the United States and the EU put together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Against this very worrying backdrop, Europe’s aerospace industry is the only sector that is still holding out, because France, Germany and Spain acted responsibly in this area, even though it was not easy for them, by investing in the long term and by not sticking to dogma on free, fair competition. It is true that Europe’s failure to do enough in the area of research is one of the causes of deindustrialisation in some parts of the EU. Whilst this report shows an element of lucidity, it falls far short of what it ought to be, especially in terms of its diagnosis of the causes of this alarming situation and the solutions it suggests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The crux of the problem is the lack of public investment in research, and the fact that it is subordinated to the financial markets’ aims and funding. It is also the fact that young researchers and engineers are in an insecure position and poorly paid, whilst parasitic financial professions, such as traders, earn scandalously high salaries, which amount to a reward for bad behaviour. Lastly, it is Europe’s failure to invest in developing a mass scientific and technical culture from the earliest age. It is becoming a matter of urgency for us to work towards incorporating know-how and knowledge as mainstream issues in society.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in publishing the Green Paper, the Commission has presented us with a vision defining the new common strategic framework for funding research and innovation after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The fact that EU countries are only investing about 1.5% of GDP in research, development and innovation means that the EU lags far behind its strong economic partners, and its policy in this area has so far failed to deliver the expected improvements.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary to attempt a reorganisation of current systems and programmes for supporting research, development and innovation. We find many suggestions for reorganisation in the submitted report. These include the new triple-tiered model proposed by the rapporteur, Ms Matias, for eliminating inequalities in the opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises to access and participate in the benefits of support for development and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Other suggestions include the simplification and greater transparency of mechanisms providing assistance, so that creative people are not discouraged by an excessive bureaucratic burden from making use of the EU’s available resources to speed up research and the exploitation of discoveries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that every suggestion that will help improve the effectiveness of European policy on supporting research must be implemented as quickly as possible, as the degree to which the EU lags behind the developed world in this area is critical and inexcusable.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Ms Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Ms Matias for this report and to our fellow Members who prepared the earlier reports, Ms Merkies and Ms Carvalho. This is a continuing process, and the day is approaching when we not only take political decisions here, but also have to demonstrate that we mean business when we say that research and innovation are crucial for the future viability of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am therefore very grateful that the representative of the Committee on Budgets also mentioned that adequate funding in this area is an important issue. We will shortly have to settle the dispute as to whether we have the power to make available the financial resources that are necessary to give this area of research and innovation a truly central importance. This is of key importance for the question of whether and how Europe will develop in future. Then, I might add, all the fine and grandiose soapbox speeches will not suffice. Instead, facts will need to be provided.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second comment that I would like to make is that we ourselves – and this point is developed very nicely in the report – will not be able to avoid looking very closely at whether we cannot use the resources that we have more effectively. How can we simplify the procedure? How can we achieve speed? How can we make research funding more effective? How can we obtain a stronger structure and greater simplification in what are sometimes still a confusing labyrinth of different types of research funding. Sometimes, less is more. Few projects but a lot of money invested will have a greater effect in the end. I am therefore grateful that we have taken things a step further once again with this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, the European Research Council and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology will have a particular role to play, and the area of small and medium-sized enterprises is clearly also an important one. However, last but not least, we must also have a solution for those States that have not yet got very far with regard to the promotion of excellence, which must be extremely compelling and also remain the only principle in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The idea of a possible competition with which we could perhaps boost new cutting-edge research centres in neighbouring regions also appears in this report. This is an important issue that still needs to be resolved.</p>

      <p sl="it">The efforts made to make the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development more favourable to small and medium-sized enterprises have not improved their participation rate. Simplification has not hit the target. As the report by Ms Matias clearly indicates, there is a need for administrative simplification and a significant reduction of financial reporting requirements. I also hope for extensive coordination and complementarity among the different research programmes and financing structures on an EU and national level, in order to avoid overlap and to encourage optimisation of resources.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, Commissioner, I think it is quite clear that innovation and technological progress are the driving force behind economic progress. However, in terms of the report as a whole, it should encourage us – or encourage me at least – to consider two issues in greater depth, two points I would like to mention and to give my opinion on here. Firstly, in relation to individual projects and their approval and support, a business plan and market potential are indeed positive factors to be considered, but they are not necessary preconditions for approval. What else, other than the market and market success, can encourage innovation and inventions? What parameters other than profit should be taken into account? There is nothing shameful about the words ‘profit’ and ‘market success’. On the contrary, they are the movers behind all progress. Secondly … and my time has just run out, which I greatly regret, but I shall respect my allocated minute.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, clearly it is good to invest in science and research, but when we allocate resources, we need to ensure at the same time that we do not control the research too centrally. This applies both to the content of research and to where it takes place.</p>
      <p sl="fi">No European central power can decide where innovations will emerge. That is why applicants for funding in the Member States have to be treated absolutely equally. This means that everyone must have the same opportunities to receive aid and be judged by the same criteria, but this does not necessarily mean that everyone will always receive the same amount. Innovation policy should not be confused with regional policy, because less successful projects must never be favoured at the expense of better ones, even if, statistically, different Member States may receive a different amount of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If we genuinely want innovation, and not something else, we need to support good ideas and high quality research in particular, and not consider regional and social policy, the geographical distribution of research, or levelling out the difference in income between Member States. These things are important too, but they are different issues and only serve to disrupt the real promotion of innovations.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Ms Matias for the work she has carried out. I have had the opportunity to collaborate with her on other reports, including those on innovation and falsified medicinal products, and the work has always been sound and intelligent, achieving excellent results.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that the interest the Commission and Parliament have shown in innovation and research marks a step forward in our work, and has led us, through a series of decisions, to target our demands correctly. They have also been taken up by the Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="it">The most important is greater funding, for which Parliament has decided to fight hard. Second is the conviction that the word research should now always be accompanied by the word innovation – meaning the niche that makes it possible to ensure that the product of the research also responds to market demands. The third highlighted element is Europe’s need to continually maintain and emphasise excellence, and to dedicate a tranche of its resources to research that more closely reflects the needs of its citizens and the area of small and medium-sized enterprises, meaning that level of research and innovation that creates a platform for the kind of innovative ideas that have always been a hallmark of our world, the world of research, the world of discovery.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe, therefore, that the work carried out so far is highly commendable. It should and will be completed only when funding has reached significant levels and when we respond to the need for administrative simplification, streamlined procedures and faster project assessment.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the new Common Strategic Framework being proposed can facilitate wider access to the funding programmes by simplifying the procedures involved and increasing the transparency that it provides. I would like to highlight one aspect which has been talked about less, and I am pleased that Mr Reul, Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, mentioned it here, that there are significant disparities in the European Union at Member State level in terms of research and innovation capacity, research infrastructure and industrial structure.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the current funding framework programme favours the countries at a more advanced level, which means that the disparities will grow ad infinitum .</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I think that cooperation on research and innovation must be stepped up between Member States at EU level, and cohesion funding must supplement the future framework programme. This will provide the countries lagging behind with increased access to the funds available, thereby allowing them also to develop effective projects.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur. We agree that funding for research helps us confront great challenges like health and ageing, and energy, food and water security, and we also agree that too often we have allowed bright ideas to be left in the lab or exploited elsewhere: so supporting innovation and development can help competitiveness and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through collaboration with industry, the EU research funding has encouraged significant private sector investment, and a balanced programme should support small companies and individual pockets of excellence while also recognising the crucial role played by larger companies and leading universities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must not dumb down excellence, and while Europe can complement Member States’ own programmes, it should not constrain them. Simplification remains key: less form-filling, more research. And Commissioner, just last week I met with many scientists in my region who raised serious questions about the impartiality of the peer review in certain sectors, so this is something we need to look at.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, while increasing the investment in research is welcome, I am afraid I do not support picking random figures out of thin air.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Madam President, I, too, would like to start by addressing financing. We all seem to concur that the research budget must be augmented. Several speakers have said today that EUR 80 billion would mean a considerable rise in the budget.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, I, personally, do not agree with this, because the Seventh Framework Programme cannot be directly compared with the Eighth Framework Programme. To be specific, the Eighth Framework Programme contains everything that the Seventh Framework Programme does, but it also contains the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, the programme for innovation and competition, research that is currently covered by other appropriations, and probably some other things as well.</p>
      <p sl="sl">If the proposed financial perspective is cut during the negotiations, it will demonstrate that increased funding for research is not a European priority, contrary to what has often been said by Council representatives.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Secondly, I would like to address the issue of disproportional geographical distribution. This is typically explained away by the fact that scientific excellence is the main criterion for project selection. There is nothing wrong with that and, indeed, that is absolutely fine. However, we have to define scientific excellence in terms which will apply to small and large-scale projects alike.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Scientific excellence is not just a characteristic of large-scale, multi-million projects. Often, it will also be in evidence in small-scale projects. The next framework programme should, therefore, support such projects, too.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Thirdly, it is a fact that research quality varies between individual Member States and, what is more, between regions. I agree that Structural Funds projects should be used to lessen the gap between the current state of research quality and research excellence.</p>
      <p sl="sl">One last thing: the analysis carried out by the European Research Council (ERC) paints the same picture. The results show that projects are, by and large, awarded to large Member States and better-known universities. One of the researchers has told me that, judging by the current situation, the programme should be called Fame, not Ideas. We need to change the criteria so that the idea counts the most and, as far as researchers’ qualifications are concerned, they need to give us an assurance that the project will be implemented.</p>

We call for the procedures for accessing European research and innovation funds and programmes to be simplified.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Common Strategic Framework for funding research and innovation must be based on coordinating the research programmes of the European Union and Member States. It must find solutions to the global challenges facing society, such as demographic changes, sustainable management of resources and a sound, stable and equitable economic base. The participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in R&amp;D&amp;I collaborative projects should exceed the 15% mark. This is why it is vital to simplify procedures and remove the administrative barriers in order to achieve this target and get industry involved as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, to begin with, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for attempting to work out a mutual compromise. The European Parliament has agreed to consolidate all EU financial instruments for scientific research and innovation so that in future planning will cover all common strategic frameworks. I agree that this solution will contribute not only to a strengthening of European competitiveness on the international stage, but will also help considerably in simplifying and speeding up the grant application process for beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, we can see considerable differences between the Member States, which can be seen primarily in the different levels of expenditure on research and innovation and in the different levels of access to scientific infrastructure. Please note that line which marks this very clear contrast runs between the Member States which were part of what is called the old EU and the new Member States. The application of a standardised set of administrative, financial, organisational and information procedures, and forcing the harmonisation of principles and conditions of participation in various programmes to create a common and transparent system in the framework of the European research space is in the interest of all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should also be added that the proposal to improve the representation of some Member States at European level by trying to make use of the potential of all areas of the EU seems to be fully justified, in that it will eliminate the threat of fragmentation and strengthen the principles of excellence in criteria such as the effect on integration, cost-effectiveness and fair pay. I support the need for maintaining an open system of cross-border scientific cooperation, but I consider the issue of the framework programme’s budget as a matter for open debate.</p>

Finally, it must be a programme that promotes a one-speed, single European research area, as has already been highlighted twice here, that is, blurring the differences between Member States.</p>

I would therefore like to ask, when it comes to the European Union’s own resources, for example with regard to the emissions trading revenue for the CO2 problem areas, could we not draw up a common programme with the national finance ministers so that these resources can only be spent to provide European added value, namely to provide research and innovation in respect of CO2 and global warming in an appropriate scientific manner?</p>

      <p sl="es">Secondly, I believe that what Europe needs is human resources. Large projects should be tied to a scholarship programme so that more grant holders can go to large universities and institutes to receive training.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think both the Structural Funds and this system should pay less attention to buildings – Europe has a plentiful supply of buildings but is indeed lacking in human resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also believe, Commissioner, that you will find you have the full support of Parliament if Member States are also required, through the European Research Area (ERA), to simplify their procedures. Europe’s efforts at simplification should be met with transparent procedures on the part of the Member States, which will have to commit themselves, given that they will be receiving money.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, you will have Parliament’s full support if we aim to achieve simple, transparent Council procedures.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, I offer my compliments to Ms Matias for her report. If, immediately after the crisis, we are going to talk less about the growth agenda than about the crisis itself, then this really will have to be an explosion. Unfortunately that is not what will happen, it seems to me, as, with one thing or another, the growth agenda, the innovation agenda is still not high enough up the priorities list. Well, fortunately it is in your case, Commissioner, but the same does not yet apply to everyone.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We always talk about research, above all, as the source of growth, but it is not just research, it is the whole of society, it is a mindset, it is, more than anything, the business environment. Yes, we need to sow the seeds of growth, but that does not mean that we have to go and spray those seeds around willy-nilly. We need to sow those seeds in precisely the right way. What does that mean? Well, it means not fixating on research. It means paying a great deal of attention to start-ups, simplification, cutting red tape, easier access to funding and, above all, to the business climate, where other Commissioners, too, need to get involved in those areas that are not really within your portfolio. That means the internal market, creating a sound framework for consumption through the common strategic framework. It does indeed need to be ‘common’, but that means in common with the whole of the Commission and all of the Member States. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, we are all aware that the European Union has set its target to increase spending on research and innovation to 3% of the EU’s GDP by 2020. However, as not all Member States will manage to meet this target successfully, I think that an integrated strategic approach is required to research and innovation as part of the 2020 strategy in order to increase public and private investments in this area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I think that the European Commission should adopt an approach that maximises the relevant synergies from the Common Strategic Framework for research and innovation, the European Fund for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Structural Funds. A strategy must be adopted based on as many additional funds as possible, which is aimed at research and innovation at regional level and supports the development of the institutional capacity of the regions intending to adopt research and innovation policies.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, firstly, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for an excellent and important report. When speaking of research and development, we also always have to consider how we can create jobs and promote European competitiveness. To achieve this, we need to be able to make business and industry a more successfully integrated part of research policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Furthermore, we must remember that, although it is very important that we invest in excellence in cutting-edge research, we must also invest in research that creates innovations rooted in practice.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If we consider funding, we can support innovations rooted in practice which emerge at the customer interface, largely also via the Structural Funds. It is therefore important that, in the future and during the forthcoming financial period, we should be able to lower the barriers with regard to funding for Framework Programmes, as well as the Structural Funds.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, if we look at the value chain for a product – in other words, invention, production and marketing – amidst international competition, we can discover the following. The second step, in other words the production, has largely been relocated to Asia. The added value in Europe is based on research, development and marketing.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we want to maintain this standard, we must provide adequate resources for research, particularly during the economic crisis. If we lose our innovation capacity, we will move ever closer towards a recession. Although synergies between the existing subsidies are to be welcomed, they must be evaluated separately. Large projects like Galileo should be entered on a separate project line and should not be a burden on the research and innovation budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">The research and development funds need to be substantially increased and used in synergy with the Structural and Cohesion Funds. All investment is pointless if the individual States do not do their part and the standards and quality criteria for school education are not improved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is self-evident that research and development need to be facilitated in all States. They are more and more necessary when our economies are subjected to unfair competition from low-wage emerging economies. The only way in which the high-wage developed world can hope to compete with these emerging economies is to be ahead of them in new technology. However, the benefits of this research and innovation will be blunted if the fruits of the research are not protected by an effective patents system, preferably in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Emerging economies in the Far East are the worst offenders for copying western technology in blatant disregard of patent rights. JCB, the manufacturer of excavation machinery, has had to take action against three Far Eastern manufacturers for product copying. The manufacturers in question were brazenly exhibiting copied products at the Bauma construction equipment show in Munich.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate Ms Matias on this report. Globally, Europe is the richest region, but the United States, Japan and the BRIC countries invest significantly more in innovation, research and development.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the investment volume in Europe has increased, when it comes to achieving the objective of a total investment of 3% of GDP by 2020, only six Member States have so far achieved more than 2%.</p>
      <p sl="de">Knowledge is definitely a public good. Accordingly, the social aspects and impacts on society of research and innovation need to be taken into account. In this regard, particular attention must be paid to small and medium-sized enterprises. Support must be given in particular to female researchers in order to take gender equality into account.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very encouraged by the debate that has unfolded here. In answer to comments by Mr Rübig and others in relation to the budget, obviously I am in the hands of Parliament and the Council. Certainly, from what I have heard this evening, I think that Parliament will be a very strong ally in support of an increased budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">By way of conclusion, let me give you some flavour of how we think Horizon 2020 should be organised. It will be structured around three distinct but mutually reinforcing blocks, in line with Europe 2020 priorities. The first block, ‘Excellence in the science base’, will strengthen the EU’s excellence in science. The second, ‘Tackling societal challenges’, will respond directly to the challenges identified in Europe 2020. The third block, ‘Creating industrial leadership and competitive frameworks’, will support business, research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Matias, I know these blocks do not correspond to the ‘three layers’ in your report, but I hope you will agree that the components are there and the objectives are the same. Implementation will be simplified and standardised, with simplification covering both funding schemes and rules. Key aspects will include a rationalised set of funding schemes, a single set of rules, earlier project start dates and further externalisation. The administrative burden on participants will be reduced through a radically simplified cost reimbursement approach. This will be based on the broadest possible acceptance of participants’ accounting practices and a greater use of lump sums and flat rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">The negotiation and selection phases will be shortened to allow projects to start earlier. Simpler guidance and advisory services will be provided through both a single IT portal and one-stop-shop support structures in the national language. There will be a clear differentiation between the objectives and modes of intervention of Horizon 2020 and those of the cohesion policy funds, to ensure complementarities and synergies. Horizon 2020 will allocate funds on the basis of excellence, regardless of geographical location. Cohesion policy funds will focus on research and innovation capacity-building through pre-allocated envelopes for eligible regions. European Regional Development Fund funding should support the development of smart specialisation strategies and should provide a ‘stairway to excellence’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Based on these key principles, the Commission will now develop its proposals for presentation by the end of this year. The proposals would have not been possible without your enriching report. All the issues that have been addressed this evening and have been addressed in the report will certainly be looked at very seriously and taken into account by myself and my services over the coming weeks.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, I should like to start by thanking all those who offered comments during this very interesting debate; I would also like to add that it is evident that this report is not an island within this Parliament, and I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr Reul for having drawn our attention to this.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It already forms part of a series of reports addressing research that point towards a series of common actions; they include the Carvalho report, the Merkies report, the Audy report – the author of which is not present today – and a series of parliamentary recommendations that address the same issues. This report provides some additional dimensions that I believe should be considered, given the debate that we have had here; however, there is a series of parliamentary recommendations, as I mentioned, that address the same issues.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, I would truly appreciate the Commission taking into account the recommendations of this House, the house of democracy. Research, innovation and development are obviously not insignificant matters: they comprise the third largest part of the European budget, after agriculture and cohesion. These aspects evidently represent a fundamental area for economic growth and job creation, and at this point I would like to stress again: quality jobs. We must put an end to this problem of job insecurity for researchers in many parts of Europe, and particularly for young researchers, an issue that has also been reinforced here. Additionally, another dimension I would like to see addressed is that of small and medium-sized enterprises. I do not have time to mention all the issues, so I will limit myself to these.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commissioner is aware that my initial proposal was to create a European Investment Bank for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as they represent 80 to 90% of our industrial fabric and they do not have the same conditions of access. We reached the compromise of establishing a specific branch within the European Investment Bank dedicated to SMEs and I sincerely hope that we reflect on what public investment and public funding are for, as that is what we are talking about.</p>
      <p sl="pt">They are for research units, research centres, universities and other partners; they have been used for large companies, but they have not been used very much for small and medium-sized enterprises. This is one of the errors that without a doubt must be corrected and reinforced during the next financial framework: increasing the budget assigned to this area.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Europe is one of the most developed regions of the world. However, some emerging countries have already overtaken us where investments in research, development and innovation are concerned. It is undeniable that the volume of European investments has increased, but even so, we are still using only a fraction of the EU’s innovative potential.</p>
      <p sl="hu">There are still significant differences between some countries; new Member States have access to only a fraction of resources. We must implement structural changes to increase the competitiveness of the EU. In my opinion, there are two tasks of critical importance.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I would highlight the simplification of administration as the first and most critical task. An overly complicated administration is costly, and makes participation of SMEs more difficult. Getting rid of parallel structures and providing quicker access to tender funds contributes considerably to an ever-increasing number of actors becoming interested in R&amp;D activities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree that the second task must be the application of an excellence-based approach, as we can use the financial resources of the Framework Programme most effectively if we select the research projects to be supported on the basis of excellence. However, we need to have a more diverse approach in the future, because new Member States do not have a research background infrastructure which would allow them to meet excellence-based criteria. Therefore we must create financing methods which promote the development of infrastructures that are lagging behind. This is how we can provide equal terms for each Member State in instances of excellence-based evaluations.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Research, development and innovation are a driving force in the area of job creation, boosting standards at universities and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is precisely for these reasons that research and development is one of the central elements of the 2020 strategy. As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I consider the funding of research and development to be extremely important. The US sets an example for the European Union in the area of research and development – and even though the US is way ahead, we all know that the EU’s aim is to narrow the gap. Unfortunately, we have not been very successful in recent years. If we want to remain competitive in today's globalised world, we must not undervalue this area. I therefore fully support the call to create a pan-European fund to promote cooperation in research, and at the same time I would like to draw attention to the importance of the objective of spending 3% of GDP on research and development.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The Green Paper published by the European Commission, outlining a common strategic framework for research and innovation funding, marks an important step in terms of achieving the targets for sustainable, smart and inclusive growth. I feel that the integrated approach outlined in it for using the various European programmes and funds will help make the funding of scientific and innovation projects more effective and efficient, and will increase their added value.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, I think that additional efforts are required to ensure the broader inclusion of participants from every Member State in this process and to make the financial resources more accessible. The lack of experience with European programmes, the lack of information available in most EU languages, the complex application procedures, the execution of and reporting on projects, as well as access to cofinancing resources are some of the problems which hamper research environments and businesses from showcasing their potential, especially in the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I also want to stress the need for a closer link between scientific research and the needs of the business sector, as well as for an improvement in the access SMEs have to scientific research and innovations. I think that this would give the maximum boost to the European economy’s competitiveness and create new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I think that this is a highly important debate today on this report. Allow me to quote some of the facts: in April 2011, the European Union signed an agreement granting free access to Palestinian imports to the European market of agricultural products and fish and processed agricultural and fishery products. This agreement abolishes duty on imports of agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and Palestinian fishery products. We would point out that these provisions do not apply to fruit and vegetables, for which the system remains the same.</p>
      <p sl="el">This agreement will run for a period of 10 years. In five years’ time it will be reviewed and may be renewed. It should be noted that, today, the Palestinian Authority is the Union’s smallest trade partner in the area. For the year 2009, according to Commission statistics, the rate of transactions was EUR 56.6 million, out of which only six million reflected imports from the Palestinian Authority. During the first trimester of 2010 a rise was observed of 26% in Union exports and 32% in Palestinian Authority exports.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is clear to us that the future of the region depends on its economic development. Trade is a mechanism that contributes significantly to the reduction of poverty and to political stability. Data from the World Bank illustrate that most of the population is living in severe poverty. The illegal settlements repeatedly condemned by the European Union play a significant role in this.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Union is the biggest provider of aid to the Palestinian Authority and one of Israel’s basic trading partners. Therefore, it has every interest in persuading both sides to sit at the negotiating table in order to create a viable Palestinian state which will co-exist in peace with Israel. This is also needed in light of the tense atmosphere in the entire Arab world and, in the run-up to the debate to be held in plenary tomorrow afternoon, I believe that it would be a good idea if the European Parliament could maintain a unified stance on the Palestinian question which, after all these years, deserves a fair solution.</p>
      <p sl="el">To come back to the agreement, I believe that it is very important to the Palestinian side. It is an important message to the Palestinian Authority, especially at the present moment in time, and should be approved immediately and implemented immediately. This is important to peace and stability in the area as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Ms Koppa, honourable Members, this is an agreement which, whilst it will not solve the region’s problems on its own, certainly presents opportunities that we ought to make the most of.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The new agreement, which the European Union signed with the Palestinian Authority on 13 April 2011, gives free access to the European market for all agricultural, processed agricultural and fisheries products from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with the exception of the fruit and vegetables sector, as Ms Koppa mentioned, for which the EU has kept the entry price system. This means that there is partial protection in place during certain important periods for EU producers, whilst the rest of the time Palestinian products can be exported to the EU. This unilateral concession by the European Union has been granted on a provisional basis for a ten-year period, after which there is the opportunity to extend the agreement, depending on Palestine’s future economic development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The agreement also includes a review clause, whereby five years after it came into force, the conditions of the agreement may be reviewed and its scope widened if necessary.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The agreement also contains an ‘anti-fraud’ clause providing for temporary withdrawal of the trade preferences, which is intended to ensure that only Palestinian products benefit from this preferential agreement. I know that, during the discussion within the Committee on International Trade, some of you raised the concern that other people might benefit from the agreement. I think this clause should deal with that concern.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This agreement is one of the most generous that the EU has ever signed in the field of agriculture. It is justified by the politico-economic situation and the specific circumstances surrounding Palestine’s agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Palestinian Authority is the EU’s smallest trade partner in the Euro-Mediterranean region. EU exports to Palestine were worth EUR 57.5 million in 2009 and EUR 89.3 million in 2010. At the same time, EU imports from Palestine were worth only EUR 6.5 million in 2009, and EUR 9.3 million in 2010. Opening the market to this region should provide a means of supporting economic development in occupied Palestinian territory, and at the same time give a significant boost to Palestine’s agricultural sector and to farmers’ businesses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Alongside the introduction of additional trade preferences, the EU will be offering a technical trade assistance programme. In fact, this assistance has already started in the areas of health and plant health, and will continue according to the Palestinians’ future needs and requests.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Commissioner, the agreement between the EU and the Palestinian Authority comes at a very important and highly symbolic moment when we are dealing with the issue of Palestinian statehood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regardless of whether the Palestinian people obtain their legitimate statehood in the coming months or some time later, the state of their economy will be a crucial factor which will determine whether there can be sustainable peace between Palestine and Israel. For it is naive to expect that the population will be peaceful and law-abiding when most of its people do not have bread on their table and their children must live in poverty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Currently, the level of trade between the EU and the Palestinian Territories is extremely low. We can therefore expect that the agreement we are discussing today and will be voting on tomorrow will have a substantial impact on the Palestinian economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we should also think about other ways to increase our bilateral trade, especially by improving the conditions of market access for Palestinian exports to the EU. This would certainly be beneficial to all parties concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, allow me on a final note to mention that while we are about to approve a trade agreement with the Palestinian Authority, for more than a year Parliament has been keeping on hold an agreement on conformity assessment and acceptance of industrial products (ACAA) between the EU and Israel. We will be granting trade preferences to the Palestinian territories, parts of which are ruled by a terrorist organisation, Hamas, but at the same time we are blocking a technical agreement with Israel, which is not acceptable at all.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to congratulate Maria Koppa for the fine job she has done and to express support, on behalf of my political group, for the position favouring the agreement between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on the liberalisation of trade in agricultural and fisheries products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Our debate is taking place at a time when changes are occurring to a process which has gone through, so far, decades of bloody stalemate. In light of this, the decision to facilitate access for Palestinian exports to the internal market conveys the European Union’s determination to make an active contribution to the process of building a functional economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Economic and political aspects are interdependent in the relations between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority. A fragile economy, extreme poverty and huge unemployment are factors which fuel the potential for conflict in the region. Encouraging trade means that we are not only helping to reduce poverty, but also to strengthen political institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Palestinian Territories’ economic development also depends on products originating from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank gaining access to the European market. When implementing this agreement, it is important to focus particular attention on the regulations concerning origin. In this regard, the judgment made by the European Court of Justice on the Brita case on 25 February 2010 is applicable, whereby the Palestinian authorities are deemed to be the only authorities able to issue the documents confirming the provenance of products manufactured on the Gaza Strip and West Bank.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support and thank the rapporteur for the outstanding work she has accomplished in committee, sometimes in circumstances that can hardly be described as relaxed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Trade between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority is minimal. We are certainly a long way from achieving the full potential of this relationship, and who knows when we will also be able to implement the sections relating to fishing, considering the dual illegality the Gaza Strip is subject to: the illegality of the blockade by the Israelis and the illegality of the control exercised by Hamas over the Strip.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we are finally taking full responsibility for our relations, we are making international trade a fully-fledged instrument of foreign policy and above all we recognise the Palestinian Authority as a negotiating partner with full rights. Paradoxically we are doing this while at the same time, at the UN headquarters in New York, we are dragging our feet on the question of recognising its independence.</p>
      <p sl="it">Let us now hope for rapid implementation with good will shown by all sides. This should include ensuring we do not grant the products of the Jewish colonies any kind of special trade privileges, either as products declared as Israeli or as Palestinian products.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, we have before us a proposal to give producers of agricultural and fishery products in the Palestinian territories preferential trade terms. I will vote in favour of this proposal in order to make it easier for Palestinian farmers and fishermen to make a living. We need not link the entire Middle East conflict directly to this proposal, however, as we are currently seeing happen in the Committee on International Trade. There is another dossier in play, namely an agreement between the European Union and Israel on standards in the pharmaceuticals industry. It is astounding that some Members of this House are trying to bring this agreement to a standstill in order to put pressure on Israel to accept the unilateral acts of the Palestinian Authority at the United Nations. For me, that smacks of double standards, and I find it utterly irresponsible and unacceptable. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I rise to speak in favour of Ms Koppa’s resolution. Like many others, I have witnessed the twists and turns in the quest for Palestinian statehood in the United Nations, and like many others I wish them well and hope for a fair and just solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">In speaking today on the Koppa report it is, for me, not a question of being anti-Israel or pro-Palestine. No: it is more one of championing justice and fair play. We must hope that peace soon comes to this troubled region.</p>
      <p sl="en">I spent a few days in the Gaza Strip this summer seeing for myself the abject poverty in which Gazans have to live. I listened to the pleas of mothers and fathers unable to feed or educate their children properly, and of doctors and workers who have to work with the most basic of materials. I listened to teachers and their students, refugees and NGOs, and I heard countless stories of stalled business deals, of jobs lost through lack of raw materials, of social breakdown and the strangulation of trade by the Israeli blockade. It became very clear to me that in Gaza and in the West Bank economic recovery and social recovery go hand in hand.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have some misgivings in our Group about the nature of the agreement, the dislocation of development in social and environmental protection, and some of the practical difficulties around identifying the sources of products. The Koppa report will not solve all the problems between Israel and Palestine; but it is an important marker along the way. As the rapporteur states, opening the EU market to Palestinian products is only the first stage in the construction of a Palestinian state. I urge you to join us in the vote tomorrow in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this agreement, as a result of which Palestinian agricultural products will now actually be placed on an equal footing with products from other, recognised states in the Mediterranean. I expressly agree with the rapporteur – and I would like to thank her for her work – when she says that this Agreement can help, to a certain degree, to support and strengthen the Palestinian economy, which is currently in crisis, irrespective of the aspects of this Agreement that are still unresolved, to which my fellow Members have referred.</p>
      <p sl="de">How is a permanent peace solution with Israel to be possible if there is no self-supporting economic development in the future state of Palestine, which also is and must be the basis for further democratisation and an embedding of Palestinian society in the region as a whole – I would like to emphasise this point – for dealing with such complex problems as demographic issues, job creation, issues relating to water supply, the construction of housing, and so on, in a constructive and positive way? I also see this as an important signal in view of the current debate in the United Nations with regard to the long overdue recognition of the state of Palestine. Trade policy – and this is specifically addressed to you – can create specific circumstances here that would signify a tangible improvement in living conditions for the local people. That also involves us taking on specific responsibility for the Arab Spring this autumn. This Agreement can surely only be a first step towards comprehensive trade cooperation as partners.</p>
      <p sl="de">In light, in particular, of the important global political decision, however, I would also like, here in plenary, to explicitly express my amazement at the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). Up until just before the vote in committee, it threatened to reject the Agreement. As the price for its consent in the Committee on International Trade, it forced the deletion from Parliament’s explanatory statement of the reference to the settlements and blockades by Israel being partly to blame for the poverty and unemployment in Palestine. Shutting our eyes to reality is not a valid position to take, and the facts and challenges still remain. The same applies to the question of the deletion of the passage relating to the circumvention of the rules of origin by Israeli manufacturers. We will not solve the problem by not allowing a spade to be called a spade.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it goes without saying that I wish the agricultural sector and the fishing sector in the Palestinian territories all the best. In light of that I have not the slightest difficulty – the opposite is the case, in fact – with this agreement. What I do have difficulty with, however – and other Members have mentioned this already – is the blockade that those on the left of the House have erected against the trade agreement with Israel, and the fact that they have been doing so for over a year already.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I do still also find the rapporteur’s explanatory statement problematic. She said to me in the Committee on International Trade that she would not alter it at all, and she has been true to her word. However, I can still see a number of serious flaws. There are four very specific flaws that I would like to mention at this point because they actually besmirch Israel’s name and are also irrelevant to this report. First of all, Palestinian exporters choose of their own accord to work with Israeli export facilities and operate in Jordan and Egypt because of corruption. Secondly, the regulation of products from the settlements – and I am sure you will have heard this too, Mr Cioloş – is being enforced to the satisfaction of the European Commission. Thirdly, the Palestinian Authority has itself voluntarily chosen to form part of the customs envelope with Israel because of all the advantages that it currently enjoys through all the customs agreements that Israel has concluded with third countries. Finally, Mr President, apart from investors from Iran or from Arab countries that have no official relations with Israel, it is possible for every investor to obtain a visa, contrary to what the rapporteur claims.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Agreement is, without doubt, a question of us taking a step together towards improving the everyday life of the people in the Palestinian Territories. Trade can – as in many other examples, too – play a part in this. However, we should not overestimate the value of trade here. This Agreement will hopefully improve the situation, but it will not happen automatically. After all, all of the questions that lie behind this: who will actually conduct the trade? Which companies are involved? Who will retain the money? Will the money actually find its way into the pockets of workers and local people in need, or will it make certain cliques that also exist in these territories richer? All of these are questions to which we, unfortunately, cannot provide any answers here.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there is something that I believe is important – and several previous speakers have already mentioned this: it annoys me how distinctions are regularly made by some fellow Members on the left of the House here and attempts are always made to heap the blame for the unfortunate and surely unbearable situation between Israel and the Palestinians onto one side.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the many decades that we have already had to witness this conflict make it clear that the blame certainly does not lie exclusively with one side and that we cannot simply say that one side are the good guys and the other the villains that have to make all the possible concessions. That will get us nowhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, Mr Schulz, when you say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) imposed one or two conditions in committee, it was quite definitely – and we said this repeatedly in committee – not our intention to call this Agreement into question. Quite the opposite. However, our issue with this was that, if things have been portrayed in an extremely simplified way in an explanatory statement to such a resolution – the explanatory statement simply portrayed the matter as if only the Israelis were to blame for the situation – there must be some way of amending it.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to the rapporteur for the fact that we found a positive solution together, because it is also the case here that our preferences clearly lean towards the Palestinians, including in the areas governed by Hamas. Where Israel and the Agreement are concerned, I think that the other side is also called on to make some headway here.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt this is not purely a trade agreement. This agreement clearly contains a significant element of ‘political’ assistance. This does not involve treating Palestine and Israel in the same way; it is clear that their situations are different. The agreement with Israel is purely a trade agreement, a trade agreement that in some way supports a process leading to the constitution of a state, a process that brings improvements in the living conditions experienced by that population.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, the trade agreement with Europe has until now been mediated by Israel, and the result is one where imports form one tenth and exports nine tenths of our international trade. That means that we have seen, or rather, until now Europe has seen Palestine as a market and certainly not a place where producers should be encouraged to target the European market. It is my belief then, with compliments to Ms Koppa, that in this international context we would be doing the right thing tomorrow by using the vote in Parliament to send a strong, authoritative message that will help drive the process at the UN and the Warsaw meeting at the end of the month.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I think it is a very welcome proposal for us to now grant duty-free access to agricultural and fishery products from the Palestinian regions.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the one hand, it can be thought of as a well-defined proposal. It is, after all, the smallest trading area that the EU has any kind of agreement with in this way. On the other hand, however, it is very symbolic, as some of the debate here today is demonstrating.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Perhaps right now especially, when we see that the Palestinian Authority is attempting to achieve unilateral recognition in the United Nations, although I, personally, have my doubts as to whether that really will be able to establish peace and security in the region.</p>
      <p sl="sv">On the other hand, however, the decision that we will take tomorrow will be able to make a difference. By opening the way for trade, economic development and prosperity, we will also be providing prospects for the future for those who currently lack them, and that is the most important step towards establishing security and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It requires Israel’s cooperation, however. A lot of what the Palestinians currently export is controlled in practice by Israeli export authorities, and cooperating to ensure prosperity in the Palestinian territories is extremely important for Israel’s security.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The European Parliament should bear in mind that what we are now doing for the Palestinian side should, of course, also be done for the Israelis. It is not the case that the Israelis will lose out if the Palestinians receive better trade prospects, or that the Palestinians will lose out if the Israelis receive better trade prospects.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Therefore, we clearly ought to get out of the stupid political deadlock we are in when it comes to Acre and also approve an Israeli agreement, because trade produces prosperity, development and prospects for the future. These are things that both the Palestinians and the Israelis need.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, it is urgent and indeed imperative to break the blockade Israel is imposing on Palestine and its people in defiance of international law and all the relevant UN resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In proposing that this agreement be approved, the Commission, nonetheless, cannot ignore the reality on the ground – a reality which, as heard here today, is one of a brutal and illegal occupation that along with many other factors is creating innumerable obstacles to Palestinian exports and imports, quite aside from the daily obstructions to and restrictions on the movement of people and goods.Furthermore, this agreement necessarily raises another question: namely, trade relations between the European Union and the State of Israel, it being no secret, indeed it is known full well, that products originating in the Israeli settlements enter the European market under this agreement – under existing agreements with Israel – despite the fact that more than a decade ago the Commission itself held that no settlement in the occupied territories could be considered Israeli territory.In the face of this well-known problem the Commission is dumping this problem on the Member States and abrogating its own responsibilities. All of this ultimately underscores that it is more than time to recognise the independence of the State of Palestine in accordance with the petition presented to the United Nations by the Palestinian National Authority as an indispensable step towards the just resolution of this conflict according to international law.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would just like to stress the point I made at the beginning: this agreement is an opportunity. It will certainly not solve all the region’s problems, and is certainly not the only means the EU has at its disposal of making a positive contribution to clarifying the situation in this region.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, this is a real, concrete opportunity, and of course it is up to the Palestinian Authority, and now the Palestinian people, to seize it. I see that Mr Ferreira has already left the House. There was what one might call a provocative element in what he said, which, in any case, calls for clarification on the issue of origin.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want to be clear about this. Through the agreement it has signed with Israel and the agreement it is currently negotiating with the Palestinian Authority, the European Commission aims to ensure that products originating from Israeli colonies on occupied Palestinian territory do not enter the EU. Both the agreement with Palestine currently submitted for Parliament’s approval and the agreement with Israel contain clear safeguards, in that certificates of origin are required both for products originating from Israel and for those originating from Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards Israeli fruit and vegetables, for which Israel is obliged to provide controls on origin, we even go so far as to request the code of the site where the products were produced, so that EU customs authorities can perform their own controls. This is not a way of transferring responsibility from the Commission to Member States, since responsibility for border control lies with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission has created the necessary instruments to allow Member States and their customs authorities to do their job. In the agreement we are presenting to you now, we also have a safeguard in the form of the certificate of origin, which only the Palestinian Authority can issue for Palestinian Products destined for the EU. This will ensure that the instructions on paper are also adhered to in practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, therefore, I repeat that I am not saying we should have this kind of relationship only with Palestine and not with Israel; however, I think the agricultural trade relations scenario with Palestine that we are currently submitting for your approval contains the necessary elements to reassure us that what is said on paper will be adhered to on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for his very important explanations on that last point. We held a long discussion in committee as to how the origin of products from the settlements will in fact be established because, as far as numerous colleagues are concerned, both in my and in other political groups, these products come from the settlements and we would be rewarding illegal settlement. These clarifications are indeed reassuring and we thank you for them.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the end of this debate, I should like to thank my colleagues for the debate and for the truly huge opportunity that this report and the agreement reached give the Palestinian people. I believe that the entire House agrees that this agreement is the first step towards the development and prosperity of a people which has suffered immensely over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="el">The principle on which this report is based is that it must not become an agreement that holds hostage other agreements that need to move forward on a separate track.

      <p sl="en">I support this new trade agreement with the Palestinian Authority which will give farm and fishery produce from Palestine duty free access to the European market. The Palestinian Authority is the EU’s smallest trading partner: exports from the two territories to the EU totalled just EUR 6.1 million in 2009. The trade agreement has the potential to help the region to develop economically. However, there remain two serious obstacles to economic development. Firstly, the illegal blockade of Gaza suffocates economic life there reducing a population of 1.5 million to a subsistence existence dependent on an under-funded UNRWA for food, work and education. Secondly, there are serious ‘origin’ concerns about products manufactured in Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land gaining access to the European market under the EU-Israel Trade Agreement. Following the ECJ 2010 ruling on the Brita case, the customs authorities of the importing Member States may refuse to grant the preferential treatment provided for under the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement where the goods concerned originate in settlements.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Agreement under discussion will certainly help the development of the Palestinian economy through the duty-free import of Palestinian agricultural products onto the EU market and it will therefore also facilitate the export of Palestinian products to the EU. In this respect, it represents an important boost for the Palestinian economy, which is currently experiencing a crisis. The situation in the Palestinian Territories is a cause for concern – according to data provided by the World Bank – on account of the severe poverty and unemployment. However, a sound economic basis is a fundamental requirement for a viable Palestinian state and for peace in the Middle East. It is therefore also in the interests of Israel in particular to support this development. From this point of view, the construction of the separation wall in the West Bank represents a significant obstacle and must be abandoned immediately wherever the immediate security interests of Israel are not affected. The non-tariff barriers to trade established by Israel also represent a similar obstacle. In any case, I welcome the approach chosen in the report to insist on the exact designation of origin of the products.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Parliament and all my colleagues for starting a parliamentary discussion on deeper trade ties between the EU and Taiwan, including the possibility of a bilateral free trade agreement in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taiwan is an important trade partner, but our trade relationship has recently performed well below its potential. Large gains for European companies can be expected in terms of exports of goods and services, as well as foreign direct investments. Taiwan also plays a very important role in the global supply chains of information and communication technologies. The European ICT sector is itself heavily dependent on the Taiwanese supply of high-end components and contract manufacturing.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, the Taiwanese export structure does not threaten some of Europe’s most sensitive exports, such as automobiles and agriculture. What is more, the EU can also gain from a triangular trade, including Taiwan and China, since European firms, especially in the ICT sector, have already expressed their interest in using Taiwan as a high-value hub in greater China and the wider East Asian supply chains.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to dwell on aspects related to Taiwan’s political status. You may know that Taiwan has the status of an independent customs territory. It has been a full member of the WTO since 2002 as well as a full member of APEC and the Asian Development Bank. Therefore closer economic ties do not contradict the EU’s ‘One China’ policy. At the same time, we must recognise that Taiwan is already negotiating an FTA with Singapore. New Zealand, India, Indonesia and the Philippines will be next. The EU should therefore be in line with these processes and consider launching FTA negotiations with Taiwan.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as one of the authors of this oral question, I also strongly believe that this is the ideal time to assess our economic and trade relations with Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taiwan is the world number one in the high tech industry; it is the EU’s fourteenth biggest trade partner, and has seen growth of 10.8% following its economic recovery in 2010. In Taipei, 30% of the population hold a university degree, and inflation in the country is low, with a rate of 1% in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU is the island’s largest investor, with investments worth USD 1.2 billion in 2010. As Ms Andrikienė just pointed out, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with mainland China, and the beginning of negotiations for cooperation agreements with other Asia-Pacific countries, are both aimed at bringing Taipei in on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) process in Asia, but also at promoting its international integration in terms of trade. These are positive signs for the EU, and a ‘second generation’ agreement with Taiwan will in future establish links with cross-strait supply chains and give European businesses greater access to the Asia-Pacific markets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EU’s trade strategy consists in engaging more with high-growth economies. I think that an agreement of this nature could therefore contribute to improving access to new markets for European businesses. We should not forget that, as an economic and trading entity, Taiwan belongs to 31 international organisations, including the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Asia Development Bank and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). We should also bear in mind that we have had a visa exemption policy for Taiwanese nationals in place since January 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The One China policy is one thing, but the EU needs further creative solutions in order to strengthen its trade partnership, for the benefit of its citizens and businesses.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as chairman of the EP-Taiwan Friendship Group in this Parliament, I strongly believe that the EU should pursue a free-trade type agreement with Taiwan, which will probably be called something like ‘trade enhancement measures’. Such an agreement is in the long-term interests of both sides, and the cake grows bigger for both as synergies and opportunities for joint ventures and free flow of investments can carry on in both directions. I recently had the pleasure of trying some of their excellent single malt whisky, so Scotland beware! Competition is on its way!</p>
      <p sl="en">Taiwan is a democracy with a vibrant free market and a largely export-driven economy. Therefore I urge the Commission not to place Taiwan in some sort of queue for negotiating an agreement. Already we know how successful the visa-free agreement has been – it should have been in place for some months now. If other countries already discussing a free-trade deal with the EU are falling behind, Taiwan should not be penalised as a result. As and when Taiwan is ready to negotiate, the EU should respond positively and judge this country solely on its economic merits, without taking into consideration what is going on in other ASEAN countries or any possible political objections from China.</p>
      <p sl="en">The economic imperative is strong, but so too is the political imperative. Although Taiwan has made great progress in recent years towards stronger economic ties with the mainland by negotiating a successful, albeit controversial, Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with the PRC, Taiwan does not want to become over-dependent on one economic partner. The EU can therefore help to ensure Taiwan’s long-term economic prosperity by helping Taiwan to diversify its global economic perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would specifically like to ask the Commissioner: What timetable does the Commission foresee for negotiations with Taiwan? Given the unusual status of Taiwan in terms of EU legal recognition, under what legal basis and what country name will the negotiations take place? And which sectors in Taiwan and the European Union will, in the opinion of the Commission, benefit most from a possible FTA?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me to present the Commission’s reply to this question on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Karel De Gucht.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should first like to thank Parliament for having asked this question, as it gives us the opportunity to address the subject of our trade relations with Taiwan. To place these relations in context, it is worth mentioning that Taiwan is our fifteenth largest trade partner, with a trade balance in its favour, whilst the European Union is Taiwan’s main foreign investor. We certainly want to strengthen and develop this relationship. As you know, the Commission Communication of 10 November 2010 on Trade, Growth and World Affairs, which sets out the Commission’s vision for the future of our trade policy, stresses the need to strengthen our relationships, primarily with strategic partners such as the United States, Russia and Japan, and others in the same category.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The communication also recognises the importance of the emerging economies, especially those in Asia. It does not mention Taiwan as a specific priority, but the communication in itself already provides a useful framework for relations with these economies. Although we do not have a formal agreement with Taiwan, we have a trade dialogue that works well and also provides a basis for addressing the future of our relationship.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards Taiwan’s trade relations with the rest of the world in general, the most recent event is the negotiation of a framework economic cooperation agreement with China, which we view as a major step forward. Indeed, good relations between China and Taiwan are crucial both from a practical point of view and from the point of view of our One China policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This agreement is not a free trade agreement as such, but a framework agreement that will be added to in certain areas. I think it is still too soon to know what opportunities this framework agreement will generate for European industry, but we should bear in mind that the furthering of trade ties between Taiwan and China will create new opportunities for our businesses in the region, and not act as an obstacle. In any case, we are following this development very closely.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards a free trade agreement between the EU and Taiwan, it is important to take Taiwan’s unique situation into consideration, especially in terms of its relationship with China. One of the arguments that Taiwan puts forward is that an agreement of this kind would create new opportunities for European businesses, not only in Taiwan but in mainland China also. The sizeable volume of Taiwan’s investments in China illustrates the extent of its relationship with China, whilst the European Union is also one of China’s major investors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should therefore view the strengthening of ties between Taiwan and China as a positive factor in the wider context of our economic links with the region as a whole, including China. From this point of view, it is important to avoid a false start that might jeopardise the development of good relations between China and Taiwan, or that might threaten our own relations with China and Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At this stage, the Commission feels it is not appropriate to begin a negotiation process for a free trade agreement with Taiwan, for the reasons I have just mentioned. As for other negotiations, there are certainly other areas that we could look into, to see if they might constitute building blocks for developing and strengthening our relations. The process to analyse these areas is currently under way. We will be having consultations in Taipei on 25 October, on which we are ready to feed back to the Committee on International Trade. We will look into what action is needed in order to follow up on whatever information we obtain during these talks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today is the first time for many years that we are discussing trade relations between Europe and Taiwan in the European Parliament. At least, I cannot remember having had such a debate since I was elected in 2004. That demonstrates how important it is, in view of the considerable importance of Taiwan for trade relations and for the economy in Europe, that we finally debate this matter here.</p>
      <p sl="de">The core issue is: what can the European Union do in order to improve trade relations and to enhance a mutual investment climate? We have put specific questions to the Commission. I certainly understand that Commissioner Cioloş cannot go into all of the questions in detail, but he did at least read out Mr De Gucht’s script. I have to say that I am rather disappointed. We are asking specific questions, and for one specific question we have received a specific response, namely to the question regarding a free trade agreement – not in the foreseeable future. However, to the other questions we have received the reply: the weather is nice here in Strasbourg and maybe in Brussels, too, and certainly in Taiwan – but I have not heard any real concept for how the trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan can be improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would be very grateful if the Commission could tell us more about this, as our group held a hearing on precisely this subject a few weeks ago and I got the impression that there are indeed ways to go about improving economic relations and the investment climate, even without a free trade agreement. I would be very grateful if the Commission would address some of the suggestions made there.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Andrikienė, Mr Šťastný and Mr Kazak, who were involved in initiating this hearing and who took part in it. I would really be very grateful if the Commission would not bury the subject of trade relations with Taiwan somewhere in a drawer, but instead if we could hear of a few more initiatives in this area in the next few years.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one can deny the importance of closer trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan. Yet, surely they must be aware of the well-known and delicate question, which the Commissioner also mentioned, of institutional relations between the countries officially known as the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China, with whom the European Union and all the Member States maintain steady diplomatic relations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore there is no doubt that the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in 2010 between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China will help to overcome the consequences of the territorial and political separation of ‘One China’ and will facilitate better trade discipline between the European Union and Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="it">Trade relations between us and the fourteenth largest global trade partner, the European Union’s seventh largest trade partner, can only improve, even though they require new regulations to eliminate the current barriers, in particular non-tariff and linguistic barriers, of a market that is still locked in the multilateral framework of the World Trade Organisation, which Taiwan has been a member of since 2002.</p>
      <p sl="it">As I have already mentioned, however, the principle difficulties concern relations with the People’s Republic of China. While we must address the issue of maintaining a dialogue with all parties, yet politically recognise a ‘One China’, we must ensure that the two Chinas do not turn the current triangular trade into veritable triangulation which could put the European Union at a trade disadvantage, as has already happened with other East Asian trade partners such as Korea.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree to a large extent with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). There is a degree of hypocrisy and also one of hesitation in what the Commissioner told us.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the 2010 communication, a paradox emerged in that the word Taiwan can neither be written nor spoken. Yet, it is a small China; very democratic and extremely vital both from a trade point of view and in terms of technological innovation. There is a very real principle which we must adhere to, especially in our trade undertakings. Taiwan exists and it exists de facto as a Sovereign State; Taiwan is a full member of the World Trade Organisation; we have excellent trade links with Taiwan and it is negotiating or will negotiate free trade agreements with several third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Something else is also true, which is that China, the People’s Republic of China, always responds with much irritation to our contact with Taiwan, nevertheless we do get the impression that it would be able to adapt with a certain level of pragmatism to a next step. Therefore we return to the original question, which we have still not had a compelling response to: is a free trade agreement possible with Taiwan, even at a lower or sectoral level? I think that this Parliament would be ready to support the Commission in such an undertaking.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should first make it crystal clear that the United Kingdom would be much better off if we, as a nation state, were able to negotiate our own trade agreements and thereby have trade arrangements in place that can conform, first and foremost, to the needs of our country.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Taiwan, UK representatives should do what we can to make certain that any proposed trade agreements with Taiwan – which is a democracy and a vibrant one –are not handicapped and hobbled by an extraneous political agenda placed on them by the Commission or, for that matter, by Parliament. We from Britain of course want to retain friendship with China – indeed Britain recognised China as far back as 1949 – but we should not, and must not, neglect future trade agreements with Taiwan.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is stating the obvious to say that the potential of the trade relations between the European Union and Taiwan is underexploited. The Taiwanese economy is continuing to do amazingly well and has been able to cope with the financial crisis well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am, of course, also disappointed by the Commission’s particularly vague statement in this House. If we wish to hold a debate about our trade relations with Taiwan, with the aim of reinforcing those relations, then it is necessary to first define and strengthen our political relations with Taiwan. We must recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state, as a democratic country that has not always had things easy in trying to keep that democracy in tact under the threat posed by the Communist Chinese mainland.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is thus very important that the European Union should make it clear that the threats relating to the commencement of diplomatic relations with Taiwan are unacceptable and anachronistic. As a first step, the European Union and the Member States must support Taiwan in its application for membership of all kinds of international organisations – I am thinking, first of all, of its membership of the World Health Organisation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like many speakers, I too am a little bit disappointed at the tone of the Commissioner’s response to this very important topic. Not having been here in the last parliamentary term, I am amazed at what Mr Caspary said about this being the first time we are discussing Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="en">When you consider that Taiwan is our fourteenth-largest trading partner and that we discuss so many topics here over the year, yet we never got around in the last seven or eight years to discuss EU and Taiwan trade, it is a welcome development that we are discussing it now.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I think the message has to go out loud and clear that we want a little more action, a little more pluck, from the Commission than what we have seen and certainly from what we have heard this evening. I get the impression that there is reluctance, that China might not be happy with us if we are engaging too much with Taiwan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, as the Earl said, we can have a good relationship with China, we want to have a good relationship with China, but that must not in any way impede us from having a good relationship with Taiwan and developing trade links with Taiwan. We have much to gain. They have much to gain. As was pointed out, the balance favours them at the moment and certainly, by having a trade agreement with them, we can redress that balance and ensure that both economies can develop.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said, I would like a little more pluck, a little more adventure and a little more courage. We have nothing to be afraid of. We have a lot to gain. So has Taiwan and probably, ultimately, China as well.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Taiwan’s efforts to improve relations in the straits with mainland China, through a series of practical arrangements culminating in the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, have replaced the fear of tension and conflict with the hope for peace and understanding.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must recognise that the questions pertaining to Taiwan are also the interests of China and it must pursue a policy based on the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, as stated by US Vice-President Joe Biden on 18 August 2001 and as is usually applied to Hong Kong today. I am resolutely opposed towards any unilateral measure that changes the State of Taiwan and that could cause tensions to flair across the straits, and so I ask the Commission to respect the territorial sovereignty of China, just as I ask China and Taiwan to build mutual trust and respect for each other.</p>
      <p sl="it">We live in a global world and the affairs of the East and the West are also our affairs, yet we must always respect the history of their peoples.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the European Union is Taiwan’s fifth largest trading partner, whereas for the Union, this Asian island ranks fourteenth among its trading partners.</p>
      <p sl="es">Trade between the two parties has increased by 800% in the last decades, with the annual trade volume currently standing at EUR 27.5 billion.</p>
      <p sl="es">Last year alone, trade between the Union and Taiwan grew by 39%. This growth has been boosted by measures such as visa exemption, introduced via the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. In spite of this and the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy stresses that the Union needs to step up its trade links with growing and emerging markets, our relations with Taiwan have not reached their full development as far as trade is concerned.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore necessary to bring in new measures to remove the obstacles – including tariffs, trade prohibitions, taxes and duties on luxury products – which currently prevent us from unlocking the full potential of trade with Taiwan. This would be a decisive step towards a dynamic, ambitious free trade agreement, which I support. A free trade agreement is necessary and it will benefit the parties involved. Good trade dialogue is not enough, Commissioner. We need to go much further.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, no one has the right to veto our relations.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Taiwan – as we know – is clearly seeking economic agreements with the United States and the European Union in order to be able to take up a key role in the predicted and expected growth of East Asia.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, it is of course important for us to bear a few things in mind. From computers to software to solar technology, innovations in the future-oriented sectors are largely taking place in Asia. It would be a dangerous development if only marketing, distribution and logistics were to remain in Europe in the long term. Competition from the East can all too easily degenerate into an industrial war if, for example, on account of generous loans, Chinese solar technology producers can toss their products onto the market at dumping prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">Electronics giants from Taiwan and South Korea may well quickly follow suit, and, in view of the massive distortions of competition, we will indeed have to take seriously the cry for help in this regard from European producers. Therefore, the EU will have to demonstrate a great deal of care and, no doubt, also farsightedness in respect of a trade agreement with Taiwan.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the growth of Asian markets shows that the EU should be paying much more attention to its trade policy in this area. EU trade with Taiwan has grown more than eightfold over the past two decades, and the EU is now one of Taiwan’s largest trading partners. However, it is still far from fulfilling the potential that actually exists here.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU should surely devote more attention to relations with Taiwan, particularly in a situation where its relations with China have improved. The EU has opportunities to increase both investment and trade with Taiwan. This potential should be exploited and barriers to trade and investment should at the same time be gradually removed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU must enter into negotiations with Taiwan over comprehensive economic cooperation as soon as possible, and begin considering a ‘second generation’ free trade agreement, similar to the one we recently signed with South Korea.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Taiwan is a world player – that much is beyond dispute. It is the 21st biggest economy in the world. Taipei has strong relations with China and with the United States and is an important partner for the European Union. Unfortunately – and I have also been personally able to observe this on the ground – the EU does not make the best use of the opportunities of the Taiwanese market, despite the fact that the island is the ideal springboard for European businesses looking to enter the Chinese market.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fact is that intellectual property is much better protected in Taiwan than on the mainland. What is more, Taiwan is the European Union’s most important industrial partner. In brief, the upgrading of our relations through a free trade agreement or trade facilitation is highly desirable. I hope that the Commission also knows how to get through to the Member States in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We must not allow ourselves to guided by the fear of a possible political price that China may demand.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, over the last year, China and Taiwan have been drawing ever closer together, and finally there are scheduled flights between Taiwan and the mainland – unthinkable a few years ago – and tourism and student exchanges between the two are promoted. The volume of trade between the two countries is increasing rapidly, and these developments, it seems to me, are barely given any consideration by the EU. We are neglecting trade relations with Taiwan. The state is liberal in any case, the customs duty is low and there are barely any non-tariff barriers to trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we have a free trade agreement with Korea. That causes distortions of competition, because Taiwan and Korea operate in the same areas of business. It would therefore be beneficial for us to also recognise Taiwan as the important trading partner it is. Anyone who conducts trade with Taiwan need not expect or fear a boycott from Beijing. Thus, the EU needs to face up to these new developments and take the appropriate action.</p>

The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement that has been concluded between the Republic of China and the People’s Republic of China is a clear indication of rapprochement between the two parties which should also be reflected in the relations of Taiwan with the European Union. In any case the EU should not miss out on enhancing trade relations with Taiwan, which has indeed become a rapidly growing market, but not at the expense of the environment or the socio-economic rights of the labour force. The EU ought to demonstrate readiness to engage in negotiations on furthering trade and investment with Taiwan. In order to secure the position of the EU in the international arena, its policies must be consistent and complementary. Therefore, it would only be natural to pursue mutually beneficial relations as a priority with countries that share with us a free market economy as well as the principles of democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">In June of this year I was one of the participants in the EU-Taiwan trade relations hearing. The conclusion at this hearing was unanimous: closer relations would clearly be beneficial to both sides. The only concern expressed by the Commission was about China’s reaction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without going deeper into the political debate, I must say the deeds of China speak loud. They themselves concluded the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with Taiwan in 2010. It is yet another sign that Communist China is moving forward step by step. They understand that engagement and not isolation is the solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">Other countries like Singapore and New Zealand are also moving forward with much more ambitious trade relations with Taiwan and the EU should do the same.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Carlo Fidanza, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Europe, the world’s No 1 tourist destination – a new political framework for tourism in Europe (2010/2206(INI)) - (A7-0265/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-115-000" speaker_id="96810" name="Carlo FIDANZA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Italy" birth_date="21-09-1976" birth_place="San Benedetto del Tronto" m_state="IT">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start first of all by thanking the Commission, the Council, the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs for the opinion of a further five committees who, in addition to the Committee on Transport and Tourism responsible, worked on this own-initiative report.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is the first own-initiative report since the Treaty of Lisbon introduced the European Union’s responsibility for tourism policy under Article 195. Tourism is naturally an area in which there is strong competition between countries and often within each individual country there is competition between regions and areas. Therefore, what sense does trying to work together on a political framework for tourism in Europe make?</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that it makes a lot of sense, because we are faced with a different world to that of 20 years ago; a multipolar world in which new countries are emerging, appearing and offering Europe a large number of new potential tourists who we must engage with in order to secure Europe’s place as the world’s number one tourist destination. It makes sense because tourism is one of the sectors which has withstood the global crisis most effectively, thus we must invest heavily to sustain the competitiveness of our tourism businesses and to maintain the visibility of our tourist destinations.</p>
      <p sl="it">With this report we propose to advance the 21 actions which the European Commission and Vice-President Tajani identified in the June 2010 communication and to identify which of these 21 actions are the priorities to deal with immediately within a fixed timeframe.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, the subject of measures for supporting competitiveness and access to credit for tourism businesses; the subject of training and professional qualifications with the need to invest heavily in new professionals with managerial aspirations to attract these new waves of tourism; the basic theme of innovation and of information and communication technologies to improve the prominence and presence of our businesses and of our destinations on online marketplaces.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must find new means by which to overcome a rigid seasonality, which constricts the tourist season and limits the opportunity for growth in our businesses. We must continue to invest in the actions that have yielded good results so far, I refer specifically to Calypso. We must work on environmental sustainability and on the accessibility of tourist facilities and destinations, so that the several million possible and potential tourists with reduced mobility can be fully entitled tourists.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must promote the cultural routes, as has been done by the Council of Europe in recent years, and introduce new ones. We must invest in international events, as they can be used to attract tourists coming from outside the European Union. We must invest in quality, emphasising quality as a key tenet of the European tourism offering.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must not hide from the fact that there is a problem regarding the funding of the tourism policy. Until now there was no jurisdiction and thus there were no notable budget lines to be able to advance these projects, moreover many resources were slightly hidden inside the Structural Funds. Therefore we must, on one hand, make the existing resources more visible and, on the other hand, work closely with the Commission on specific budget headings so that we are able to progress the 21 actions and all the ambitious projects that we have.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the future that we have outlined with this report, which must not be a cat set among the pigeons, but the first step of an endeavour to which I believe the European Parliament could still give much more.</p>

    <intervention id="1-116-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Vice-president of the Commission. − Mr President, honourable Members, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank Mr Fidanza, and all the MEPs who have worked with him, for this own-initiative report, which demonstrates once again just how in tune the European Commission and the European Parliament are with one another on an issue that really is becoming extraordinarily important at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tourism is an economic sector that is vital for growth and for the competitiveness of the EU as a whole and I am delighted that the document that we are discussing highlights how closely growth is linked to tourism and to the contribution that this sector, which by now must constitute a fully paid-up sector of industry and European entrepreneurship, can make whether in relation to GDP, employment or social inclusion.</p>
      <p sl="it">The data available to us, including data coming in after the end of the summer, are reassuring. True, there was a drop in 2010 but tourist numbers have remained substantially unchanged in many countries over the summer of this year and there has even been some improvement in the situation. Our work has been aimed principally at the younger generation, given that tourism is one of the sectors in the world of business that provides most employment to young people.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am delighted that I can share the views expressed in the report when it proposes new initiatives and specific actions of great interest, which I will certainly take into consideration when implementing the 21 actions of the action plan, which aim to develop a truly coherent EU policy for high-quality, modern tourism that is both competitive and sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="it">Thanks to these actions, our aim as regards competitiveness is to favour synergies between recent innovative technologies and tourism, as Mr Fidanza has highlighted, and to make participation by businesses that are active in tourism possible, in particular SMEs and their transition to digital. We intend to improve the link between supply and demand in the market for workers in the tourist industry, devising a way of mapping qualifications and professional skills.</p>
      <p sl="it">We intend to guarantee a consistent quality of European tourism products and to intensify efforts aimed at promoting Europe as a collection of sustainable and high-quality destinations and, as the rapporteur indicated in the course of his speech, in future in the sphere of social tourism we must ensure Calypso preparatory action, through the creation of a web-based platform of supply and demand, as a mechanism for facilitating exchanges of tourists between countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced that, as a result of increased attention from interested parties and Member State involvement, exchanges of tourists between countries and cofinanced web projects from Calypso will achieve very positive results.</p>
      <p sl="it">As regards sustainability, this is closely connected to competitiveness in this highly important sector, because the quality of tourist destinations is strongly influenced by the natural and cultural environment and by their integration in the local community. Consequently, our efforts are intended also to guarantee sustainable development for tourism. To this end, I intend to propose a European charter for responsible tourism aimed at sanctioning at a European level the commitment of public administrations, tourism businesses and all those who are interested in promoting tourist activities in Europe that meet a series of principles of sustainability and responsibility at a social, economic, and, I stress, environmental level and also at a cultural level.</p>
      <p sl="it">I was in Madrid, last week, for the conclusion of the first ethical tourism day and in the course of my speech I stressed the commitment to combating exploitation of women and children but also to protecting the environment, hence tourism is also part of our strategy in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also intend to focus ever more closely on increasing the visibility of Europe and its tourist destinations. We are ready to take part in the European Tourism Forum on 6 October in Krakow, which will focus on joint, transnational promotion in third country markets and I would like to stress that the European Commission has been the promoter of an initiative, of a pilot project, to increase tourist numbers from Latin American countries during the low season.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have signed an agreement with Chile, Argentina and Brazil, an agreement to which certain EU countries have signed up, notably Spain, France, Italy, Portugal and Poland and also Romania which, only the other day when I visited Bucharest, decided to sign up to take part in this project involving the biggest European airlines and all the tour operators.</p>
      <p sl="it">In short, an opportunity to look at ever-increasing tourist numbers from Latin America during the low season. This is a signal that we want to give to all businesses operating in the tourist sector. And I am delighted once again with the European Parliament and with its proposal when it comes to funding. The success of the joint venture and the future of the European tourism sector will obviously depend in ample measure on the possibility of obtaining adequate political support and financial backing for European tourism policy within the current financial framework and also beyond 2014.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wish to reassure those who may have concerns about competences. I intend to rely upon the legal basis of the treaty, I do not intend to violate the principle of subsidiarity and the European Commission does not intend to take the place of or to usurp regional competences nor the competences of individual Member States in matters of tourism and this too I think is in line with the views of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our intention is only to increase tourist numbers within the EU. As I was able to respond to Mr Fidanza during Question Time in the last plenary, I am working to achieve the objective of increased funding in the next financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">As you well know, in fact, as part of the Commission’s proposal we have decided to create a fund to support the competitiveness of SMEs which will have EUR 2.4 billion at their disposal. Obviously, I am counting on including tourism among the activities to support competitiveness, just as I am counting on having the support of Parliament once again, once discussions commence at the level of the two co-legislators.</p>
      <p sl="it">I thank you once again for your attention and I assure Parliament once again of my commitment to ensuring that, at this delicate time, tourism can be the instigator of growth and above all, a tool for the protection of the environment and for the creation of new jobs, above all for younger workers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as the Commissioner pointed out, the Lisbon Treaty now gives us a legal basis and the confidence to do something on tourism at a Europe-wide level, which was not there before. Certainly it is an opportunity we are right to grasp.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe is the number one tourist destination in the world. It contributes 12% of employment to the European Union and 10% to GDP and, as the Commissioner pointed out, there is a great opportunity to grow that even further. Europe is rich in all sorts of attractions for tourists and this can be developed.</p>
      <p sl="en">From the cultural point of view, we are very pleased that a number of initiatives are already very successful, such as the European Cities of Culture, the European Cultural Roots Programme – St James’ Way being the shining example – the European Heritage Label and, in recent times, the European Cities of Sport.</p>
      <p sl="en">I particularly want to highlight the importance of sport because, both from a participative and also from a spectator’s point of view, it has huge potential. Last weekend the Solheim Cup, which is the female version of the Ryder Cup, was held in my own country, where Europe had an outstanding win. I think opportunities to grow sport, particularly water sports, can be developed right across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we have a great opportunity; there are projects and targets. Let us go at it because it can do a great deal for the economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the challenge of the coming years is to ensure that Europe, as has been said, maintains its position as the world’s number one tourist destination and, at the same time, is able to enhance its entire territorial heritage, both in terms of environmental protection and competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="it">The challenge is a difficult one and not to be taken lightly, having regard not only to the opportunities but also to the aggressiveness of other countries in this sector, of other continents from China to India and Brazil. Against this backdrop, as Commissioner Tajani mentioned, and as noted also in the opinion that we approved on the Committee on Regional Development, having a strong, general, EU-wide strategy on tourism with an enhanced role for the regions and territories becomes fundamental. Accordingly, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, it is essential that regions and local authorities are fully involved from the outset.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, I believe that the development of integrated tourist networks and projects should be encouraged through the creation of partnerships for the exchange of best practice. I think that the proposal to identify a ‘Europe brand’ that is capable of defining a high quality of tourist product is also good. Obviously, it will be up to the Commission to define better the priorities, above all from a financial point of view, to guarantee that Europe retains its number one position in future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I was the rapporteur for the opinion expressed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this subject. I think it is important that the final report adopted our references to rural tourism and agritourism.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Rural tourism is an asset to Europe and must be capitalised on. This sector plays a vital role in keeping some rural areas alive, in increasing revenues in these areas and in creating jobs. Support for investments in rural tourism must continue to be eligible for sufficient funding as part of the future common agricultural policy, coming under the second pillar where sufficient funding must also be maintained for the rural infrastructure and investments which can make European villages more easily accessible and attractive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I will conclude by also stressing the importance of the call made to the Commission to promote ecotourism.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to warmly congratulate Carlo Fidanza on this first-rate report on a new political framework for European tourism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Tourism is a huge and very important industry in Europe, linking in with economic, cultural and environmental factors, as well as transport considerations, of course.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report also provides an ideal springboard for cooperation between EU institutions, Member States and parties involved in the tourism industry on the ground. Our aim must be to give a high value-added European dimension to national and regional initiatives, through concrete actions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this report, we voice our support for promoting a more sustainable, responsible and competitive tourism industry. I believe that sustainability and responsibility in tourism are not restricted to the environmental issues, but also have an important social aspect. Tourist sector businesses are obliged to adopt a social responsibility policy, by creating high quality jobs for qualified employees, whilst enabling and improving mobility for employees in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I would also like to draw attention to the pioneering work done by the Luxembourg-based European Institute of Cultural Routes, as well as the projects run under the INTERREG programme. I should mention in particular the many initiatives that have been launched in the region, for example in Luxembourg, Belgium and Germany: these can act as models and we ought to do even more to promote them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that this important work will continue to receive support from the Commission and from the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, the tourism industry in Europe is in decline and needs new momentum. It faces challenges which require specific, new answers and needs to make efforts to adjust. In this unprecedented economic crisis in Europe, tourism is the best economic activity for creating new jobs, securing income for local communities and hence boosting regional development, and promoting the competitiveness of a huge range of undertakings.</p>
      <p sl="el">If we are to make the best possible use of this potential, we need measures and policies to coordinate, harmonise and improve the quality of the European tourism product. Thus, players in the European tourism industry need to join forces and work on a standard policy framework which takes account of the Union’s new priorities. Developing and promoting diversified forms of tourism may be the only effective response to the distortions, problems and deterioration to which the current model of undifferentiated mass tourism is leading.</p>
      <p sl="el">Support for actions, with the necessary funding, to promote diversified tourism in the Union, addressing seasonal fluctuations in tourist activity, utilising information and communication technologies, using innovation to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, mitigating the accessibility problems of island and mountain areas, taking social tourism – tourism for all – initiatives, introducing the principles of interregionality and complementarity, improving the standard of services provided, considering the feasibility of a charter of tourists’ rights and responsibilities and simplifying tourist visa procedures, especially for the BRIC group of countries, are just some of the issues addressed in this report.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Parliament report sets out an ambitious framework to make European tourism a more competitive, modern, viable and responsible industry. It also seeks to restore a healthy relationship between tourist development and the environment. Tapping the diversity, multifacetedness and multiculturalism of the European tourism product will offer maximum growth for any form of thematic tourism and, without doubt, will lend added European value to the Member States’ tourism policies. We call on the European Commission to submit an integrated strategy by the end of 2012 for implementing the actions proposed in this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I wish to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is an historic step in the institutional evolution of Europe following the Treaty of Lisbon that for the first time competences are assigned to Parliament and the Commission in relation to tourism, which is the third component of the economy and of employment in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">First of all, I would like to stress that the text that is being put to the House today sets out a comprehensive governance that stems from Europe 2020 strategy and develops a series of proposals to achieve growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive in every sense. Accordingly, it suggests specific programming instruments such as strategies for macro-regions, interregionality and joint and complementary planning.</p>
      <p sl="it">At times like these, when governance loses its bearings, we know what the negative effects are. Here, on the other hand, the dossier traces a very precise path. Out of these plans and instruments, I wish to call to mind the extraordinary plan to foster a progressive reduction in the seasonal nature of tourism, set out in paragraph 63 of the report.</p>
      <p sl="it">From the point of view of a European economy that, unfortunately, is losing a large share of industrial output, tourism can and must represent an important factor for overall growth, above all if the main public and private players can create an integrated approach between the different policies of the sector, the various financial instruments and build tourism into a real system that brings together the various economic sectors: agriculture, industry, craft, transport, services, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should mention that the text being voted upon contains numerous references to islands and remote areas which represent, as I was saying at the outset, a tangible way of achieving, through appropriate financial instruments, the criterion of inclusion sought by Europe 2020 strategy. Ladies and gentlemen, the tourism sector is also characterised by sustainable growth in environmental and social terms, which supports SMEs for which we have provided a business incubator tool, for innovation by way of supplying knowledge tools that will enable them to achieve, and the tourist to obtain, better travel solutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Further, beyond the specific actions already put forward by the Commission I must give credit to Commissioner Tajani for the particular attention paid to SMEs and micro-enterprises, which must be singled out. In the report, they are regarded as guaranteeing innovation from the bottom up and they are expressly recognised as fulfilling the function of ensuring the quality, variety and authenticity of the different regions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, tourism is a springboard for the economy of many countries, in the rapporteur’s country as well as the Commissioner’s. I think that it could also be an opportunity for those poorer EU countries such as Poland, which is one of the five poorest Member States of the EU. I think this, too, needs to be seen in this context. I would like to thank the rapporteur for drafting a very good report. I would also like to stress that tourism represents an opportunity in times of crisis – as my predecessors have also said – because although tourism may decrease, it can also increase paradoxically in some areas, and it is certainly not dead and buried.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to point out some specific areas of tourism, or rather types of tourism that might represent an opportunity. Firstly, there is environmental tourism, or visiting those areas of Europe where nature has been preserved in its former state. For example, this is the case in the east of my country: nature reserves and special species of plants and animals which do not occur anywhere else. These parts of Europe are not well-known but are very important, and I think it would be worth considering an ecological, environmental form of tourism.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, sports tourism, which is statistically very significant, and which is becoming more and more important. More and more people are travelling to sports events and are getting to know new countries and new regions as a result. At this point I would like to invite you all to my country, Poland, for the European football championships next year. We will welcome everyone with traditional Polish hospitality.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, another issue is tourism on the fringes of the European Union. Many Europeans travel to the Maghreb Union Countries. We should also mention that other European breathing space, Eastern Europe, on the fringes of the EU, including countries such as Belarus, Ukraine and the eastern areas of Poland – this is a quite fascinating subject.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, agritourism. Tourism to build bridges between countries which are already in the EU and countries which will form part of the EU in the future. I am pleased, as Commissioner Tajani has said – and I would like to end on this note – that both Parliament and the Commission agree on this.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, tomorrow, 27 September, is World Tourism Day, as well as European Tourism Day. I think that that is excellent timing for the first report on tourism since the advent of the new powers under the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Other Members have already said that the European tourism sector generates a large number of jobs and represents an important engine for our economy, including for Flanders, the region that I represent here. I am thus pleased that this report contains proposals to further bolster the competitiveness of the tourism sector and that it pays particular attention to the specific role of SMEs in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As shadow rapporteur for my group I organised a colloquium in Parliament a few months ago where a number of good practices in tourism were presented. What came strongly to the fore as a result of that meeting was the idea that putting the ideas of quality, sustainability, participation and accessibility at the heart of the tourism sector could deliver a win-win situation for all the parties involved, and these principles also enjoy a prominent place in this report.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I still believe, however, that the Commission communication has too few priorities. It therefore seems to me to be crucial that the Commission should take Parliament’s call for a more integrated approach to heart and bring forward an integrated strategy next year which is more specifically focused on the tangible added value that Europe can offer in respect of the policy that is already being pursued by Europe’s regions and the Member States. If we want to make this a reality on the ground, this coordination of content must be reflected in the financial resources for tourism in the new multiannual financial framework. The report contained a number of very specific suggestions in this regard – I would also point to crisis management, as, in emergencies, coordination and identical operation in relation to information in all Member States are crucial.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, we come to the labels. I think that we need to avoid a further proliferation of brands and that the number of brands needs to be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I am really pleased that the report also asks the Commission to look into the feasibility of a Charter of tourists’ rights and responsibilities comprising principles such as accessibility, provision of information, transparent pricing and compensation. Mr President, I will conclude by offering my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, and all my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the excellent collaboration that we enjoyed.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, whether we are discussing tourism or any other topic in this Chamber, we inevitably end up talking about competitiveness. How, though, can the Louvre’s competitiveness be compared with that of the Hermitage Museum? That of Venice with that of the Château de Versailles? That of the Côte d’Azur with that of the Beskidy Mountains?</p>
      <p sl="fr">It would be laughable were it not for the fact that, behind the quest for competitiveness at any price, there unfortunately lies an awful reality for tourism’s workforce, with very low wages, excessive exploitation and mass insecurity. Insecurity and excessive exploitation that will be made yet worse by the transposition of the former Bolkestein Directive into national law by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What the tourism industry and its workforce need is a substantial increase in the purchasing power of Europe’s entire active population, because, without an income worthy of the name, there can be no leisure activities. What the tourism workforce is expecting from Europe is increased protection to eradicate exploitation.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this new European policy framework, a European tourism policy, is a typical example of Europe trying to seize more power for itself, at the expense of the Member States. As far as the Dutch Party for Freedom is concerned, tourism policy is primarily the national responsibility of the Member States. Since when have the Member States not been able to conduct their own tourism policy?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Even more important is the fact that tourism is clearly not a cross-border problem where there would be a need for Europe to get involved. In Brussels, sadly, this is seen differently. In future, the tourism industry, too, will be expected to contribute to what is referred to as the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Furthermore, this report does not fail to take account of the tourism sector’s contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy and its absurd climate targets. Mr President, I will give a number of illustrations of the plans. Thus, for example, the feasibility of a ‘Europe brand’ for high quality tourism is to be studied. Needless to say, it will be the mandarins in Brussels who will define what such high quality tourism consists of, rather than the country in question or the tourists themselves. Tourism to so-called sustainable destinations is also to be promoted, while remote islands and outlying areas will soon be grabbing from Brussels’ big pot of subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe must not meddle in the tourism industry. This area should just be left to the Member States. They are perfectly positioned to ensure a varied and competitive offering for tourists.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Fidanza for his report, which not only champions competitive, innovative tourism, but also ethical, sustainable tourism.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank him for heeding our demands on the special needs of outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="es">I should also like to congratulate the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Tajani, for his willingness to make up for lost time in this sector. The Lisbon Treaty provided a much needed and much celebrated legal basis, but now it is time to secure the necessary funding.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am particularly pleased at the report’s acknowledgement that the superb lessons we drew from the Calypso social tourism programme must be put to work in order to unlock the sector’s seasonality. We need to stimulate tourism for all Europeans, whichever their social or financial situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreements with Latin America are also good news. I wish to express my support for your policies in this area, which will hopefully mean tourists from those countries will be granted visas and helped in other ways.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think specialisation is particularly useful in improving tourism quality: heritage tourism, health and spa tourism, gastronomic tourism, sports tourism, rural tourism, and even shopping tourism.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is also crucial, in my opinion, to make further progress in the area of accessibility for tourists with reduced mobility, improve tourists’ rights, and implement, in collaboration with management and labour, a strategy for excellence in training and employment conditions for all industry workers.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need good professionals because they are the cornerstone of Europe’s leadership in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, as I have already said, all this requires funding. You will definitely have our support from now on in the debate on financial perspectives. I therefore call on you, Mr Tajani, to be as ambitious as the tourist industry merits. We will support you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to respond directly to Ms Stassen, who is the only one so far to say that we do not actually need tourism in Europe. I believe that we do indeed need it, and, moreover, it will not undermine the competitiveness and autonomy of the individual Member States. It is indeed the case that Europe is currently the number one tourist destination in the world, and, naturally enough, we would like it to stay that way. We want it to stay that way with all the diversity that we have. The diversity that we have in Europe can be seen from the previous speeches. These alone have made it worthwhile to be part of this debate, because if anyone thinks that 10 days is sufficient in which to see Europe – thus, the Acropolis, the Tower of London, the Eiffel Tower and perhaps Neuschwanstein in Germany – he or she is mistaken. Europe offers much more and it has developed a great deal more in terms of tourism.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would now like to mention something in particular that we have in north Germany, where I come from. We have cycling tourism, we also have nature-oriented tourism, not only holidays on the farm, which certainly also awakens a real understanding of nature, but, for example, also tourism in very sensitive areas such as the Wadden Sea beside the North Sea. That is a globally unique area. There you can really see how, right next to main shipping routes, a very sensitive form of tourism can be developed that also awakens an understanding of the diversity of nature. This is something that we need more of.</p>
      <p sl="de">Something that has not had any, or very little, mention is the fact that we also have old mines and old industrial heritage sites, for example, that you can view and where you can learn a great deal about the history of Europe and the working environment. Thus, there is a very broad spectrum, and in that regard we ought to consider how we can bring this to the outside world and how we can maintain Europe as a very attractive tourist destination in future, too.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism generates about 10% of EU GDP and employs about 12 million workers. In addition to this, it should be noted that European countries are regularly amongst the most visited and most popular destinations. Europe has, however, continued to fail to take advantage of its enormous potential as a unified mark of quality and sustainable tourism for tourists from third countries. There is an increase in particular in travel from the BRIC countries to the European Union at the moment. Data published by Eurostat shows that, when comparing the first halves of 2009 and 2010, the number of visits from the Russian Federation increased by 18%, from China by 19% and from Brazil by as much as 46%. Of these countries, China has the greatest long-term potential. According to World Tourism Organization statistics from 2009, China, which has a total population of 1.3 billion, increased expenditure on outbound tourism by 21%. In order to take full advantage of this growing potential, we must provide a simpler visa policy for tourists, such as group tourist visas, and also support individual tourism. We must also gradually overcome the seasonal nature of tourism and introduce the Europe brand as a year-round destination that can offer natural, cultural and industrial heritage.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, places great emphasis on this approach, and I therefore fully support his report; I wish to congratulate him and all the shadow rapporteurs, and to thank them for the work that they have carried out.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I intend to support this report because I believe it epitomises several of the principles that should guide the process of European integration.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report is based on the acknowledgment that our different traditions, customs and even languages are an expression of our diversity, but also an economic asset that becomes fully visible in the tourist industry.</p>
      <p sl="es">Accordingly, the report makes the case for embracing diversity using a bottom-up approach, and strengthening it through training, innovation and new technologies, with the ultimate aim of building a common European brand of quality tourism. Tourism that embodies the three key notions of the 2020 strategy: smart, sustainable, inclusive development.</p>
      <p sl="es">One expression of these principles is the Basque Culinary Centre that opens this week in San Sebastián. The University of Mondragón and Basque chefs have opened, with the support of public institutions, the first School of Gastronomic Science, and a food and gastronomy research and innovation centre: quality and training in line with the values that should underpin the European tourism brand.</p>

We have received numerous proposals for how, together, we can keep tourism competitive throughout Europe. An important part of this is the development of quality tourism. We ought to set a few priorities here in order to develop this quality tourism.</p>
      <p sl="de">The first thing we need to do is to invest more than we have done up to now in the training of the people working in this industry. We need to break down barriers so that we open up new markets, for example by means of an easier process for issuing tourist visas. We must gradually harmonise the hotel classification systems. Above all, however, we also need to ensure that school holidays are better coordinated in order to avoid traffic jams and to be able to fully utilise the businesses better.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, we ought to try, out of the numerous programmes that are available to us, to prioritise an investment programme to promote tourism. Overall …</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank you very much for allowing me to speak in this important debate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I feel heartened that our Parliament has dealt with tourism comprehensively, just as the European Commission has been doing for some time. In my country, Poland, the tourism sector is also becoming more and more important both socially and economically. It seems to me that it is particularly important to promote increasingly diversified offers throughout the EU and also to encourage people in the EU to extend the tourist season, creating the financial and legal conditions for them to do so. We should also compete for and strive to encourage more tourists from outside the EU more actively than we have been doing. In my opinion, one of the more important issues is to overcome the visa barrier. This is where the most dynamic changes in the EU should take place.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, tourism, as we know, can also destroy tourism. Therefore, we also need to combine economy and the environment when it comes to tourism. We know that cycling tourism has been growing by more than 20% per year for the last two decades and that, above all, cycling tourists spend more money than motoring tourists, which, in particular, supports the local economy. I very much welcome Commissioner Tajani’s Cultural Routes programme and I would ask you also to include the Iron Curtain Trail in these routes, as the culture relating to the division of Europe is depicted wonderfully along this 9 000 kilometre cycleway stretching from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea through 20 countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also need to pay attention to the funding. Our analyses show that 60% of the transport funding goes into the roads, only 20% goes into the railways and 0.7% into the cycling infrastructure. Of course, we need this too and we can support it. We therefore say: we want at least 15% of the budget for cycle tourism and for walking. Then we will also be able to provide the basis for an ecotourism that serves both the economy and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, despite the fact that tourism is an important and stable source of revenue for EU countries, it is right to discuss opportunities for boosting its potential.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, one effective and available measure we might quickly deploy to boost revenue in tourism, is a more flexible EU visa policy. Experience from the time when my own country did not apply visa restrictions on its Eastern neighbours showed us that the inhabitants of Ukraine, Russia and also other countries from this region were very interested in learning about life in advanced European countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Following the introduction of the Schengen border and the introduction of mandatory visas for visitors from the east, our tourism revenues fell very sharply. I therefore firmly believe that greater openness and a more flexible EU visa policy towards countries with dynamic economic growth would relatively quickly bring in significant numbers of new customers for European companies operating in the field of tourism.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, tourism needs a clear and coordinated European approach that is attentive to the possibilities and challenges the various forms of tourism offer us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The touristic diversity presented by the European Union is so rich that exponential growth of this sector and of the competitiveness of the European Union in general is possible. Investment in this key sector, which represents 10% of gross domestic product and 12% of employment in the European Union, will make it possible not only to create European added value, but also to cope with the economic crisis now facing us.I come from an outermost region, Madeira, where tourism is the principal economic activity. Hence the creation of a special heading for this sector in the financial framework for 2014-2020 is indispensable for cohesive and sustainable growth in the tourism industry, which is essentially made up of small and medium-sized enterprises. The development of a sustainable, diversified and genuinely European policy for tourism needs a tangible strategic plan, with a calendar and well-defined actions and financing that are capable of enhancing the visibility and quality of the tourism sector in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am a municipal councillor in a small village in central Spain. While it is true that the tourist industry is an opportunity for the entire European Union, it is much more markedly so for rural areas like ours, for three reasons: firstly because it diversifies the economy, bringing a new opportunity for women and young people, and is also a policy that can prevent depopulation in our rural areas; secondly because these activities also fully complement the activities of the primary sector, and even strengthen them in the case of agritourism; and thirdly because, unlike in the coastal sector, seasonality is not as high, which can also mean new, longer-lasting, better-quality jobs.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore like to stress that this report should not make the mistake of setting a European strategy based, once again, on the coastal or urban sector. Rural areas should be a priority, particularly in terms of competitiveness, investment, training, innovation, the adoption of excellence as its standard, consistency in quality criteria, and greater visibility. Furthermore, rural tourism should be taken into account across each and every one of the Commission’s actions.</p>

      <p sl="el">I asked for the floor in order to raise the issue of the European Heritage Label. It is very important, in that it supports the competitiveness of European tourism, but if this is to happen, sites which receive the European Heritage Label must remain open all year round and we must encourage the Member States to ensure that they do. I would go one step further and punish heritage sites which are not accessible every day of the year by withdrawing their label.</p>

      <p sl="ro">An effective European tourism policy needs not only a strategy and action plan, but also sufficient funds. Revitalising tourism, which is an integral part of European industrial policy, is a strategic employment objective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In recognition of the close link between tourism and transport, we call on the Commission and Member States to modernise the national, regional and cross-border infrastructure for the various modes of transport. We support the promotion of integrated electronic ticket sales systems for the various means of transport and we call for a charter of tourists’ rights and responsibilities comprising principles relating to accessibility, provision of information, transparent pricing and compensation.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the report proposes drawing up a charter of tourists’ rights and responsibilities including, among other things, principles relating to accessibility and the provision of transparent pricing and compensation information. Tourists’ rights must be protected, and drawing up a charter to include all the currently existing European consumer rights legislation is a first step towards this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As I see it, introducing a standard EU-level contract between the tourist and operator would be the next logical step towards harmonising and protecting European tourists’ rights. The need to harmonise the classification of hotels by identifying minimum common standards is also of paramount importance. This harmonisation process, along with other factors, provides the basis for safeguarding tourists’ rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Fidanza for the excellent work he has done. His report certainly contains excellent proposals and I am sure that the Commission will take them into serious consideration.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am of the view that we should have a twin and integrated approach. On the one hand, we should be improving the image of European tourism in the eyes of the world through the promotion of our common heritage and on the other sustaining and enhancing as much as possible the individual nature of each Member State. An example for everyone would be the beaches of Italy, which are truly one of a kind and inimitable.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I am in favour of introducing a European brand so long as national characteristics are promoted at the same time. Moving on to aspects of the internal market, I am very glad to note that the proposal to harmonise the accommodation classification system, which would surely enable quality standards to be raised and reinforcement of consumer protection, has been welcomed. Furthermore, the idea of creating a white list of tour operators, which was tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection but which, sadly, was not adopted in the report, should not, in my opinion, be rejected and I hope that in future it can be reconsidered.</p>

    <intervention id="1-143-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for again emphasising the number of MEPs who wished to take part in this debate. It shows that tourism policy is a priority policy for us. It is part of the policy for entrepreneurship and I am pleased that many of you stressed the importance of, and the support that we should give to, the small and medium-sized enterprises and the micro-enterprises operating in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">My main commitment, as you know, is to support the business world, and, I repeat, as I said in my first speech, as far as I am concerned, the tourism sector is a fully fledged part of the business and industry sector. Several remarks made during the debate are entirely in line with the Commission’s position, and, I repeat, we are in perfect agreement and this only serves to consolidate a joint action by the European Commission and the European Parliament. No one could be happier about this than me, having spent 15 years as a Member of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Together we shall be able to put in place a policy to drive tourism policy and its coordinated development which, I repeat, does not violate the principles of subsidiarity: the competences of the regions and the Member States, I repeat, will remain as they are now. European policy and coordination and governance at European level only serve to provide added value. They certainly serve to develop and make the most of the internal market, but they also serve to attract more tourists from wealthier countries to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why I am making intensive efforts to attract Latin Americans. I am making efforts to attract visitors from Brazil, India, Russia and China. Clearly, as many speakers pointed out, visas are a key issue. The European Commission has acknowledged this, we are deeply committed and we have spoken about this in informal Council meetings with ministers for tourism: we do have a problem when it comes to security.</p>
      <p sl="it">My position is that without the slightest doubt, terrorists are not worried, they have no problem obtaining a visa. I think, however, that we need to work harder to try to solve the problem, or at least facilitate the issue of visas. I fully agree with the commitment regarding the low season so that hotels and all tourist facilities can stay open as long as possible, hence the pilot projects which we are launching, and, I repeat, the Latin American project is important as far as I am concerned.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also agree that we need to exploit all sectors in order to attract tourists, including the sports sector. It is no accident that the Commission’s document mentions the London Olympics as an event that we should capitalise on – likewise the Milan Expo – in short, everything that Europe has to offer must become a means of boosting tourist numbers.</p>
      <p sl="it">I fully support the strong action promoting green tourism. Tourism must also be a tool to make the best use of Europe’s environment and natural heritage, whether in coastal or mountainous regions, and as has already been stressed, the idea of developing cycling tourism is something which appeals to me, and is a sector which is continuing to gain ground.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other day, during an official visit to Bucharest, I talked at length with the Minister for Tourism who had launched a project to develop cycling tourism precisely in Romania’s capital city. I also support the idea that we need to give due importance to areas such as the Danube Delta, and also to countries which on the face of things are not top of the list when it comes to tourism policy. Every country of Europe has, however, an exceptional heritage to offer.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am delighted that countries such as Poland are making every effort – as did the Hungarian Presidency previously – to support a European tourism policy that certainly represents added value for the growth of our economy, including by taking part in the summit on 6 October. Therefore, I can only congratulate Mr Fidanza and all the Members: it is rare to see so many MEPs in this Chamber during a debate at this time of day, which means that this topic is of great interest.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would stress – and thereby reassure the speakers from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament too – our strong commitment to protecting jobs, to respect for workers, and I highlighted in my speech how important the tourism sector is for employment growth, especially for youth employment. I intend to continue to make every effort, as I did as Commissioner for Transport, to protect the rights of travellers, including tourists.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would remind you that, fortunately, we managed to adopt – with Parliament’s support too – the charter of passengers’ rights covering all transport sectors, especially for passengers with reduced mobility. I intend to build on this work to develop tourism packages, just as we did for air transport. I believe that, as Commissioner responsible for industry and tourism, I can continue this action which I launched as Commissioner for Transport; it is never specified, but I am the Commissioner responsible for industry, enterprise and tourism.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would repeat, we must capitalise on all sectors, including their specific features. I am thinking of food tourism, including the wonderful restaurants in Donostia-San Sebastián, perhaps among the best in Europe. Therefore every European area represents added value which, consequently, we should highlight. Lastly I would reply, in conclusion, to those of you who are concerned by an invasion by the European Commission: I do not take an invasive view of the Commission and the European Union; instead Europe can represent added value.</p>
      <p sl="it">There may be beautiful places in the EU which are worth visiting, but which the Chinese, Russians or South Americans have never heard of. Visiting Europe also means visiting these places, these other lesser-known places. It means offering the chance to develop the principle of subsidiarity in the field of tourism throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is what I intend to do, and I must thank, once more, Mr Fidanza for bringing Parliament’s politics in line with Commission politics with his report. I would like to reassure all the Members that I firmly pledge to continue my efforts so that tourism policy continues to gather ever greater momentum, so that tourism policy becomes ever stronger, so that it can genuinely become a key sector for growth, competitiveness, employment and the protection of the environment in our European Union.</p>

Mention was made earlier, for example, of the quality label: a round table has already been set up with operators in the tourist industry – so there is no desire to overstep the principle of subsidiarity nor to impose from on high solutions which have no backing – and it is under way and already functioning, and we can contribute to its work.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is the financial question – we said this earlier – and starting with the 2012 budget there are major pilot projects on cultural tourism, our industrial heritage, tourism and accessibility which have been tabled by some Members and which the whole of Parliament could support to ensure that certain resources are invested in important aspects, in the framework of the 2014-2020 financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">I also believe – I have almost finished, Mr President – that we will also have the chance over the coming months to develop certain specific aspects which we outlined in this report, which paints a picture, but we will be able to examine them in greater detail in specific own-initiative reports since we believe that they deserve to be further … (The President cut off the speaker)</p>

      <p sl="ro">Recent economic developments have highlighted the need for a coherent European tourism strategy. This should address the problems relating to social matters, territorial cohesion and the protection of natural and cultural assets. At the same time, it is important to develop a regional policy to support this sector. The EU Strategy for the Danube Region, which was a joint Romanian-Austrian initiative, provides a model for this. One initial result from implementing this strategy in our country is the opening of the Sfântu Gheorghe mini-port just last weekend.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Europe must also utilise the resources offered by ecotourism. For example, Romania is intending to set up a national network of tourist cycle routes in areas with picturesque landscapes. In order to promote Romania’s country brand, there are plans to diversify services so that the number of foreign tourists will double by 2015.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In a recent league table featuring the 50 most popular countries in the world, we find seven EU Member States among the first 10 destinations. This clearly shows that Europe has considerable tourism and cultural potential, but still offers opportunities which are untapped, in spite of the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the EU and Member States can identify new ways of attracting foreign tourists to Europe and encourage tourists to travel about more within the European Union, especially in connection with major cultural or sporting events. Multicultural Europe still has many traditional sights, but also has monuments and places off the beaten tourist track, which must be visited in connection with such events. Furthermore, tourist operators must be encouraged and supported in attracting tourists from non-EU countries so that tourism will continue to make a large contribution to European states’ GDP.</p>

      <p sl="en">Tourism represents 10% of EU GDP and provides jobs and a livelihood for 12% of Europe’s citizens. Tourism is also the most effective way of improving the global dissemination and promotion of Europe as a single destination, with the unique character and diversity of its regions. In order to support the sustainability and competitiveness of European tourism we need to work on training and the professional qualifications of people working in the tourism industry, and to invest in innovation and new technology. In this context, I consider Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs to be a suitable instrument for the development of new capabilities and skills in young people, who should subsequently be able not only to provide a livelihood for themselves, but also to create jobs for others in their local area.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is essential for the European tourism industry to gradually extend its seasonality. The Calypso programme, which would allow some categories of people (the young, the elderly and the disabled) to enjoy a holiday during the low season, may be an appropriate means to this end. The hustle and bustle of today’s world will result in ever greater interest in rural tourism and agro-tourism, nature tourism and spa and health tourism in the future. It is essential that that we are prepared for this change, and that European tourism offers adequate facilities, and not just to European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="es">I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fidanza, for an excellent report and for his good work in bringing on board the many ideas that have been put forward in this House to make European tourism a key asset of our economy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Tourism constitutes one of the Union’s largest sources of revenue, and in my country, Spain, it is essential to have a sound tourism policy that continues to attract tourists from across the world and helps to foster economic growth at a time of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Parliament has, for the first time, expressed itself politically on this subject, and it has done so by supporting the work of the Commission, but also by setting forth new ideas that enrich future tourism policy following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not a question of harmonising, as this is precluded by Article 195 of the Treaty, but of supplementing national policies to improve service quality, to couple the ‘Europe brand’ with national brands, and to create budget lines that reinforce national policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">With a view to countering seasonality in the sector, I have helped boost the role of social tourism, paying particular attention to tourism for the elderly on the basis of the Spanish experience. I considered it fundamental to support small and medium-sized enterprises and to develop entrepreneurship in the industry, as a driving force for employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The goal is to consolidate Europe’s image and visibility as a collection of sustainable, quality destinations, and to foster the competitiveness of the European tourist industry.</p>

Tourism is a key industry, and a source of growth and job creation. Europe needs tourism that is in phase with the modern world, the changes in world demand and the changes in our societies. We need tourism that is innovative and competitive but that also respects the environment, local cultures and local conditions. In a context of international competition between destinations, we have everything to gain from promoting our assets, our trades and our know-how, and from better communicating our unique European and national features. Therefore, the recent creation of a festival of French gastronomy celebrated on the first day of autumn is an excellent initiative that we should welcome. Sustainable tourism, cultural tourism, business and conference tourism, health tourism: these are the priorities. We should also establish Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the tourism field in the wake of the Arab Spring. We need to make every effort together to bring prosperity to the Mediterranean on the basis of common standards and projects.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The way forward for the development of tourism in Europe should be a common approach which also respects the diverse situations of the individual Member States. The development of tourism and its competitive potential is focussed on Central and Eastern Europe. These are countries which have acceded to the Union in recent years. Funding from European sources should be provided and expenditure on culture should be increased. The new challenges which Europe has set itself are economic development and the development of tourism, and flexibility depending on the situation. The historic industrial premises in Poland and other European countries as well as the building of new centres and historical and cultural buildings are a way of promoting by regions and cities. Industrial sites in Łódź, for example, have been rebuilt to house contemporary hotel and recreational areas or commercial infrastructure. A new element in the development of tourism is the reclamation of post-industrial sites. Creating artificial lakes in quarries, building artificial beaches, laying out cycle routes, planting forests, creating parks and transforming mine waste dumps into ski slopes are all examples of the utilisation of post-industrial sites for the purposes of tourism.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Tourism is a branch of the economy which brings in millions in earnings throughout the world. Europe, especially in times of crisis, cannot afford to lose out on this opportunity. Some of Europe’s regions have the chance to fend for themselves, thanks to their attractions and tourist base. However, there are regions which in spite of their advantages are not promoted properly and are not ready to take in tourists. This is why action to support the development of an infrastructure and marketing to ensure promotion is so important. The development of agritourism is a real opportunity for this branch of the economy. Skilful investment can create an opportunity for many new jobs in rural areas and the opportunity for tourists to be close to nature and be able to relax. It is also an opportunity to promote regional products, culture and traditions, and also ecological agriculture.</p>

      <p sl="en">Tourism is one of the most important parts of the tertiary sector, and its absorption capacity is not yet adequately appreciated by the various EU Member States. It is good that there are ever-increasing numbers of entities involved in this industry, and that the European Commission and European Parliament have recently been paying attention to it. The changing population structure in particular, whether in Europe or worldwide, brings with it a whole range of new tourism opportunities. These include important groups (the disabled, pensioners) that place specific demands on operators of tourist facilities. In recent years, there has been much talk of social tourism and new client sectors are emerging in developing countries. All of this places very high demands on the EU, as one of the leading destinations, in terms of improving the qualification structure of industry employees, promoting diversification in the range of tourism services on offer, and also coordinating the development of the industry as a whole. The anticipated 21 actions contained in Carlo Fidanza’s report may provide a good basis for concrete action by each Member State, and also for a coordinated effort at European Union level. In particular, the new ‘trademarks’ and innovations in the form of packages of different ‘routes’, whether by combined transport or by bicycle, car, train or water transportation, can be an important impetus for the further development of the industry. The EU must increase its efforts to maintain its position as the world's number one destination.</p>

      <p sl="pl">According to some forecasts, by 2020 the number of people aged 65 or more will form 20% of the population. This section of society has a potentially large amount of purchasing power and has plenty of free time, but at the same time requires a specialised form of tourism. The year 2012 has been declared European Year for Active Ageing. This will be an excellent opportunity to focus on the needs and preferences of this age group, and to promote different forms of activity and ways of spending free time which are targeted at the elderly. It would therefore be useful to draw up an appropriate strategy and exploit our possibilities and potential in creating an image of the European Union as an attractive and high-quality holiday destination. To achieve this, we must have highly-qualified personnel who will be able to adapt to new technologies and new market expectations. The Committee of the Regions believes that young people are playing a key role in creating jobs in the tourism sector, and this is the group which is currently most at risk of unemployment. According to the European Commission, one in five young people below the age of 25 in the EU is unemployed. This is why I feel that we should promote the idea of entrepreneurship, and also basic and advanced vocational training, which would provide opportunities for those young people just setting out in their careers and for those who already work in tourism, as well as for those who want to improve their skills.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to congratulate my fellow Member Carlo Fidanza on his report. In view of the current difficult economic circumstances, it is extremely important that we take advantage of every possible opportunity to create jobs. A key factor in this effort is to develop and create attractive and sustainable tourism in a number of regions across Europe. At the same time, it is important to remember that we live in an ageing society: the number of people above 60 will increase by 70% already in this decade. As such, there is a more pronounced demand not only for accessible tourism without barriers, but also for active outdoor activities for the elderly. Carlo Fidanza recognised the importance of these criteria, and included in his report my suggestions concerning barrier-free tourism, accessible to everyone. This would make it possible for families with small children, the elderly, and 80 million citizens living with disabilities to have equal access to services in this area, and enjoy their well-deserved leisure time actively, thereby increasing market demand for European tourism.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon the importance of tourism, too, has been part of the competence of the European Union. No wonder, as tourism is a sector that is capable of positively influencing the economic growth of the EU, stimulating job creation, and contributing to development. Consequently, there is a difference as to what efforts we make in order to reinforce European tourism and maintain its competitiveness. In 2008 a total of over 370 million tourists visited the EU Member States, accounting for 40% of the world’s tourist traffic. This makes Europe the number one tourist destination among holidaymakers. There is an immense potential yet to be exploited in European tourism due to our excellent geographic position, and we should definitely make use of it. I believe that there is no part of the EU that could not offer something that is unique in the whole world. There is, for example, health tourism; Central Europe has vast reserves of spas, and the region is home to exceptional and entirely unique medicinal baths. We need to take joint action to popularise our history and the roots of our Christian culture together. We must be able to acquaint visitors with the culinary art of our various regions. We must find ways to make Europe more marketable. We must give incentive to EU-level support to tourism and enhanced cooperation between Member States. We must be able to respond and adapt to societal changes, because this is the only way that we can hope for our tourism to be successful.</p>

      <p sl="it">I would like to thank Mr Fidanza for his constructive work.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tourism has enormous potential for achieving certain important EU objectives, such as sustainable development, economic growth and employment, as well as socio-economic cohesion. In recent years, growth in employment in the tourism industry has been considerably higher than in other areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, the EU tourism sector generates more than 4% of GDP, with around 2 million businesses providing work for approximately 4% of the total workforce: around 8 million jobs. Therefore there is a clear need to support the sector, including by improving training and recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="it">At European level, the Union must put in place an integrated strategy with clear, high-level objectives, with effective, targeted measures that promote innovation and improve the quality of tourist services, providing, for example, ever greater accessibility for persons with reduced mobility.

      <p sl="pl">The tourism sector is a very important branch of the economy, generating a great deal of employment particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, creating opportunities for development of non-industrialised regions, and contributing significantly to the national budgets of EU Member States. In the report that was presented today, its author put forward many important issues which need to be solved to simplify travel for the purposes of tourism, so that the sector becomes even more profitable, the aim being to promote Europe and its cultural heritage fully. What is essential is integrated action for the promotion and development of the tourism infrastructure through greater cooperation at national, regional and local level as well as cross-border cooperation, not forgetting to coordinate action with other sectors that may be directly involved. In the virtual sphere we need to expand and maximise the potential of our portal, www.visiteurope.com, and to integrate ticket sales systems for various forms of transport so that crossing borders by rail in particular will not cause excessive difficulties. A major improvement will also be the EU-wide harmonisation of classification systems for accommodation establishments, and the promotion and sale of holiday packages for important cultural and sporting events. However, we must not forget about incidents such as the one which took place in Iceland, and we must also draw up crisis control scenarios so that during natural disasters the rights of tourists and passengers are not violated.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his very fair and comprehensive attitude towards the issue of strengthening Europe’s position on the global tourist map. The document was prepared at a good time for the European Union, which is still the most popular tourist destination in the world, in terms of the number of people arriving from outside the EU. However, we should remember that even a dominant position requires constant strengthening, especially in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, one of the best ideas for strengthening the leading position of the EU as the most popular tourist destination in the world is the promotion of travel to Central and Eastern Europe, especially in the context of the introduction of European heritage trails. For almost the whole of the second half of the 20th century, Central and Eastern Europe was almost completely excluded from normal tourist traffic. Taking into account the growing competition from other tourist destinations outside the EU, and also the fact that we cannot increase our competitiveness by basing our marketing on the same places we have been promoting for over half a century, I believe that opening European tourism towards the east is vital, this being an area which is not well known either in the European Union itself or worldwide.</p>

However, light needs to be shed on the underlying factors. Deep recession as a result of across-the-board austerity measures was forecast from the outset but the forecast was not taken into proper account. The troika insisted on obtaining a commitment on unfeasible fiscal targets and the Greek government passively accepted everything and, of course, failed to deliver.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, however, a clientelist network of protection and obscurity has been maintained. In vain have we proposed simple and effective measures to verify assets obtained through corruption and tax evasion. A recent law on buildings erected without planning permission wipes out fines totalling over EUR 10 billion. It has taken months of laborious effort to verify the origin of funds for Greek deposits abroad, and not just to tax interest, which is what the Greek government was trying to do.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this year, in Portugal, more than 3 000 firms closed their doors, investment and industrial output fell to the levels of 15 years ago, and agricultural output declined to a level not seen for 16 years. The programme of aggression, impoverishment and extortion conceived by the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank is clearly compounding and aggravating this scenario. The recession is upon us. People in general are seeing their incomes fall as the cost of living rises, and the attack on strategic state-owned or partly state-owned companies is being prepared. Unemployment is spreading and with it poverty, while genuine social dramas are becoming ever more frequent. Is not the disaster we are witnessing in Greece enough for them to reverse course?Hence we wish to hail the struggle of Portuguese workers and the Portuguese people, of which the demonstrations by the CGTP Intersindical this coming 1 October will be a vivid expression. Certainly many thousands will be participating to say ‘no’ to injustices and blanket impoverishment and to give voice to their refusal to allow the recipes of this troika to despoil their present and rob them of their future.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I am happy to inform the House that last week Greece paid coupons of EUR 769 million on bonds that mature in 2037 and 2040 respectively. It proved once again that, in the face of stubborn specialists and non-specialists, with and without competence, Greece is discharging its financial obligations, while the people have suffered a massive squeeze on their income, to the point at which they cannot withstand any more.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners who have stood by Greece. I refer to Ms Merkel, who has given her full assurance that, so far, Greece is paying over par for the loans given to us. In response to the solidarity and honesty of the German people, I would ask them to read carefully the article in the Sunday edition of Die Welt setting out all the information on the forced occupation loan which increases Germany’s debt to Greece by 70 billion …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in the Belgian city of Antwerp, a Sharia court is currently being established. The initiative is coming from the radical organisation Islam for Belgium. The aim is to create a parallel legal system. The court is intended, in particular, to provide mediation in family law disputes. In doing so, self-appointed judges will apply Sharia law instead of Belgian family law.</p>
      <p sl="de">For women that means suppression, as women and men do not have the same rights under Sharia law. Criminal law is also to be handled. Legal experts fear that this will prevent the Belgian authorities from prosecuting so-called cultural crimes such as honour killings and forced marriages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sharia courts reinforce parallel societies that have nothing in common with our understanding of human rights. If we allow Muslims to found their own Sharia courts, it will be the end of a Europe of freedom and the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, at this critical time for the European economy, the least one would expect from the European Union would be for it to speak in a coordinated manner. Instead, we have a storm of uncoordinated and often contradictory statements, interviews and opinions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Everyone is talking: Council, Commission, Commissioners, ministers, deputy ministers, the Central Bank, associates, advisors, advisors’ advisors, assistants’ assistants; it is a real ‘European Babel’. This makes the markets nervous, reinforces uncertainty, increases distrust and erodes effectiveness. In Greece’s particular case, it is receiving simultaneous messages of solidarity and punishment, of support and threat, of optimism and catastrophe. This perpetual swinging back and forth is doing a great deal of harm. It is further disorienting an entire nation, an entire society, which is already at the end of its tether. We need to put an end to this European Babel and we need to do so now, today, not tomorrow. It would be good for Greece, good for Europe and good for Europe’s status, credibility and effectiveness.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at the last plenary session I raised the issue of TalkTalk’s plan to close its call centre in Waterford with the loss of up to 575 jobs at just 30 days’ notice. Following this, the company wrote to me with a thinly-veiled threat of legal action. They copied their letter to the EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, László Andor, whom I had asked to verify the company’s compliance with EU employment legislation.

We expect strong leadership from the Commission to overcome pressures coming from some inefficient Member States. The TEN-T core network has to be compulsory for Member States.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the changing situation in the Basque Country leads me once again to alert Parliament to the worrying behaviour for European democracy of one of the Member States, namely Spain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In May, it required a last-minute appeal decision, passed by only 1 vote, by Spain’s constitutional court to allow the Basque independence movement Bildu’s list of candidates to stand in the local elections. The fact is, those candidates received 25% of the vote. The attempt to ban them was therefore an attempt to undermine the democratic expression of the Basque people, which is wholly unacceptable and even inconceivable at the very heart of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then, in July, I personally attended a hearing in the trial of Mr Otegi, the leader of the left-wing Basque independence movement, and several of his friends. In reality, they were being prosecuted for thought crimes; the court has just handed them the maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment, a sentence that is wholly disproportionate, deliberately excessive and which has shocked all of democratic society, both in the Basque Country and in Madrid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament must voice its disapproval of the Spanish Government’s policy towards the Basque Country, at the very time when the political developments are such that a peace process of the Northern Ireland kind could result in a long-term political solution that benefits the Basques, the citizens of Spain themselves and all the citizens of Europe.</p>

At the same time, he called for his case to be investigated further and for the truth to come out.</p>

What is even worse for us is when it happens in a country with which, traditionally, we have good relations. The European Parliament has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the death penalty.

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, on Saturday 19-year-old Angel Petrov was deliberately knocked down by a car and killed on the spot. The man detained for his murder is an associate of the gypsy boss – and proven criminal – Kiril Rashkov. The following evening, an angry mob gathered outside Kiril Rashkov’s house and set it on fire.</p>
      <p sl="bg">These are some of the extremely ugly scenes which have occurred in my country. Kiril Rashkov was caught unawares by the arrival of democracy, while serving a 30-year sentence for a wide variety of crimes.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, last week the European Union abandoned, I hope only for a short time, one of the basic principles on which it is founded: equality among its members.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The JHA Council left the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area in abeyance, even though both states have met all the technical criteria, according to the experts. I feel that the refusal by a Dutch minister to keep a promise made by the EU through the accession treaties has gone too far. This has happened just when I think that the Dutch public has confidence in Romania, as Dutch investors are top of the league in my country, with subscribed capital amounting to EUR 5.37 billion, held in nearly 4 000 majority-controlled companies.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Romania’s failure to join Schengen, although it can be explained by Romania’s representatives’ inability to present this case convincingly, has, unfortunately, a negative impact on the whole Romanian population, not only on those in government who have demonstrated, once again, that they are not up to the task they have been given.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, this point was overlooked when the vote was held on Romania’s accession to the Schengen area, with the states which openly opposed this move failing to take into account the far-reaching implications which a vote against Romania could have.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that, in future, this hostile and purely simplistic attitude will be replaced by one reflecting the real spirit of the European Union, whereby we must not punish a Member State and its whole population just because they have foolish leaders.</p>

This year alone there have now been at least four occurrences of self-immolation in Kirti. Such a radical form of protest illustrates the despair of the Tibetans, who are seeking freedom of religion as well as meaningful autonomy in the historic area of Tibet. Continuous desperate acts of protest also demonstrate that Tibetans determinedly resist the ongoing violations of human rights and cultural genocide that are being carried out in Tibet.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, after my visit to Kazakhstan on behalf of the European United Left Group, the government launched a slanderous campaign against me. That included the fabrication of a statement by the Chair of the Central Asia Delegation, and now an official communication to the EU from Kazakhstan suggesting that I broke Kazakhstan criminal law by creating social discord and declaring that ‘the Republic of Kazakhstan has the right to declare the abovementioned officials’ – referring to myself and my political adviser – ‘as persona non grata’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why have they taken this approach? Because I supported the heroic oil workers who have been on strike for four months now, fighting for decent wages and conditions, fighting for the right to an independent and free trade union, workers who have faced violent repression from company thugs, from State forces. Two people have now been murdered – a trade unionist and the daughter of a trade unionist. Natalia Sokolova, the lawyer of the workers, has been jailed for six years for stirring up social conflict.

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the new Law on Education adopted this year in Romania defines the University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Târgu Mureş as – amongst others – a multicultural higher education institution, where half of the student body is already made up of Hungarian nationals. While the law which was passed stipulates the establishment of a separate Hungarian faculty, the university’s ethnic-majority management is unwilling to comply. In an institution officially recognised as multicultural, and where half the students are Hungarian, the management are doing everything in their power to prevent them from studying medicine in their own language.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is, essentially, the typical multicultural and minority-friendly policy that aptly reflects the attitudes taken towards the issue in certain Member States. The review of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria has brought into focus the treatment of minorities by states wishing to accede to the EU. However, it is also necessary to guarantee accountability for compliance with the Copenhagen criteria even after accession. Interethnic relations are tense in Europe, particularly in the Eastern regions; ignoring this would be a huge mistake, which could have considerable adverse implications in the future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we are now discussing what the next budget period in the seven years starting from 2014 will be like. I personally believe that we should be talking more about our young people, our future generation, in this period.</p>
      <p sl="sk">When discussing the budget, we should surely talk about programmes and programme support over the next seven years, and not just mobility programmes and education programmes such as the Erasmus programme, but also other programmes that are important for young people. The main one is the Youth in Action programme, which helps young people to get an informal education, experience and perhaps a different view of the world from the one they would get in school.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, we should therefore definitely support this programme in the coming period, as well as all of its components, just as they are. I also particularly support the non-profit and non-governmental youth organisations which are the prime movers in this, helping young people to gain experience and providing a space for them in which they can develop themselves and acquire their own outlook on the future.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area was postponed last week until an unspecified date. Two Member States, the Netherlands and Finland, opposed this measure, without giving any reasons in line with EU legislation. These Member States have not only blocked access to the Schengen area, they have also prevented both states from meeting the obligations arising from the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think it is unfair and unproductive to use reasons linked to domestic policy when making decisions at EU level. The European Parliament has already given a vote of consent on this matter. I think that it needs to come back and express its opinion very clearly, once again, particularly concerning compliance with EU regulations and respect among Member States.</p>

Instead of proposing measures to eliminate a more than 40% heat loss from Romania’s centralised heating system, the Boc government has cut the heating subsidy for low-income families.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, during the current part-session we are facing a very important vote on the six-pack, five regulations and one directive, which aim to strengthen economic governance in Europe in the light of the adverse experience of the economic crisis. This strengthening is to be achieved primarily by a fundamental reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, which has been found to be ineffective in preventing crises, as has been brutally exposed by the recent turmoil in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="pl">After the initial green light given to the legislative package by the Ecofin Council at its meeting in Wrocław, the fate of the six-pack lies in Parliament’s hands. Only if it is adopted quickly will it be able to calm the recent instability in the financial markets and prevent another recession, something which is looking ever more likely. However, we cannot allow a similar situation to the one we had before our recess, when disputes within the Council prevented the rapid adoption of the package.

Billions will be poured into a stabilisation mechanism from the coffers of eurozone Member States. A brand new official will be placed in charge – the European Minister of Finance.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the present exceptional situation as a result of the financial, economic and budgetary crisis, decisions at European level should concentrate on urgent and important matters. That is the only way to rebuild our citizens’ trust in the sincerity of our actions.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report deals with the strategy to prevent untold human suffering as a result of around 35 000 deaths and more than 1.5 million, often serious, injuries every year as a result of road accidents and to prevent the associated economic damage of EUR 130 billion a year. The number of deaths alone corresponds to what we would see if 250 fully occupied, medium-sized scheduled aircraft were to crash. Would we not do everything in our power to prevent that? The costs resulting from accidents exceed the European Union’s total annual budget by a considerable amount. I am therefore certain that it will be to our advantage to take long-term action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thanks to the constructive cooperation of all shadow rapporteurs and many fellow Members we have succeeded for the first time with this report in drawing up a uniform, integrated, coherent approach to improving road safety. It takes into account the content of the UN Road Safety Charter 2010 to 2020 as well as the content and objectives of the road safety work done by the EU Member States and broader groups in civil society. For the first time, it contains ambitious, but realistic, objectives for the period up to 2020, with the ‘vision zero’ for the period after that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thus, the aim is to reduce the number of fatal accidents by 50%, although those involving children by as much as 60%, and to reduce the number of people seriously injured by 40%. That is very much in the interests of every single one of our citizens, but also of our economy. To the Member States, we recommend adapting the targets and methods to their territory and we expect them to produce their own road safety action programmes.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the report specifies who is responsible for the individual activities and measures. This is by no means just the European Union. In the spirit of subsidiarity, the integrated approach means that the Member States, undertakings with regional or municipal responsibilities, indeed even each individual road user also has to take responsibility in terms of their duty of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, the report states how – in other words with which instruments, activities and measures – the objectives are to be met. Legislative proposals at European level are just one strategy. We cannot, and do not wish to, do without guidelines, recommendations and instructions. In this regard, particular attention must be given to the principle of subsidiarity, which means that areas of responsibility are clearly specified, including where responsibilities are split.</p>
      <p sl="de">We value the diverse activities of the Commission. However, as they emanate from many different Directorates General, such as Mobility and Transport, Economic and Financial Affairs, Environment, Communication, Research and Innovation, Internal Market and Services and others, they are not always coherent, are often uncoordinated and sometimes they contradict one another. Therefore, we propose that a Road Safety Coordinator be appointed within the European Commission. In the long term, that will avoid the establishment of an agency for road safety and increase the efficiency of the European Commission enormously. Both the choice of measures and their evaluation require a scientifically sound approach based on comparable, high-quality data, definitions and statistics. We are therefore calling, among other things, for a harmonised analysis of the causes of injuries and accidents and the EU-wide exchange of data, whilst maintaining stringent personal data protection standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have identified six main areas for action. They concern people as road users, the road traffic rules, vehicles, infrastructure, the smart networking of vehicles and infrastructure and particular consideration for vulnerable road users. I ask for your support tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I would like to present some statistics. In 2009, more than 35 000 people died in road accidents in the EU, and more than 1 500 000 were injured. For every fatal accident there are statistically another four accidents entailing severe permanent disabilities, and 10 accidents entailing severe injuries. Rural roads account for 55% of fatal accidents, urban areas 36% and motorways 6%. The payment of social benefits, which also involves our money and taxpayers' money, involves costs of up to EUR 130 billion a year.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, road safety is an enormous challenge, especially with the ever increasing number of vehicles on the roads. The accident numbers are alarming. The 35 000 deaths and 1.5 million injuries a year mentioned earlier are too much.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The proposed reduction set by the EU for the number of dead and injured by 2020 is a target that will be difficult to achieve, but protecting the lives of our fellow citizens is our most important task. Member States have already implemented many proposals or have always had them in place, such as restrictions on alcohol in the blood, where I support absolute zero tolerance. However, harmonisation is necessary, and in many cases it is lacking. It is also important to support and improve international cooperation and to fight together against dangerous drivers for greater safety and the protection of all of us and our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 35 000 people were killed in 2009. The target that we set ourselves of halving the annual number of deaths has not been met. This report is a timely response to an urgent need for action. It proposes original and innovative solutions, especially via life-long education and training, as well as improvements to infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wish to raise two points in the very brief time that I am allowed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As my colleague has just pointed out, a zero alcohol limit for new drivers in the first two years and at all times for professional drivers is an altogether positive and realistic measure, since a scientific margin of error will now be permitted, thereby enabling this mechanism to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for drink-driving, I support the call for alcolocks to be fitted to all new commercial passenger and goods transport vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, given the importance of the debate on subsidiarity, I would like to stress in this case too that, behind these worthy measures, there lies the fact, let us not forget, that millions of Europeans are today highly mobile and that harmonisation is a necessity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yes indeed, we should concentrate on urgent and important matters in connection with road safety. I am firmly convinced of that, and in my opinion that means first and foremost the two greatest reducers of attentiveness while driving, namely alcohol and excessive speed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union must also say something in this regard and not merely propose technical measures, which, although good in my opinion, are a long way from being adequate. In towns and cities in particular, lack of attentiveness – the problem of inattentive drivers – is particularly dramatic. Therefore, the speed must be lowered here. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that there was a broad majority in favour of the recommendation for a 30 km/h speed limit.</p>
      <p sl="de">Particular consideration must be given – this is also contained in the report, and I consider it to be important and positive – to finally focusing our attention on vulnerable road users, and I hope that these measures will at last, once and for all, actually be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, every death is tragic and unnecessary, but a death in a road accident is always an unexpected shock. In view of the frequency of such unhappy events we must do everything to further improve safety on Europe’s roads. The figure of 35 000 victims a year is absolutely astronomical, and yet we have managed to bring it down in recent years. Even one tragic accident is a lot, and I therefore very much applaud the proposal of the Fellow Member who calls on the Commission to adopt a target of zero mortality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The Commission’s commitment to reduce fatalities on the roads by half over 10 years may be ambitious, and we would all be pleased if it was achieved, but it is also rather dubious from an ethical standpoint. In the long term we should try to prevent any unnecessary death. We will not achieve that just through regulations, however, but mainly through behaviour on the roads. The main problem is aggressive drivers. The Commission should therefore consider measures that are both restrictive and educational, in order to eliminate such behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Along with efforts to harmonise road signs and traffic regulations, we should focus more on developing a safe transport infrastructure. New, modern knowledge and technologies such as self-illuminating roads and double shoulders should also be supported by EU funding, as should rumble strips or intelligent road signs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We should also continue to improve the passive safety of motor vehicles, and apply the latest knowledge on mitigating the effects of vehicle collisions. It would also be good to support an expansion of modern assistance systems, such as driver fatigue detectors or adaptive cruise control systems.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur and his colleagues for their support for the Commission’s proposed road safety policy orientations 2011-2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the main messages in this report is that everybody can contribute to road safety, at the level of the EU institutions, Member States, regional or local authorities, NGOs, the industry and the citizens themselves who have, as wisely highlighted in the report, not only a right but also a duty to contribute to road safety.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly pleased to see that the report supports the Commission’s ambitious target to halve the number of deaths by 2020. One Member mentioned that we are worried about increasing accidents. Accidents actually are declining and the last period of this road safety action plan saw the decline of casualties by 47%. But still, every death is a tragedy – I totally agree – and we must fight to halve the number of deaths by 2020. I agree that, in the longer term, a ‘Vision Zero’ strategy where no one is killed on EU roads should be developed, and this goal has been integrated in the White Paper on Transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the substance of road safety policies and measures, the Commission is ready to support most of the proposed actions and appreciates that they are addressed not only to the Commission but also to Member States, and industry should play its part too.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to already give you my reaction to two topics that are more specifically addressed to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first one is the idea of establishing an ‘EU Road Safety Coordinator’ as part of the Commission. I understand the reason behind this proposal. In my opinion, such a coordinator should mainly act as an ambassador for existing actions, with a general mission of promoting road safety rather than coordinating or monitoring road safety policies and legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the report calls on the Commission to produce, by the end of 2011, a fully-fledged action programme incorporating a detailed set of measures with clear timetables for their implementation. We are, of course, reflecting on a number of high priority issues, such as injuries and safety of motorcyclists. My services have started to work with relevant experts on the definition of injuries. Besides, in early October the High Level Group on Road Safety will meet to discuss the concrete implementation of the Commission orientations. The Commission will carry out appropriate impact assessments before envisaging any legislative measure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is grateful for the many useful and innovative ideas expressed. We will duly consider all these proposals when translating the road safety policy orientations into concrete actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will keep Parliament closely informed of progress made on the implementation of the road safety policy orientations 2011-2020. I can count on the firm support and commitment of the European Parliament to improve road safety when road safety legislative proposals will be put on the table of the core legislators. I am very happy that Parliament, before the summer break, adopted a very big decision about cross-border enforcement of traffic violations, fighting against four killers – alcohol, speed, failure to stop at red lights and non-use of seat-belts. So a very important step has been made and, in general, we all share the same objective: to reduce casualties and injuries. The question in detail is cultural background, different practices in Member States, where we can of course find common ground, but we also must also ensure that the objectives are the same and that everybody is working hard. So let us allow the Member States to take most of the responsibility for implementing these actions.</p>

      <p sl="it">EU citizens are entitled to a high level of road safety. The statistics are encouraging: in recent years, Europe’s roads have become safer; indeed, between 2001 and 2009 the number of road deaths in the EU fell by 36%. The Third European Road Safety Action Programme 2001-2010 was instrumental in bringing about that fall, since it made progress in the field of road safety and helped save precious lives. A recent Commission communication sets out the new strategic objectives, in particular the ambitious proposal to halve by 2020 the total number of road deaths in the EU. Although I support and welcome the Commission’s objectives, we cannot fail to seek the highest degree of coordination possible at local, regional, national and European level in the preparation and implementation of the measures to be executed. Nevertheless, if current EU structures remain unchanged, decisive action to develop this integrated strategy is unlikely. I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to create the office of European Road Safety Coordinator which, with the Commission’s support, will play a valuable role by liaising between the various levels of intervention.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The subject of road traffic safety is particularly important even from our point of view, as we travel the length and breadth of Europe every week to sittings in Strasbourg and parliamentary work in Brussels. I believe that the report is generally correct in pointing out the need to reduce the number of traffic fatalities by adopting Vision Zero. Nevertheless, there are measures contained in the report which may cause controversy, such as the fitting of equipment which would check drivers’ blood alcohol levels before they set out in their cars. However, I feel more positive about the proposals for the emergency services to be given additional training to help road traffic casualties, for the harmonisation and implementation of provisions, for the creation of a road infrastructure geared principally towards user safety and for the protection of vulnerable road users. Therefore I think that we should spend more time creating a common vision in the field of road user safety in Europe, while trying to maintain a measure of rationality.</p>

      <p sl="de">The majority of Europe’s road network is designed to cater for the typical dimensions of modern heavy goods vehicles. The Commission favours ‘gigaliners’, however. ‘Gigaliners’ are up to 25 metres in length and weigh up to 60 tonnes. These giants impair the field of vision of other drivers and the overtaking distances on national roads are increased dramatically. Furthermore, much greater damage, both to people and vehicles, is to be expected when collisions occur. The EU’s plans to halve the number of fatal road accidents by 2020 thus seems like pie in the sky. Moreover, we can expect an increase in road haulage. I am therefore decidedly in favour of banning ‘gigaliners’ from our roads and favouring safer modes of transport like shipping.</p>

      <p sl="et">Traffic safety in Europe is an extremely important topic, considering that in 2009 over 35 000 people died and more than 1 500 000 were injured in road accidents in the European Union. Although statistical data show that traffic deaths have fallen more than 30% in the last 10 years, that figure is nevertheless below the set target of 50%. In addition to saving lives, the improvement of traffic safety is also accompanied by social savings, because the social cost of traffic accidents in 2009 was assessed at EUR 130 billion. This is a considerable amount; in comparison, it is a quarter of the amount required to fund the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism. Returning to the topic of traffic safety, one must take into consideration that of traffic accidents ending in death: 55% take place on rural roads, 36% in urban settlements, and 6% on motorways. This is important information from the point of view of continuing the reduction of traffic deaths and for the development of legislation and various initiative programmes. This report fully supports the objective of reducing the total number of deaths from traffic accidents in the EU by half by the year 2020, and demands that new clear and measurable objectives be set for the same period: to reduce by 60% traffic deaths of children under the age of 14; to reduce deaths of pedestrians and cyclists in traffic accidents by 50%; and to reduce life-threatening injuries by 40%. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, we need common and harmonised rules, since the transport sector is notably international. I request that you all support this report.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, quite rightly we debated for the last half an hour or so the causes and prevention of unnecessary deaths on European roads. My report on dam infrastructures in developing countries is geared to the same subject: preventing unnecessary deaths from floods that are caused by glacier retreats in the Hindu Kush Himalayan range and also in Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="en">Flying in a helicopter at 18 000 feet at the top of the Himalayas and at the Everest base camp, I saw beautiful water-bound lakes below me. They were the most dangerous things I have seen for a long time. I then met with ICIMOD, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, which has identified 8 000 glacial lakes in the Hindu Kush Himalayas alone, 203 of which they have declared to be extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two weeks ago Nepal experienced an earthquake, not reported in Europe but certainly reported in Asia, where many people died. This earthquake measured 9.69 on the Richter scale. Thank goodness those dams did not break.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reason why these glacial lakes are being created and why natural glacial lakes with natural moraines, as they call them, are being created is that the glaciers are melting faster at certain periods in the year. The water from these glaciers normally feeds the greatest rivers in the world – the Ganges, the Yellow River, the Brahmaputra, the Darya – and they feed billions of people. In fact, 1.3 billion people eat rice and grow wheat on the river banks of these greatest agricultural assets in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, because of accelerated glacier melting and the natural accumulation of water in these 8 000 glacial lakes, they are bursting and flash flooding, and we now have periods of enormous floods, as we experienced recently in Pakistan when 20 million people – 20 million people! – were made homeless and many thousands of people starved. 500 000 people had to be fed emergency food and the wheat crop was destroyed for whole periods of years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again the floods returned to Pakistan this July and, as we speak, there are vast areas of Pakistan inundated with water; parts of India are inundated with water. The routine, managed drawdown of water on these great rivers of the Ganges, on the Himalayan range, is no longer predictable. Water is accumulating in the oddest places; I have seen it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now it is impossible, I think, for us to repair these moraines because they are naturally formed, but we can control the outlet of water by alternative mitigation methods, siphons and the construction of open channels and tunnels in order to lower the water level in the glacial lakes, and by controlling the water flow into the local river system to use the water as a reservoir for use.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is much work to be done and I call for an international agency of the United Nations to be created, through the EU’s support, so that India, Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan and other countries can come together under the auspices of the UN.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, at the moment we have a situation where we know that, as a result of reinforcements which are lacking or have not been fitted at all, some countries have only narrowly averted disaster. Equally, where they are needed they have not always been constructed. We must realise that with climate change we will encounter anomalous weather conditions from time to time, we will probably come across situations when a particular country will be flooded time and time again. That is why it is important to build very good systems. We know how to build dams because they are not water installations of which we have no knowledge. This is not new technology. This is old, effective technology. It is therefore just a question of being able to give these countries information about how to do it.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, floods may be described as one of the most destructive forces of nature, in terms of loss of life and damage to property. The least developed countries are the most vulnerable, due to climate and the lack of flood management measures. It is therefore important to adopt a multi-level flood management strategy, particularly in regions where unstable glacier lakes represent a critical flood risk.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I agree with the rapporteur, who warns against relying on large dams to prevent flood damage, especially in the context of climate change. It is likely that extreme precipitation will increase the intensity and frequency of flash floods, which can reduce the safety level of dams. Moreover, according to the conclusions of the World Commission on Dams, the financial return on large dam projects continues to be uncertain. In financial terms, the environmental and social costs of large dams have not been sufficiently taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, water is a resource in short supply, even though it covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface. It is vital for life, but can also cause major natural disasters, whether by drought or flooding.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We encounter this paradox when we deal with the subject of dams. In many instances, dams are the only means of supplying energy to communities isolated due to mountainous or hilly relief. At the same time, these systems provide a clean source of electricity. However, if there are flaws in their construction, this causes an adverse ecological and social impact.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should emphasise that any new projects in this area must be based on extensive impact assessments, starting with the recommendations from the World Commission on Dams. Therefore, I call on the Commission to promote these issues in discussions with other countries.</p>

I would also like to thank him for the opportunity this gives me, on behalf of the Commission, to address this issue.</p>

This is, of course, always very important.</p>

      <p sl="en">At global level, the EU is already fully engaged in fighting climate change and its effects. By its commitments in Copenhagen and Cancun, the Commission is thus fully engaged in supporting developing countries in implementing adaptation and mitigation measures, as included in the national development strategies and plans. In particular, at local level, the EU also promotes projects of sustainable development with small-scale operations more adapted to the local environment. Moreover, the report rightly highlights that glacier melting is increasing worldwide and is particularly intense – as was rightly pointed out in the report – in the Himalaya mountain range. The resulting increase in water flow has important impacts on downstream areas in some of the world’s most important river basins and densely populated agricultural areas, in particular in Asia, where 16 000 glaciers exist.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, the Commission welcomes the report and acknowledges that glacier melting in the Himalaya and the related glacier lake outburst floods are a growing problem which demands specific attention. Addressing this problem and other climate change-related issues will require a cross-border approach involving expertise in disaster risk reduction, watershed management, rural development and climate change adaptation. In this regard, the EU is already teaming up with the regional institutions with expertise in this field, such as the ICIMOD, a Nepal-based institute referred to in the EP report, as well as with the governments of the affected regions, in order to discuss possible actions and cooperation. For instance, overall support for the Asian region in the fight against climate change, including water basin management, is being provided as part of the Commission’s fast-starting financing through the Global Climate Change Alliance in Nepal and the new programme which will start in Bhutan in 2012.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Gabriele Zimmer, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on an EU policy framework to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges (2010/2100(INI)) - (A7-0284/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="1-206-000" speaker_id="28248" name="Gabriele ZIMMER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Germany" birth_date="07-05-1955" birth_place="Berlin" p_group="Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left" m_state="DE">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in an appeal initiated by African and European writers regarding the famine in the Horn of Africa it is stated that those suffering do not need sympathy, they need their rights as citizens of this world to be realised. Like people everywhere else, they have rights, which also include the right to food in accordance with Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Horn of Africa, 12.5 million people are currently being deprived of their right to life and to food security. In Somalia alone, more than 30 000 children under five have died in recent months. According to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the current estimate of the number of people who are suffering from hunger worldwide is already over a billion once again.</p>
      <p sl="de">In drawing up the report that we have before us today, the members of the Committee on Development were guided by two premises: the first was the question of whether the European Union is taking adequate responsibility to ensure that those in the world suffering from hunger have direct access to food – that can also be extended to clean drinking water and a supply of energy. The second was: how will the European Union ensure the necessary coherence between its policies in order to succeed in its development policy objectives on the basis of Articles 7 and 208 of the Treaty of Lisbon?</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of the two Commission communications from last year on the EU policy framework to assist developing countries and on humanitarian food assistance, I can say that the Commission has laid down a number of premises that we as a committee support, but that we are of the opinion that the approaches taken in many areas are still inadequate. It is not sufficiently clear, for example, how the necessary coherence between all relevant policy areas is to be ensured, and how, in particular in international trade policy, the appropriate adjustments are to be made in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy. One crucial deficiency that remains is the fact that the fight against hunger in the world is afforded nothing like the necessary priority status on the political agendas of international institutions, including that of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Famines rarely develop overnight. There are many causes. There is no point in listing them all here. Our report makes them very clear. It is clear that climate change, speculation on the stock markets and price volatility, which we have to get our heads around, land-grabbing and unfair trade policy have a negative impact first and foremost on the very poorest people – on refugees, the poor, the elderly and vulnerable women and children.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our report, we have focused on three main points. Firstly, we support – and we would like to develop this point further – a human rights-based approach as the general framework for food security. Enforcement of the human right to food must be at the top of the political agendas, and we need monitoring mechanisms in order to check that the right to food is being applied in practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sustainable agriculture based on small, independent farms with low external inputs holds out the possibility of a solution in the fight against hunger, malnutrition and poverty. For this, investment in agriculture needs to be substantially increased. The same applies to specific measures for ensuring global food security, as well as to the fight against speculation and uncontrolled land purchase. The scale of uncontrolled land acquisition is far greater than previously thought. The latest figures we have received, in relation to Uganda, for example, reveal over 22 000 instances of people being driven from their land because the land has been bought up by British timber companies.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third major point is that we need the appropriate policy coherence that we are calling for, so that, at the end of the day, we do not have a situation where we have development policy on the one hand, with funds being poured into it, and agricultural policy and trade policy on the other hand cancelling out precisely what development policy is trying to achieve. In this regard, there is still a great deal to be done. I would ask for your support for the report in tomorrow’s vote.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in addition to being an increasingly serious humanitarian problem, the global food crisis poses a major threat to peace and security worldwide. The ever-growing threat of food speculation, climate change, biofuels, loss of biodiversity, land degradation and pressures on water resources are the main causes of hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the clear political choice to propose the right to food as a cornerstone of the European Union’s policy framework. Ensuring food security requires coherence and coordination of the various sectoral policies at EU level, namely development policy, the common agricultural policy, the common trade policy, energy policy and research programmes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Additionally, the European Union and partner countries should establish transparent monitoring mechanisms, including the participation of civil society organisations and local authorities, in order to guarantee that right to food policies will be properly implemented.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, food security in developing countries, particularly in certain parts of Africa, must be regarded as a challenge that requires a rapid solution. Millions of people are hungry, and that cannot be acceptable to the EU. If we do not change, we face the threat of negative humanitarian and security impacts on a global scale.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The response of the international community has so far been slow and insufficient. EU Member States must fundamentally increase their involvement in the transformation of humanitarian aid into development aid and a development policy. First and foremost, this involves the development of agriculture and rural areas. In the long term, a key task will be to support education programmes with the widest possible access for all those who need it. The launch of these regular education programmes should provide an effective way of getting out of this dead end street and avoiding going down it again.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, food security in developing countries is literally a matter of life and death, as can be seen from the current situation in Africa. It is the moral obligation of the Union to act and to choose the right form of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am in favour of EU assistance being targeted at the sustainable small-scale production of food, in order to increase its availability. Agriculture still forms the basis of the rural economy throughout the developing world. There is a need to rework agricultural production systems and move away from current systems that are too dependent on external inputs and oil.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There is a need to focus much more on local and regional conditions. Special attention must be paid to women and their needs, because they account for the majority of small farmers. At the same time, I would like to draw attention to the role of speculators on commodity markets and their contribution to rising food prices and thus to reduced availability of food, which has disastrous results. This amounts to an urgent reason why the Commission ought to focus on regulation of the financial sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report. I believe that agriculture is one of the main policy areas that concerns policy coherence for development and, indeed, where that coherence is usually contradicted.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, we are not feeding the world at the moment, owing to the way that our agricultural policy is designed, and we should not. Food production should happen mostly at local level. We should not try to compete on the global market via our European agricultural policy. We should not focus on competition – quite the opposite: we should enable developing countries to feed themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">What are we doing at the moment, though? Our meat production is 72%-dependent on soya imports – that is around 20 million hectares worth. Overall we export some 40 million hectares worth of our production, but we also import 49 million hectares worth. We are not feeding the world; we are starving it. Our external efforts need to be complemented by internal reforms.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the discussion of a strategic framework for helping developing countries meet the challenges of food security is clearly necessary and welcome; moreover it is inseparable, as the rapporteur rightly points out in her report, from the debate on coherence between this objective of food security in developing countries and the sectoral policies of the European Union, in particular, its agricultural, commercial and energy policies, to name only three.If truth be told, there exists today a flagrant and manifest disjunction between these sectoral policies and said objective of food security. Free trade, the promotion of intensive-production, export-oriented models that are threatening and wrecking small and medium-sized farming and family farming, the use of, and pressure to use, fertile soil for other purposes that compete with food production – all those things threaten the food sovereignty of developing countries, which is in separable from their food security. The greater a country’s food dependence, the greater its food insecurity, and the more difficult it becomes to provide its people with sufficient, good-quality food.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, one of the issues we are considering today is how to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges and, to add to what my colleagues have said, on the one hand, we are designing policies – today we are debating Ms Zimmer’s excellent report, for which we thank her, and we have heard from the Commission about its overall plans and initiatives – while, on the other hand, the Commission issued a communication on 10 May in which it stated that it was considering cutting the countries which enjoy the scheme of generalised tariff preferences by over half.</p>
      <p sl="el">I understand fully the point of that communication and I have examined it. However, I should like the Commission to answer this question: how do these Commission communications fit in with our commitment to increasing aid to developing countries?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, food security is a long term problem in developing countries. Recurrent famines destroy the populations of these countries, and it is mainly women and children that are affected by famine. Of the measures in the report for ensuring basic food security in developing countries, the focus on retaining the rights of local people to hold on to agricultural land is, in my opinion, important.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The massive takeover of land by foreign agricultural investors will lead to growing poverty among the local population, as well as displacement, starvation and uncontrolled migration. Weak and corrupt governments deprive their people of the right to sustenance, access to drinking water and access to food. In my opinion, it is worth considering a resumption of the dialogue on international rules on the acquisition of arable land. The EU, thanks to its humanitarian policies, has a moral right to raise this issue with the international community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Zimmer for her report and all the honourable Members of the Parliament for their interventions on this very important topic. I am very glad that Ms Zimmer welcomes the Commission’s communication on an EU policy framework to assist developing countries in addressing food security challenges from March 2010. I am pleased that she shares many of the policy priorities of the EU policy framework on food security.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may also be aware that the recent public debate on the future of EU development policy has clearly identified agriculture and food and nutrition security as the key areas in which the EU should promote inclusive and green growth. Food and nutrition security remains a top priority for the European Commission, and the Commission remains fully committed to supporting its partners in stepping up investments to achieve food security. We believe that there is much potential to be utilised in developing countries to speed up progress towards the MDGs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Stepping up effort is becoming ever more pressing as we continue to face mounting challenges. The current situation in the Horn of Africa provides the most recent and harrowing justification that now, more than ever, we must act together and provide a response both to the immediate crisis and to longer-term food security in the Horn and worldwide. This is the only way to promote food and nutrition security in a sustainable manner for the most vulnerable populations and to increase their resilience. Agricultural research for development has been a priority as well and it will continue to be one.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to concerns raised in the motion for a resolution regarding the contribution of financial speculation to excessive price volatility, I would like to underline that the Commission is looking into the role of speculation on the level and volatility of food prices. In any event, we must encourage better market transparency in order to contribute to the better functioning of markets and to be able to react quickly and in a coordinated manner. Let me assure you that the Commission is carefully monitoring the situation of rising food prices and the effects on developing and vulnerable economies, and is going to take action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reviews of two important pieces of legislation in financial markets regulation – the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the Market Abuse Directive – are currently underway and the Commission’s proposals are expected this autumn. Measures will be targeted at enhancing the transparency, integrity and stability of financial markets, which also includes agricultural derivatives markets. In addition, food and nutrition assistance should be as efficient and as effective as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has just signed a statement of intent that will enhance cooperation between the Commission and the three Rome-based UN agencies. The Commission also shares the concerns of Parliament that secure access to land and secure land tenure and user rights should not be jeopardised by large-scale land acquisitions. Effective national land policies and laws are essential, requiring governments to take priority action on land. In this regard, the Commission supports the development and application of appropriate land policies and international guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes that sustainable fisheries and aqua-culture also have an important role to play in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. I can assure you that these will remain development cooperation priorities and I am pleased that we share views on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission will be present at the big hearing on food security that Parliament is organising next week.</p>

      <p sl="en">Firstly I would like to raise concern regarding paragraph 63 which calls for the phasing-out of export subsidies and other incentives in the CAP. I will vote against. Many imported agriculture products are non-sustainable and the phasing out of CAP incentives would kill local EU production, which is a stated aim of the rapporteur. It would put EU agriculture at a complete disadvantage. The EU agri-industry must comply with extremely stringent safety regulations; without subsidies we cannot expect the industry to compete with imports and so we would start a race to the bottom of the food chain! I welcome the steps this report takes to highlight food wastage. The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that there were 925 million hungry people in the world in 2010. Meanwhile in Europe about 89 million tonnes of food is wasted every year. That is 179 kg per person! This is a situation which cannot be allowed to continue. Our colossal wastage of food represents our inefficient use and management of food resources; successful commitments to fight poverty and hunger worldwide must begin by addressing our terrible wastage of food. Our right to food must be accompanied with a duty not to waste food.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Zimmer, for an important and excellent report. Nevertheless, I would further underline the role of women as guarantors of food security, because, without these women, many of whom are often smallholder farmers, food security in the developing countries would be in a much worse shape than it is today.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The development of women’s rural businesses faces numerous problems. Women benefit from training, new technologies and help in developing their businesses less frequently than men. Women’s rights to collect debts and own property are not as strong as those of men. The extent to which women participate in decision-making at the local and national level is limited. Although women produce most of the food in developing countries, they own only a fraction of the land. The EU must make much greater use of development assistance for agriculture, not forgetting equality. Agriculture is the largest employer and an effective way to reduce poverty.</p>

      <p sl="fi">At present, we are in the middle of one of the worst food crises in our history. The number of starving people is still at an alarming level, owing to critical drought, speculation on the price of food, and reduced biodiversity. The crisis calls for immediate measures. While we tackle what is an acute problem, however, we must also take the longer-term view.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One problem, about which we still speak all too little, relates to the exploitation of arable land in the developing countries. The unregulated exploitation of arable land has helped reduce opportunities for sustainable development, especially in several African countries. For the EU to establish more sustainable food security in the poorest countries, we need political action that will safeguard the right to work of local people, guarantee the production of adequate supplies of food to meet each country’s needs, reduce corruption, and ensure, while taking environmental considerations into account, that arable land is controlled by a country’s own citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need international norms to strengthen social development. The EU should take an active role, within the context of both its own development cooperation strategy and its multilateral negotiations, to achieve a more sustainable land ownership policy.</p>

    <intervention id="1-218-000" speaker_id="28206" name="Jean-Marie CAVADA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="France" birth_date="24-02-1940" birth_place="Epinal" p_group="Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this somewhat late hour the students are, I trust, sleeping, and it will not be long before their teachers are doing the same. We, however, are still up. Drawing as it does on the Commission’s last report on the European Schools’ system, our report aims to improve the European Schools concept, which must be adapted to the new economic requirements and the changes in society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This concept must remain a model of inspiration for national school systems, promoting European citizenship and encouraging increased mobility, as well as the learning of the languages of the Member States, the languages of the countries of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are the main points of this report: first, it contains a set of policy priorities to improve this educational model in Europe, in particular by establishing an appropriate legal basis for it, in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The current legal status has reached its limits and requires a radical change to allow the Union to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the work of the Member States, without, of course, superseding their competence, and to adopt legally binding acts to that end pursuant to Articles 2 and 6 of the TFEU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that Article 165 of the Treaty could be a perfectly appropriate legal basis. The European Schools must set an educational example by basing themselves on the dissemination of European culture, values, integration and languages. It is, therefore, essential for the Member States to cooperate when developing their national syllabuses, drawing on the simple example, which has worked wonderfully well up to now, of the teaching approach used by the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The opening of Type II and Type III Schools must be wholeheartedly encouraged. It is in this spirit that the report insists that holders of the European baccalaureate should be able, once and for all, to apply to any university in the EU, with the same rights as nationals of the country in question who hold equivalent qualifications, as it is essential that the baccalaureate is automatically recognised in all of the Union’s Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this difficult period, I wished to stress the absolute need to rationalise the Schools’ management costs, without calling into question the fundamental principles on which the concept rests, especially mother-tongue teaching by native speakers, in order to maintain the quality of this teaching. Similarly, I believe it is essential to maintain equal and equivalent teaching conditions for the children of all language communities in the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is, therefore, with a concern for fairness that the report highlights, in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, the plan to see general use of the working languages for teaching all non-fundamental subjects, without, of course, this being detrimental to those whose mother tongue is not one of the working languages.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To ensure good governance of the European Schools, very serious attention must be paid to the lack of seconded staff. This must be compensated for by local recruitment of teachers, whose salaries should be paid by the Schools. The Board of Governors must, therefore, ensure that Member States that do not contribute financially by seconding teachers pay an equivalent financial contribution to the Schools’ budget.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I wished to reaffirm moreover that, in these difficult times in particular, provision for students with special educational needs remains a priority, and I have asked the Board of Governors, in this regard, to ensure that coefficients are applied to this category of student when calculating class sizes in order to ensure their full integration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to repeat my call to the Board of Governors to work on providing alternatives that allow students who are unable to complete the course to find vocational courses. I would not wish to finish this presentation without thanking the Commission, my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs, and especially the parents’ associations, who have enabled us to reach a consensus on which to progress this issue. Forgive me for having stolen 45 seconds from you.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I welcome the discussion on the report drafted by Mr Cavada, in light of the ‘Europeanisation’ of national education systems. This system will facilitate labour mobility in the future, as well as maintaining cultural links with the country of origin. The major benefit of these is mentioned in Article 40. This stipulates the teaching of secondary subjects in the working languages of the European institutions. In addition, creating classes for pupils who speak less common languages removes the communication barriers within this educational methodology.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should emphasise that Romania has initiated reform of the education system in a similar manner. Since 1 September there have been more schools providing teaching in Hungarian, as is the case in Sighet, as well as in Ukrainian, in institutions like the Taras Shevchenko secondary school in Maramureş County. I support the development of the network of European Schools in Member States and the exchange of good practices with national schools.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we must not forget in our work the children living abroad with parents who work in European institutions, in embassies and the like, and who have the option to study in European schools. These schools allow them not only to study in their mother tongue, and thus to maintain the link with home, but also to study other European languages and get a top class European education in a multicultural and multilingual environment.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am opposed to cutting the budget for these schools, but I am rather in favour of looking for new solutions, such as looking for alternative funding sources from the private sector, for example, or accepting the children of parents who work in other international institutions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would also like to call on the Member States to fulfil their financial commitments towards the European schools, and to post teachers who will give tuition in the mother tongue. I would also like to call for 100% recognition of the European Baccalaureate in all Member States, and I call on European universities to adopt a unified approach when assessing secondary school graduates.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Cavada, and the representatives of the European Commission for their excellent cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Schools are a vital facility for over 20 000 children of staff working for EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">They are not a luxury, they simply provide the opportunity for those who are called to live and work abroad in a different cultural environment to access mother-tongue education for their children. I am in favour of the development of the European School model throughout the EU, and not only where European institutions are located. I believe this particular educational system allows pupils to study in a multicultural, multilingual environment while retaining their mother tongue. I am also convinced that this model helps encourage European citizenship and promote mobility within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will conclude by saying that the European School model promotes integration and embodies the spirit of the EU motto, ‘United in Diversity’.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in a Europe where the movement of persons is increasingly dynamic, which also generates a large influx of pupils accompanying their parents to another country, the European School concept must be promoted more at Member State level. The experience of the European Schools in this area should also be utilised more when it comes to producing curricula in European Union Member States, in order to establish the best possible correlation between them and the European Schools system, especially concerning the European Baccalaureate taken at the end of secondary school.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In order to achieve this, I think it would be useful to carry out twinning projects between European Schools and national schools, encourage pupil and teacher exchanges, as well as set up a common EU-level programme aimed at promoting among young people the work of the European Union, its institutions and policies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I agree with most of what has been said. I agree with most of what Ms Băsescu, Ms Neved’alová, Ms Matera and Ms Dăncilă have said, and I would like to thank Mr Cavada for his report. The report contains a number of things that are worthwhile and worth stressing, such as the fact that the report recognises that the Member States are fully responsible for organising their national education systems, as well as what you said, Mr Cavada, that the European school system should allow all subjects to be taught in the pupils’ mother tongue. This is quite important, and is something which should be stressed and to which attention should be drawn.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, my political group will be voting against the report, primarily because it contains are some ideological formulas regarding the constant attempt to create a common European identity, and for this reason the European Conservatives and Reformists Group will be voting against the report.

This is the day that reminds us that the European Union wants multilingualism and multifacetedness and supports diversity and multiculturalism.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is precisely these principles and values that are served by European Schools, which are exemplary education establishments which achieve noteworthy results. These schools are a right, not a luxury, in our unified Europe, offering the children of EU servants and other children an education in their mother tongue. The results achieved by European Schools over the last fifty years speak for themselves. Basically, they offer a new and successful education model. Obviously, we have financial problems here too. However, there is certainly no room for compromise on the right to an education in our mother tongue.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, European schools have an important mission: to provide native-language instruction for pupils whose parents are working outside their country of origin. It is therefore with great concern that we view attempts, on the pretext of cost efficiency, to implement measures that could well put the mission and objective of European schools at risk.We are speaking of measures such as increasing the minimum class size for elective subjects, the vertical merger of two or more different years into a single class, or the reduction of support for pupils with learning difficulties. Some of these measures could well give rise to situations that in the past were considered unfairly discriminatory by the European Ombudsman.We reject any step backward in this area. It is furthermore unacceptable that in European schools the principle of multilingualism is being attacked and that the privileged status enjoyed by some of the languages of the European Union in other domains is being extended in this case to the detriment of the rest.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, it is not only the European Union’s constant enlargement and the increasing number of officials whose children attend the European schools, but also the need to be more cost-effective in light of the economic crisis which have made it necessary to review this education system.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Adapting the curriculum to national education systems, for example, may facilitate the rapid integration of pupils on their return to their country of origin. The financial constraints must also be offset by the principle of learning subjects in the mother tongue, including languages spoken by a smaller number of citizens, thereby helping reinforce a common European identity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, including a course in the curriculum devoted to EU integration may help raise awareness about European citizenship right from a young age. It is also just as important to clarify the legal status of these schools and for Member States to assume full responsibility for managing this area by providing sufficient funding and for seconding the requested teaching staff. I would like to thank and congratulate Mr Cavada.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the EU created the European school system for children of employees of European institutions, making it possible for the children to get an education in their mother tongue at the location where the European institutions are situated. As a result of the EU’s recruitment policy, there has been a constant increase in the number of pupils of these schools, and in connection with this it has been difficult to ensure a sufficient number of qualified teachers and language assistants.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Since there is no effective mechanism for enforcing the commitments taken on by Member States when these schools were established, some Member States are failing to fill positions with their posted teachers, and school managers must therefore improvise and replace the missing teachers with language assistants who do not always have adequate qualifications. It would therefore be a good idea to complete the rules on the functioning of European schools so that they are capable of fulfilling their mission, as the parents rightly expect. If the Union now needs to make savings, let it save rather on museums or trips to Strasbourg, but not on the education of its children.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the mobility of EU employees, who naturally relocate together with their children, is a feature of European Union life. It is important for everyone to receive an education in their mother tongue, and the European schools are unique in this sense, performing a praiseworthy activity. It is also important and at the same time pleasing that the European Schools serve as a fine pedagogical model for other types of school.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I fully support the expansion of the European school model. It is one way of developing a common European identity from an early age. In this sense, I would like to call for European schools and their expansion to be afforded appropriate conditions, whether political, bureaucratic or financial. An educated nation - an educated society - means better jobs, better quality of life and higher living standards. It is also important to ensure that pupils and students at all types of schools receive high quality information, including information that will enhance their European awareness, providing a sound foundation for a common European prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Cavada for his report as well as for his remarkable cooperation and his support for European schools. This really is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am very glad that almost all the speakers today support the European Schools system. It is very important for me and for the Commission, and I am sure it is very important for the European Schools, because Parliament is a legislator. Its voice will be very important when we discuss budgetary and other issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Parliament will be well aware that the European Schools are of high importance to me and to the whole Commission. I fully agree with Mr Cavada when he argues in his report that the European Schools cannot be considered elitist and a luxury, rather than a necessity. They are essential for the European institutions and fundamental for a smooth-functioning public service with a large number of expatriate staff from all over Europe. The Commission welcomes this report on the European School system and is in full agreement with its main orientations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, let me mention the opening-up of the system and the European Baccalaureate. The Commission fully supports the extension of the European curriculum in the Member States via the pedagogical accreditation of national schools with a view to developing a European Forum for Schooling and improving professional mobility. In fact, pupils who have spent all or part of their school lives in the multicultural and multilingual environment which the European schools provide begin their working life with an enormous advantage. The holders of the European Baccalaureate go on to study all over Europe. Their openness towards others and their ability to adapt to new environments single them out. This should also be the foundation stone of their future development as European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last May, I went to the Council to remind the Member States of this opportunity, and I recently wrote a letter to the ministers for education to encourage them to open up their national systems. The Commission also agrees that the system is currently experiencing some structural shortcomings, and has been for some time. We have to face several challenges in the near future concerning the governance of the system, the infrastructure to be provided by the host Member States, the secondment of teachers by some Member States, the budgetary constraint of the EU budget contribution, and so on. These difficulties can pose serious problems to some schools and parents. I am fully aware of that but we, together with the Member States, and you, the Members of the European Parliament, have to address those questions and find the best practical answers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Concerning the governance system, the Commission emphasises the need for a solution to the existing deficiencies, but bears in mind that a change to the intergovernmental structure was proposed during the last reform process and was unanimously rejected by the Member States during the negotiations. With the recent experience of the Member States’ reaction to the concept of reform of the governance aspects, and in particular the intergovernmental structure, the Commission is hesitant to reopen a fundamental debate with the Member States on this issue, which could be very long and far from a guarantee for a constructive solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is convinced that the necessary adjustment, notably giving the EU institutions a weight corresponding to their financial contribution, can be made within the framework of the existing Convention, even though this depends on the Member States’ commitment and goodwill, as well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To give another example, under the current Convention, Member States which contribute less to the system than their quota of seconded teachers in relation to the number of national pupils can compensate for their deficit by way of a financial contribution. In the letter I recently sent to the Member States’ education ministers, I drew the attention of those concerned to the obligation stemming from the agreement on the European Schools.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also mentions alternative means of financing that could be explored. The Commission agrees that this is an option to take into account. For example, we could take inspiration from the arrangements made by the European School in Karlsruhe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the general budget of the European Schools is concerned, the Commission has intensively supported solutions that are cost-efficient in order to keep the evolution of the budget under control. These include adapting seconded teachers’ salaries along the lines followed for the staff of the EU institutions in the 2004 reform and rationalising the practical organisation of studies within the schools, which was decided by the Board of Governors in April of this year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It remains the Commission’s clear priority that the core curriculum should not be affected by these rationalisation measures. As is mentioned in the report, the Commission fully agrees that the quality of education must be safeguarded. It absolutely essential for the pupils to receive the education required for access to higher education after the European Baccalaureate. As far as pedagogical methods are concerned, the Commission fully agrees with the rapporteur that the European Baccalaureate must be recognised in all Member States and that the pupils must be treated under the same conditions as nationals of each country. The Commission is following this process very closely.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also mentions the importance of the support given to pupils with special educational needs, the so-called SEN pupils. Indeed, everything should be done to help SEN children to follow the curriculum as far as they can be integrated in the European Schools, while bearing in mind that the European Schools are ordinary schools and not specialised schools.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the current context, I am very much in favour of the idea of an external evaluation of the Schools’ pedagogical performances. The best way to do that is to use the PISA study, which the OECD has been carrying out for many years. I am glad to say that one European School – the one in Luxembourg – is already involved, with brilliant results. All the European Schools should participate in this evaluation. The Secretary-General and the Directors agree that this approach is the most efficient way to make an evaluation. The Commission proposed this last June. It should be discussed this autumn so that the Board of Governors can take a decision in December.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I would like to thank you for showing an active interest in the European School system and in the future educational possibilities of more than 22 000 pupils and, hopefully soon, of even more European pupils.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a late hour this evening, we are debating a subject that is of absolutely crucial importance for us. In any case, 37% of the EU budget goes on cohesion policy. Let us take a closer look – today, in the middle of the period, in 2011 – at how much in the way of resources has actually been taken from the Structural and Cohesion Funds so far. We can see that, unfortunately, in many Member States, the absorption rate and absorption capacity are well below what should actually have been paid out already by this stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have new Members States, such as Bulgaria and Romania, which have a poor absorption rate, but it is not only the new Member States; there are also Member States that have been in the Union for a long time, with regions such as Calabria and Sicily in the founder State of Italy, that with a rate of 7% – if we are to believe the budgetary controllers in the Committee on Budgetary Control – are well behind. This raises the question: why are these regions unable to spend the financial resources that we make available?</p>
      <p sl="de">There is Greece, too. Here in Parliament we have been highlighting where action is needed for months and have been pointing out that a country like Greece is not absorbing these resources, and we are pleased that the Commission, which to start with did not attach the necessary importance to this matter, has now given it high priority. With regard to Greece in particular, President Barroso has pointed out that, out of 20 billion, 15 billion has not been spent, and Commissioner Hahn has also just been there. We have considered what we can do to help these regions. The first thing to consider, as always, is the subject of cofinancing. The fact is that the regions are finding it difficult, in this global economic crisis, to finance their own share and Member States like Greece, which appear to be on the brink of insolvency, are also finding it difficult to finance their own share. There is no question that help must be provided here. However, it is clearly not just a matter of cofinancing, because there are also regions in Greece that really do not want an increase in European Union subsidies, are happy with the current rate of 80% and would rather implement more projects. Thus, it is not just a question of cofinancing; there are many different reasons. The procedures are too complex and need to be simplified as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is also the problem that, in many Member States, the central administrations of the governments in the capital cities take too long and the regions and regional authorities at local level have insufficient decision-making options in order to use the resources. Take Romania, for example, where the local authorities take 20 to 30 days to process applications, the regional authorities take around 60 days, but the central government takes 260 days. All of this provides an argument for delegating responsibility from the top down and introducing a strong local self-administration.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where are the Council, the Council Presidency and Mr van Rompuy this evening, in fact? He has taken the floor with regard to other matters. We are talking about 37% of the EU budget here. The EU is putting off payment obligations of EUR 250 billion. How are they to be fulfilled? The President-in-Office of the Council from Poland could have attempted to answer this, as Poland, of course, has shown how the absorption rate can be increased. There are also examples of good governance. Poland has managed it – its absorption capacities have increased – but so has Estonia.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Parliament, we are of the opinion that the Member States are now called on to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that the resources that we as Parliament have made available for the citizens in the regions are actually spent, also in the interests of increasing competitiveness and stabilisation of jobs and employment. In this regard, we expect the Commission to push forward with the method adopted and to very strongly urge the Member States to bring this matter to a positive conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the subject we are discussing is crucial, even at this late hour. Absorption of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund must be optimised in order to maximise the contribution of the available regional policy resources to social and economic cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the aim of absorbing as much financial support as possible requires continuous efforts from Member States, and it is vital that local and regional levels of administration are involved at every stage of the process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The rules relating to these funds are complex and therefore difficult to transpose into national law and comply with. This may create problems, and Member States and regions have to spend an excessive amount of time trying to manage and control them. The rules and procedures need to be simpler and more flexible at both EU and national level in order to facilitate access to EU funds and promote sound management of these funds by the administrative services, without creating major difficulties for the beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This simplification must contribute to the speedy allocation of funds, higher absorption rates, increased efficiency and transparency, fewer implementation errors and reduced payment periods. The proposals in future framework documents and operational programmes must address the needs of the relevant actors as effectively as possible.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Union’s regional policy enables it to reduce regional disparities, stimulate development and create jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Member States’ absorption rates for EU funds vary. Romania has a very low absorption rate, but this situation must not lead to a reduction in the EU funds which Romania can have access to and needs during the 2014-2020 period. The prerequisites for increasing the absorption of EU funds are the timely adoption of the multiannual financial framework, greater flexibility in organising operational programmes, and preparing and adopting them in good time. We feel that the EU funds allocated to developing the energy infrastructure and devising energy efficiency measures for residential buildings need to be increased.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Commission will allocate EUR 10 billion from the Cohesion Fund for the 2014-2020 period, targeted at the transport infrastructure in the countries below the convergence criterion.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to begin by welcoming the establishment in Romania last week of the Ministry of European Funds, which will coordinate the management of these funds in the administrative system. Romania and Bulgaria are currently in a difficult situation regarding the absorption of funds, particularly to do with environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should stress that in June this year the European Commission stopped the payments for Axis 2 of the regional operational programme for our country. The Commission report refers in particular to the shortcomings noted in the public procurement system used for distributing them. In light of the current crisis, these funds provide a guarantee against the economic imbalances originating from the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the way in which Structural Funds are absorbed can also be improved through regional cooperation between neighbouring states. Taking into account the drafting of the multiannual financial perspective, 2012 is crucial to the implementation phase of the projects financed by European funds.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the disbursement of financial resources from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund is still causing problems, as it has to many countries in the past. The complexity of the rules and conditions that must be fulfilled, as well as the number of errors, lead to undesirable consequences. The time spent on checking and administering the funds is disproportionate. It is therefore necessary to find a balance, a fair balance between simplification of the rules and procedures and their stability.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Another important point to focus on is the distinction between the individual forms of non-fulfilment of conditions for the disbursement of funds. I would like to call for the differentiation of formal errors, for example, according to their gravity. The aim of fund administrators should not be to punish but to find ways of cooperating with beneficiaries to eliminate any formal deficiencies caused by inattention or a shortage of personnel.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The disbursement of funds for addressing the Roma issue is a whole separate chapter. I would also like to call for the preparation of such funding to be viewed from a totally new perspective.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We certainly must acknowledge that Romania still has a problem, at the moment, with absorbing European funds. This is precisely why the government has taken a whole series of measures which culminated, as has already been mentioned, in establishing the new Ministry of European Affairs, with former EU commissioner Leonard Orban as minister.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The projects at the outset were small and low-value, but now the measures adopted are starting to take effect. There is an ever-increasing number of high-value, in fact, very high-value projects which are appearing. I only need to mention that today the European Commission advised that funding has been approved for two transport projects amounting to EUR 724 million. I repeat, for just two transport projects involving motorways.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, an effective EU cohesion policy is a prerequisite for the harmonious development of all regions of the EU, by helping to reduce economic, social and geographical inequalities. The ability to draw down resources, or in other words to make effective use of resources allocated from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion fund, varies from region to region. Unfortunately, the most disadvantaged regions, which need the funds the most, often lag behind in spending, because they lack the minimum financial resources necessary for cofinancing, as well as the human resources and administrative support.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The administrative and institutional resources of the public sector at national, regional and local level must be increased in a targeted way. The competent bodies should also consider new processes for boosting the qualifications of their employees.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to end by saying that many countries have displayed an ability to draw down European funding much more effectively than in the past. My own country is an example of this, as it is drawing down funds much more effectively than it did when the previous government was in power.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first I would like to thank Mr Theurer for his report and for putting this very important topic on the agenda. I think that we really need to discuss these issues in great detail because they are very important and they will be even more important in the framework of the forthcoming discussions on the details and the future of the MFF. We would also like to welcome this report because we see it as a very important contribution from Parliament to the debate on absorption capacity as a very important part of the Commission’s policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also very pleased that the report refers to absorption capacity using the broader approach to, and broader concept of, absorption which goes beyond a purely financial notion and also includes effectiveness and good management of funds. Implementation of projects without jeopardising the effectiveness of resources is a very important issue which is challenging for some Member States, as we could hear in this discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes that there exists an important common ground in the analyses of the absorption problems between Parliament and the Commission. The Commission has shown in the current discussion its willingness to provide available absorption data, although some of these data depend on the information provided by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We share the concerns in the report on the delays in absorption in some Member States in particular and reasons for this, notably difficulties in adoption of compliance assessments and the parallel implementation of the programming periods of 2000, 2006, 2007 and 2013. We can say, however, that absorption has accelerated, particularly in the last year, and our latest figures show that the absorption rate stands at 29.2%. These show that the absorption of structural funds has accelerated and is currently in a good place.</p>
      <p sl="en">But judging from all the speakers we have heard this evening, I think it is quite clear that we need to learn a lesson from the current period and we need to improve the way in which the rules are set out for future spending in this area. Therefore, whilst we are currently preparing the proposals for the regulation for the period 2014-2020 we are going to take all these lessons into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">These proposals, therefore, will incorporate the results of the analyses which we have just been discussing and a very important part of this will be the push and pressure for simplification of the procedures and a reduction in gold-plating, both at EU and national level. Here, we very much need your support because gold-plating always occurs at the final stages of the legislative process, be it at EU level or very often at national level as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also encourage the Member States to boost administrative capacity and to increase the efficiency of their public administrations because, from what we can see in some of the Member States, it is clear that the levels of administrative capability and capacity have direct consequences on the ability to absorb the funds efficiently and on time. We have therefore come up with the idea of improvement to the partnership and multi-level governance which, we believe, would set out the conditions for closer cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and will provide an essential improvement and contribute to better management of funds in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">In reply to Monika Flašíková-Beňová, concerning the absorption funds for Roma inclusion, I would say that here, we in the Commission are waiting anxiously for the national programmes and national strategies which should be sent to the Commission before the end of the year and I believe that once this is done we can evaluate them and have a wide discussion on how EU funds are used in the very important issue of Roma inclusion.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the experience that was drawn on during the current programming period regarding the absorption of Cohesion Policy funds. The rapporteur, in my opinion, very correctly describes the three basic shortcomings of Cohesion Policy beneficiaries. These include a lack of financial resources for cofinancing, a lack of human resources and a lack of the administrative support required to make good use of the available resources. The rapporteur quite correctly points out the difficulties that accompany the start of each new programming period, when there are problems implementing management and control systems, usually as a result of delays in the development and implementation of EU and Member State rules or associated guidelines, and incomplete or imprecise rules for the absorption of Cohesion Policy funds. The problems are very often caused by insufficient separation between the authorities in the Member States, hierarchy problems with the institutions and internal difficulties over the allocation of tasks and responsibilities. I personally consider it very important that the rapporteur points out the need for a stronger focus on punishing fraud rather than punishing formal irregularities. Finally, I would like to highlight the paramount importance of timely adoption of the multiannual financial framework and of clear and definitive rules and guidance for the Member States. The experiences listed in the report are also highly relevant for the Czech Republic.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As you are aware, regional policy accounts for 35.7% of the EU’s budget. It is a substantial budget, but it is necessary for the development and growth of our regions. In this period of economic and financial crisis, we bear a heavy responsibility, that of guaranteeing to our citizens that the money that they entrust to Europe is used for ambitious projects that promote growth. We have seen an improvement in the absorption of cohesion policy funds for the period 2007-2013, and we must continue to encourage these efforts. However, the absorption rates in some regions and some Member States of the EU continue to be low. That is why we must collectively strive to take all of the measures required to reverse this trend. EU procedures and rules already exist and work well. We must now simplify them in order to overcome the administrative burdens and enable small project organisers to access EU funds. Improving absorption capacity is a concern that we will have to take into account during the negotiations on the next financial perspective if we wish to ensure a return to growth in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I was pleased to see the European Commission’s proposal setting the absorption capacity for European funds by any one country at 2.5% of GDP. There are still many Member States which qualify for the first convergence target. Access to EU funds will permit faster development of these regions, greater innovation and what this entails in being better able to withstand the recession with which the whole world is now grappling. The decision to concentrate funds on a smaller number of priorities and to monitor their use more efficiently are excellent ideas, as is the idea to reward Member States and regions which best implement the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy. This will certainly motivate Member States to make more considered and effective decisions on spending money from the Structural and Cohesion Funds. I am also pleased that attention has been drawn to more efficient use of the European Social Fund, as the money is meant to be spent on effective programmes which will allow the beneficiaries of the projects concerned to find work. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="el">May I start by congratulating the rapporteur on a very important report. The low absorption rate of cohesion policy funds translates in practice into untapped development opportunities for the regions. Today, when most Member States are under considerable fiscal pressure, prompt and proper absorption of the considerable cohesion policy resources available to each region could drive growth and cohesion, not only at national level, but also overall, at EU level. Luckily, we are now in a position to understand most of the main reasons that prevent regional authorities from making proper use of these funds. These reasons are set out in detail in the report. I should therefore like to welcome the initiatives and effort on the part of the Commission to provide technical support to bodies with inadequate administrative capacity and assistance for Member States with insufficient resources, due to the crisis, to cofinance projects. The European Parliament has shown that it is prepared to support any effort designed to simplify the rules and strike a balance between funds and efforts and audits and results, a differentiated approach to fraud and irregularities and the provision of technical support to bodies with insufficient administrative capacity.</p>
