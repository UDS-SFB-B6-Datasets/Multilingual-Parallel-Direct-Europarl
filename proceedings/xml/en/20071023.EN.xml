      <p sl="de">Mr President, I should like to come back to a decision that was made yesterday afternoon. However, I must put on record that neither the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, nor the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, or any of the other groups were informed about the wish for us to adopt a resolution on Russia this time, even though this has been repeatedly rejected in the Conference of Presidents.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must, of course, take note of the decision. However, I should like to record here – and we shall also inform the groups that have requested this, particularly the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – that we are not asking for this resolution to be adopted now, but at Parliament’s next sitting instead. I should simply like to record this here.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must, of course, formally abide by the rules. However, we do want to say here, out of fairness to the Greens and Liberals, that we are asking for this resolution to be adopted not this week, but at the next plenary session. The Socialist Group will be voting on it in any case and I believe the EPP has a similar idea.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0391/2007) by Sahra Wagenknecht, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy (2007/2097(INI)).</p>

    <intervention id="2-014" speaker_id="28250" name="Sahra Wagenknecht" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question as to whether the Member States’ taxation policy actually helps to promote growth, employment and innovation at present can unfortunately be answered in very few words: it does not! Growth is simply not promoted by abandoning to free fall the tax rates of highly profitable conglomerates in a Europe-wide dumping race and in return demanding cash increasingly forcefully from average wage earners, the unemployed and pensioners in their capacity as consumers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Growth is not promoted by subjecting income from employment to a tax rate that is several times greater than that applied to income from assets, thereby making the gap between them ever wider. Employment is not promoted when small investing enterprises are taxed disproportionately more than those tinkering speculatively in shares, bonds and financial derivatives. Innovation is certainly not promoted as long as multinationals with gilt-edged balance sheets are able to stash away the best part of research and development funds in their accounts, while those who are actually targeted for this kind of benefit are left out in the rain.</p>
      <p sl="de">In brief: a socially balanced perspective and development is certainly not being promoted in the EU, but is virtually being stalled while those rolling in money are being treated to more and more tax breaks and fattened up even more while those who already have little are having to dig ever deeper into their pockets. This kind of taxation policy is fatal in terms of economic policy, counterproductive in terms of growth policy and catastrophic in terms of social policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I know that the structure of national taxation systems still lies, of course, within the sovereignty of the Member States on paper, but the reality is somewhat different. The lack of EU-wide coordination actually means – even in the direct taxation sector – that national taxation systems are increasingly no longer designed at all on the basis of policy, but are formed and moulded by the ice-cold system of tax competition. This system can involve a simple denominator: the more mobile a factor, the greater its potential for extortion against national fiscal services and the more sweeping the tax relief, of course, which it is able to enforce itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">If government revenues are not to dry up and run out completely in this process, the sectors not able to escape taxation at all, or only with difficulty, must be taxed even more heavily almost as compensation. Taxes are therefore shifted – from corporate profits to private income, and then from investment income to labour income, which is even less mobile, within income from highly paid employment to less well paid employees, who are also correspondingly less mobile, and generally from income and assets to consumption. The fact that this process is in force – and has been for years and decades – can be very clearly demonstrated by the data on tax receipts and taxation rates in the EU. Not only the legal tax rates but also the actual tax rates on corporate profits in the EU have fallen in the last decade by over 10 percentage points. All the studies carried out on this subject confirm this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The highest tax rates have been reduced virtually everywhere in the EU Member States. In more and more Member States private investment income is given much greater preference over income from employment because of the transfer to dual tax systems. Excise duty is increasing ever further – on the one hand because of ‘eco-taxes’, which often enough have no ecological steering effect at all even in the absence of alternatives, but which quite frankly fleece budgets, and on the other hand because of the fact that value added taxes are constantly increasing and in more and more countries are approaching the top end of the agreed range.</p>
      <p sl="de">Such a development is no accident. It is the direct result of unchecked tax competition on a uniform internal market. It should already be leading us to believe that the upward trend of corporate taxes within the EU is broadly eclipsing those in the whole of the OECD. This means that tax rates here have clearly fallen more than in the OECD as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="de">This also clearly shows that the many pressures of globalisation much and happily complained about are not taking effect here, but that there are home-made pressures created within the EU and therefore also pressures that could very easily be discreetly overcome if there was a desire to do so. Very appropriately my original report included the call not only for a common consolidated corporate tax base, which it does, of course, support, but also for EU-wide minimum tax rates on corporate profits, which should no longer be exceeded by any country thereafter. Only minimum tax rates of this kind actually offer the opportunity to stop the upward trend in corporate taxes somewhere along the way.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report included the call for stronger EU-wide taxation of assets and financial transactions, the call to relieve labour income explicitly in the lower and middle classes and finally the call to reverse the fatal trend of transferring direct taxes increasingly to indirect taxes and reinstigate the counter-trend.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only a fraction of all these calls have unfortunately been retained after the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Instead, my report bursts into a song of praise for tax competition in complete ignorance of the fatal consequences of this supposedly healthy tax competition for the revenue side of EU budgets and therefore for the situations in which millions of Europeans also find themselves. Such changes made to the report unfortunately show very clearly whose interests are in fact close to the heart of the majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and especially those of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, because it is very obvious who profits from the prevailing tax regimes in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have now once again put forward our most important requests as amendments in plenary. Should they fail to secure a majority there too, my group will vote against the report. Another taxation policy in the EU that minimises the social contrasts instead of constantly reinforcing them – as the present taxation policy does – would indeed be possible and would be demanded as a matter of urgency. This would, however, imply that the prevailing policy in the European Commission and also in the individual Member States does in fact consist of considering the interests of the majority of Europeans according to their guiding principle, instead of serving as they have done to date as executors of the interests of the élite of society. It will simply give rise to even greater parliamentary and extra-parliamentary pressure.</p>
      <p sl="de">We shall continue to strive precisely against this pressure so that eventually the inexpressible rhetoric of socially intolerable relationships – which characterises most reports and which also now characterises this report on taxation – is no longer capable of winning a majority in this House either.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am really pleased to be able to discuss with you the contribution of taxation and customs policy to the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">A major priority of the European Union is to improve its competitiveness while preserving its social model. Taxation policy has a major role to play in helping to achieve growth and employment objectives. I welcome the essential message of your report, which is one of support for the Commission’s initiatives in the tax area. In particular, it encourages increased efforts concerning the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), the home state taxation pilot scheme proposal, the strategy ensuring better coordination of Member States’ tax systems particularly in the field of exit taxation and cross-border loss relief, the work undertaken by the joint transfer pricing forum, the strategy to combat tax fraud, the VAT package, the reduced VAT rates on labour intensive services and environmental taxation.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these files are extremely important. They are the core of the Commission’s approach to tax policy and many of them have been discussed in several committees of the European Parliament. It is clear that European companies deserve a system of corporate taxation adapted to the degree of their actual and potential economic integration at the scale of their cross-border activities in Europe. This is one of the keys to their future competitiveness. It is also essential that other direct tax obstacles find a solution by coordination and not only through costly litigation.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is only one area where I cannot follow you. This is in paragraph 17 of the Wagenknecht report, as it stands now, where it asks for the suppression of minimum rates for excise duties and the replacement of current Community legislation in this domain by a code of conduct. We discussed these elements in this House when dealing with the proposal on alcohol taxation and, with all due respect, I have got to say that the Commission has not changed its mind.</p>
      <p sl="en">Community legislation on excise duties in general has an important role to play in order to reduce distortion in the internal market, to protect public health and to gear consumption patterns towards more environmentally sustainable behaviour. The Commission strongly believes that minimum rates are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market by providing a safety net for Member States which ensures that all Member States actually apply excise duties and that the levels are meaningful. I hope that the tabled amendment which aims at changing paragraph 17 will be endorsed by a majority of Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude with three messages. Firstly, you all know that my services are working very hard to table a legislative proposal on the CCCTB which I intend to present to you after the summer break in 2008. Secondly, in the VAT field, the Commission fully supports the Portuguese Presidency in its efforts to reach agreement on the VAT package and also to advance substantially the broader debate on VAT rates before the end of the year. We can also work to ensure adoption of the proposal for prolonging certain derogations in new Member States on reduced VAT rates. In addition, we will continue our intense efforts to combat VAT fraud and we will soon come forward with a proposal on the VAT treatment of financial services that will provide the sector with more legal certainty and with modernised rules. Thirdly, we remain committed to a system of minimum rates in excise duties in order to reduce distortion and to promote fair competition in the internal market to contribute to the protection of public health and to the environment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, sometimes, in this Chamber, we cannot really see the political differences between groups, but, on this issue, the difference is very visible, because I could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned. I respect the work she has done on this report, but on this issue we have totally different views on what should be done by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, this report is about the Lisbon Strategy and what we should do to restore Europe’s global competitiveness. This is really the only way to guarantee European welfare and the welfare of our citizens. Without taxation, this is impossible. Taxation has a crucial role to play in this respect, in bringing competitiveness to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must remember that overall tax levels in Europe are still above the OECD average. In order to achieve a lower level of taxation in Europe, we need to create an environment conducive to investment. We need more investments, more growth, and more, flourishing businesses in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Healthy tax competition has a beneficial role in this respect. This is an economic, market-based control mechanism against rampant political decisions. If we have fruitful tax competition in Europe, governments cannot put obstacles in the way of the single market. That is what we want: a genuine single market without tax-made obstacles. On the other hand, there is no evidence that fruitful tax competition would erode tax bases. The total tax revenue has remained remarkably stable, thanks to increased economic activity.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the existence of 27 different tax regimes creates problems, particularly for European SMEs, which are so important to this growth. According to a 2004 EC taxation survey, compliance for small SMEs costs about 2.6% of their sales and 31% of taxes paid. So, one third of all the tax goes to compliance. The high proportionate amount of tax compliance for small companies is a big obstacle, and that is why we need to do our best to call for cross-border loss relief, simplified customs procedures, one-stop-shop schemes for VAT, home states taxation pilot projects and so on. We support everything that the Commission has done in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, industry wishes to see a well-managed and simple tax administration system. We need to resolve the problems of transfer pricing, loss offsetting EU-wide and avoiding double taxation, and to lower our compliance costs. We welcome the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) proposal, and the fact that the Commission is stable and brings us the proposal on CCCTB, because loss-relief is only a temporary thing. In the end, we need a consolidated corporate tax base.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Wagenknecht had the initiative to draft a report, which is proof of the political courage it took to highlight the redistributive and social dimension of taxation policy. This document is one of the more important pieces of evidence showing that the debate on taxation policy may become Europe-wide.</p>
      <p sl="el">The commitment to meet the Lisbon targets, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, the obligation to administer and redistribute tax revenue so that it meets cohesion and employment objectives, and the completion of the internal market - all these are proof enough of a political aim. The taxation policies of Member States can no longer be based exclusively and solely on national criteria: dialogue on taxation is becoming necessary to promote greater tax coordination throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="el">Given such a dialogue, which has enabled substantial cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups, we have concentrated on the following fundamental points. Firstly, on the issue of tax competition, we do not believe that the object ought to be to curb the principle of tax competition, for this would be tantamount to censuring the policies of certain Member States. Owing to the lack of common rules on tax policy issues, tax competition with its offers and counter-offers of low tax rates creates problems. As is also the case for the other sectors of the internal market, however, tax competition can ensure competitiveness and improve the productivity of national economies, as well as that of Europe as a whole, provided that the rules curbing the growth of harmful competition obtain.</p>
      <p sl="el">The second point we focused on was the relation between direct and indirect taxation. A trend has recently been noticed in Member States to increase indirect taxation, in most cases to cover their fiscal deficits. This is a burden for consumers, however, and the market remains unmonitored.</p>
      <p sl="el">The aim of this report is to find safety measures facilitating a balanced combination of direct and indirect taxes. We are in favour of a revision of the system of VAT and special consumption taxes. This should not mean that it is replaced by a code of conduct not binding on all the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, we are aware of the efforts of the Commission and the problems at Ecofin. Nonetheless, we as members of the European Parliament must above all closely cooperate with national parliaments to debate this major fiscal policy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would also like to stress the importance of this report as the strategic line we should follow in making reforms in the economies of the European Union. Regretfully, the representatives of Portugal are not with us today, when we are discussing this very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="lt">What are the main points of our report? The main point is that in view of changes in the economic environment we must carry out an overhaul not only of our plants and enterprises, but also of the instruments of our fiscal policy. When referring to the Lisbon Strategy, we usually speak about expenditure policy; very rarely do we consider taxation policy. Without paying due attention to taxation policy we would not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives.</p>
      <p sl="lt">What issues are to be considered? First of all, it is necessary to look into the ways of distributing the tax burden between the producer and the consumer. Moreover, we cannot ignore the fact that there is one more group of people – those living on capital income. This is known as private equity.</p>
      <p sl="lt">How do we distribute the tax burden? This is one of the challenges presented by the new economic environment. Another very important question is: how do we encourage structural reforms? Structural reforms cannot be implemented without introducing new enterprises, as people are not able to leave their existing jobs for new work places, which could create grounds for social discontent. New enterprises can be created only with beneficial taxation conditions. This is one of the main points of our document.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The issue that needs to be considered is: what level of tax policy coordination is needed among the Member States? We are in favour of competitive taxes and we do not support the idea of introducing minimum rates. This is because each country has its own specific economic structure and national expenditure policy. Taxation policy must be in line with expenditure policy, but we are definitely in favour of the coordination of tax base policy and support the Commission on that matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I emphatically agree with Mrs Kauppi. The disagreements between the groups here in the European Parliament on the subject of taxation policy are becoming clearer and clearer. We must give this debate much more serious attention over the next few months. I should like to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteur for the significant effort they have made in order to bring this report to a good conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="de">A good conclusion – but not for us. As a Group we shall not be able to accept this report in its final form. It has some pleasant aspects, for example it describes and demands the important step towards a consolidated tax base for corporate taxes. This is an important first step. However, this must be accompanied by similarly clear declarations as regards harmonising minimum tax rates, because otherwise it will lead to unchecked tax competition, specifically in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also see problems under Article 17, where the committee has unfortunately clearly stated that it is against minimum tax rates for excise duty. This, too, is unfortunately in line with the votes of recent weeks and we greatly regret this. We support the group here. We believe that we have to achieve harmonisation in European excise duty and that this harmonisation must be strengthened, if anything, because otherwise we will have unchecked tax competition in excise duty.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also think it is a problem that far too little is being said on the subjects of climate change and eco-taxes. I, too, wish to disagree with the rapporteur here. I believe that eco-taxes are an important instrument for meeting these challenges of climate change. We have to do much more in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do, however, think that the approach of focussing on nuclear energy here, or on ‘clean’ forms of energy, is wrong. It is important that we focus clearly on energy saving and energy efficiency. These are the important answers. When we look at the challenges facing us in the refurbishment of buildings and in the field of transport, it seems that we can genuinely meet the Kyoto aim of energy saving if a great deal more is done here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tax policy can make an important contribution to achieving greater energy savings and, greater energy efficiency and to genuinely meeting the challenges of climate change. Unfortunately, this report does not reflect this position. As I have already announced, we shall therefore not be voting in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, our group endorses Mrs Wagenknecht’s views in this matter, even if they are in conflict with the opinions of the majority on the Committee.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The European Union will not be the world’s leading knowledge- and technology-based economy in 2010. It is not, however, due to tax systems, which have continually been reformed in ways that favour big companies, that the target under the Lisbon Strategy is unrealisable. Big companies choose transfer pricing and finding of a home for their capital as options enabling them to avoid tax. In this they are aided by the tax havens and offshore financial centres operating in the Member States of the EU, both blots on the EU’s moral landscape.</p>
      <p sl="fi">According to the rapporteur, the Commission in its communication does not consider the effects of taxation on income distribution. The system of flat tax which some Member States apply favours those on large incomes, while progressive income tax promotes social equality. The Lisbon Strategy cannot be implemented in a manner which would eat away at the financial basis of the welfare society and which would be grossly unfair.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it says this is a contribution, but it is more like a recipe, a recipe for the harmonisation of yet more taxation, which I quote here and there from the report: ‘27 different tax systems’ are an ‘impediment’; ‘coordination of Member States’ fiscal policy’; ‘calls on the Member States to … ensure greater fairness in the distribution of the tax burden’; ‘supports’ the Commission in gearing ‘fiscal policy towards … environmental objectives’; ‘increase in fuel taxes’; ‘establish a pan-European … corporate tax base’. In short, it is back to the failed policies of the 1970s.</p>
      <p sl="de">In any case, even the British cannot get it right for all of our country. North is not the same as the south, Wales and Scotland are different to the south-east – and that was under Gordon Brown as Chancellor for 10 years. Surely you listened to him; after all, you did at Lisbon last week when, as Prime Minister, you let him keep the red lines, did you not? Or did you?</p>
      <p sl="de">Later in the report, it talks about ‘EU-wide coordination’ of ‘direct taxation’. In the UK, we thought we had been promised that harmonised taxes, especially income tax, would never come. Now, here it is in a report. It is a bit like the Reform Treaty. Gordon Brown keeps on saying it is not a constitution, when all the EU leaders say it is: Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Angela Merkel, even our own President of President said so in this Chamber a short while ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">So why do you not get Gordon Brown to tell the truth to the British people? Harmonise that message! Now, that is harmonisation I would go along with. But you dare not do that to the British people because, when they are told the plain unvarnished truth, they will vote with their feet, right out of the EU, taking their annual EU contributions of EUR 18 billion of their own taxpayers’ money with them. What price harmonised taxes then?</p>

      <p sl="ro">The importance of reviewing the contribution that the fiscal and customs policies could bring to the development of the Lisbon Strategy cannot be questioned. For this reason, but not only, the objective of the document we examine today, namely the Wagenknecht report, to evaluate the contribution of policies applied to the fields specified for achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives, is salutary. It could not be otherwise, since the Lisbon Strategy proposes generous objectives, such as promoting economic growth and designing policies that would allow European companies to create more and better jobs. Nevertheless, reading the report, I was surprised, as a citizen of a recently acceded country, at the impression that it addresses a Union made up only of countries with developed economies, or rather, with equally developed economies, which is not true. It is very probable for some of the measures proposed not to have beneficial results for the less developed economies, taking into account that the general laws of the single competitive market favour strong economies, to the disadvantage of the weaker ones. Due to lack of time, I will not expand on this subject, but I consider that, in order for the report’s objectives to have beneficial results in the economies of all 27 countries, not 25, as specified in the text, it is necessary to perform the comparative review of their economies and, according to the results, to adopt a set of actions that would create equal conditions for developing the effects proposed by the project.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report on the table today demonstrates, once again, the relentless attack on Member States that operate low and successful corporate tax regimes. I do not accept that low corporation tax leads to unfair tax competition. I believe that ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the tax policy mix of a fully functioning single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where is the Commission’s evidence to prove that CCCTB will not hamper EU competitiveness? Where is the proof to say that it will benefit EU competitiveness? Why is it that countries with low tax, low unemployment and high growth are being attacked by the Commission? I do not understand it. It is absolutely farcical for the Commission to say that setting a tax base will not eventually set a tax rate, because that is already what the larger Member States are saying. It does not stand up to any kind of scrutiny.</p>
      <p sl="en">Attempts by large Member States to giftwrap tax harmonisation in the flowery paper of CCCTB will not be accepted by Ireland or other Member States. The fact of the matter is that it is not the right of Ireland, or any other Member State, to play a role in setting the tax rate of another Member State. The unity of Europe is not compromised by diversity in tax policies; rather, the EU’s competitiveness is undermined by the wrong tax policies. I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition, not tax harmonisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">How is it that a country like Ireland, and other Member States, which changed radically their tax policies and became successful economies, are now under attack? What is the attractiveness of a country like Ireland, Commissioner, if you bring in this system and eventually bring in tax harmonisation? Because that is exactly what it is, and the only way tax will go is up. It has already been said, by people within the Commission, that they want to see a tax regime more or less in the middle of what it is at the moment, which is approximately in the low 20%. What would be the attractiveness of Ireland or other peripheral countries? There would be not attractiveness, just high unemployment in the long …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report we have in front of Parliament today rightly states that tax competition in the EU has led, and continues to lead, to EU-wide economic gains by way of a dynamic corporate environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The CCCTB could just as easily lead to a less competitive EU and should not be supported, in my view. The EU needs to be responsive to an ever-changing global economy. Modern competitive economies need to be flexible to meet the changing requirements of new products and services. The CCCTB will undermine this flexibility for a number of reasons. An EU-wide corporation tax base will be inflexible and hinder an individual country’s ability to decide its own legal fiscal strategy, based on its particular circumstances. The CCCTB’s proponents assert that each Member State will retain its autonomy to determine its national tax rate – but will they? Is the CCCTB not the thin end of the wedge?</p>
      <p sl="en">If the CCCTB is optional, it merely increases the number of bases available to companies and makes the system even more complex. Domestic tax law offers certainty to business. A system that is applied in a number of Member States may lead to differences over how the provisions are interpreted, bringing about uncertainty for business.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the remaining time available to me, I can simply make some bullet points. First, taxation is a matter of national sovereignty for each Member State. The right to choose the level of public spending and the funding of such expenditure is a basic function of national democratic process. It is necessary to protect the flexibility of tax policy in rewarding enterprise and the creation of jobs and growth in the economy. A single base would do away with flexibility. There is no evidence to suggest that a common consolidated corporate tax base will address issues such as competitiveness, compliance costs for companies, transfer pricing and so on. It would not simplify EU tax issues, as the so-called ‘optional system’ proposed would add another layer, as I have just said.</p>
      <p sl="en">The harmonisation of the tax base would lead to pressure on national tax rates. Such harmonisation will only increase the attractiveness of non-EU corporate locations. The Code of Conduct on business taxation addressed harmful tax competition. Different tax rates in EU Member States are not harmful.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask the Commissioner, when he brings forward these proposals, as he suggests, next year, to please bear this in mind. Member States like Ireland have already given …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank our rapporteur here, for the quality of the work she has done and her efforts to come up with a text that, unfortunately, she does not seem totally satisfied with.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taxation is clearly an essential complement to the construction of a true internal market, if you want the market to be more than just a free-trade area where any form of tax and social dumping is permitted. The completion of the internal market therefore requires the harmonisation of certain rules on taxation and in the first place calls for the creation of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base. The report put before us today opens the door to this, and I am pleased about this. I note that a number of fellow Members are very actively against this plan, in the name of what they describe as ‘fair’ competition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Personally I believe that free, undistorted competition – and I am not a frenzied advocate of this type of competition – requires a certain amount of transparency as regards the rules. I am surprised that countries that have benefited from massive contributions from the European Union, in the name of solidarity, are today rejecting this step, which would be an important step forward in terms of solidarity, competition and transparency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Taxation is also a formidable tool that the EU must use if it is to implement its chosen strategies, because it does not have all that many tools. It can have a positive impact on the cleanest energies or to achieve …</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this is a report that is heavily influenced by the compromise between the PPE-DE and the ALDE. I believe it is largely a balanced report. The Member States’ responsibility for taxation policies is laid down, whilst there are a number of taxes that would benefit from greater EU coordination. In the rapporteur’s original proposal, there was thorough coordination with a strong emphasis on higher levels of redistribution. That cannot be a way to make Europe grow or to create new jobs. In the globalised world in which we live, it is not higher taxes that Europe needs. Instead, I think that we who live in high-taxation countries should look at other models, such as a flatter tax. In general, taxes should be lowered on work and raised on harmful consumption. For example, specific environmental taxes should be introduced, as well as reasonable excise duties on alcohol and tobacco, for example, as the Commissioner says.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here the EU must be able to act with greater accord. This is a politically sensitive issue – we have heard that here and I am well aware of it – but it is nonetheless necessary, in my opinion. If we are to resolve the major climate and energy challenges that we are facing, it would be irresponsible of us to rule out controlling fiscal instruments. It is possible to achieve high growth, with high environmental and energy taxes, and at the same time reduce the overall tax burden. Any doubters can look at the policy of the centre-right government in my home country, Sweden, if I can be allowed to be a little patriotic at the end of this debate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, in taking the floor in a debate devoted to the impact of taxation and customs policies on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that some of the suggestions relating to the Member States’ tax systems that are contained in Mrs Wagenknecht’s report will not have a positive impact on economic growth and employment in EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, moving away from tax competition and attempts to standardise solutions in the area of corporate income tax run counter to the principle of tax sovereignty for EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, lowering corporate tax rates while simultaneously doing away with any associated tax relief will not just fail to bring about a reduction in budget income from this tax; it will, in fact, increase it substantially. This is confirmed by the situation in my country, Poland, where the corporate tax rate has been substantially reduced, yet receipts from this tax are greater with each year that passes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly and finally, in this situation I consider the report’s suggestions relating to coordination and tax systems, including direct taxation, to be hazardous steps that will certainly not help to implement the Lisbon Strategy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Thank you Mr President. What are we talking about? One of the key issues is whether we are a match – in terms of competitiveness – for the external tax competition, in other words for tax competition from outside the European Union, and we should not be looking for scapegoats within the European Union. Otherwise, as several of my colleagues have stated, capital will leave the whole of the EU. What do we agree with in this taxation policy? We agree that it should facilitate job creation, in other words promote labour; we agree that we should help small and medium-sized enterprises, since these enable people to remain where they are, they help to reinforce families, and also to create jobs. I also agree with its social policy measures, which will help tackle the demographic challenge in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What do we disagree with? We disagree with over-taxing ourselves in areas relating to health, the environment or social policy instead of pursuing an anti-inflationary policy and seeking to respond appropriately to the challenges of competition. The other thing that we must bear in mind is that the European Union has expanded and become highly heterogeneous. We expect everyone to maintain budgetary discipline in their independent fiscal policy, but at the same time we want to minimise the instruments for doing this. If convergence is our primary goal, then in indirect taxation for example, such as excise duties, if we are to get anywhere, we should be obliging not only countries operating at around the minimum rate to achieve convergence, but also countries that apply much higher rates. This is why in several instances we have proposed replacing the current approach based exclusively on a minimum rate of excise duty by some kind of ‘code of conduct’ steering Member States along the same path. As regards common capital or the common tax base, I would like to say this: it would be a serious problem if this entailed punishing competitive countries, if the minimum rate were to be introduced. I am also apprehensive about what will happen as regards movement of capital when the common tax base is established. Will it not mean that profits from subsidiaries in the new Member States, for example, will constantly be reclassified in the accounts as profits of the parent company instead of being invested locally? Combating fraud is also very important, and I wish the Commission good luck with this. It is on the right track, since the most important thing is to regularise the black economy and take steps to combat crime. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the main aim of the Lisbon Strategy is to increase the competitiveness of national economies. A high level of competitiveness enables economic growth to be accelerated and new jobs to be created, and makes it possible to fund important social aims. Unfortunately the current tax system in EU Member States does not favour implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. The burdens placed on employment law and economic activity are too great, tax rates are too differentiated, and the regulations are too complicated. At the same time the tax system is burdened with an excessive number of functions and tasks – economic, fiscal, social or environmental.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For taxes to aid competitiveness, they must above all create incentives to work, to develop economic activities and to innovate. To this end taxes, especially direct taxes, should be set at a moderate level, avoiding unnecessary differentiation of rates and excessive progression. Since direct taxes exert a stronger, negative impact on production and employment, we must make greater use of indirect taxes when planning budgetary income.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In relation to the debate, Mr President, I wish to express my concern that there is too much ideology and politics, and too little real economic knowledge. The best example is the concepts that are used here, such as fiscal dumping or social dumping. There is no objective standard for taxation, and it is therefore not possible to accuse those states that apply low company taxation levels of fiscal dumping.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on a difficult and fundamentally successful operation to introduce the necessary amendments to the initial text, which was the original address.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Initially it was being suggested to us not only that the European Union should get involved in establishing the principles of corporation tax, but also that these taxes should be raised, against world trends. It is a good thing that we have avoided this. For similar reasons we should take a critical view of the support evinced in the text for tax base harmonisation. A Community tax base is a blow to tax competition in the EU, with all the associated negative consequences. Its introduction would limit Member States’ efforts to optimise corporation taxation against the Lisbon targets. In political terms this would burden the EU, which, in its own properly conceived interest, should refrain from trying to influence the shape of tax systems in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">We all ought to agree that the simultaneous existence of 27 national taxation systems seriously hampers the blooming of the full advantages of our single market. Moreover, there is indeed a genuine opportunity to reinvigorate the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy through EU-wide taxation and customs measures that would make the Union a more attractive place to invest and work. In extending and deepening more competitive markets, we should use all tools available, including more investment-friendly fiscal and custom policies, in order to boost employment, R&amp;D investments and the development of environmentally friendly technologies. In this respect, we warmly welcome the own-initiative report drawn up by Ms Wagenknecht, which aims at setting up the necessary fiscal framework to encourage risk and innovative investments in order to achieve the objectives of growth and employment. The advantages of simplifying and harmonising the taxation systems in the Union as a whole are obvious as not only it will help reaching the Lisbon objectives – through greater tax incentives for investments – but, furthermore, it will help achieve EU market integration by lifting remaining obstacles to the completion of the single market.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the results of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon. May I give a warm welcome to the President of the EU Council and Prime Minister of Portugal, José Sócrates. A very warm welcome this morning to the European Parliament!</p>
      <p sl="unknown">An equally warm welcome, of course, to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, and thank you to him for his work at the European summit.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, before we begin the debate I should like – and I do not wish to jump ahead at all – to thank the Portuguese Presidency sincerely for its enormous input and for the success achieved on Thursday night at around 1 a.m. when it approved the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">This is a great result for the European Union and a great result for us all. On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to add that without the European Parliament, we would not be where we are today. This is also a great result for us all because the Treaty was and is the top priority for the European Parliament if we are to come out ahead and be victorious in this Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">With these congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency, and also to the Commission – and I see Commissioner Wallström here, who has also made a significant contribution, next to the President of the Commission – it gives me great joy now to hand over to the President of the EU Council, José Sócrates. A warm welcome to the European Parliament!</p>

    <intervention id="2-037" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Sócrates" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to dedicate my first words today to the memory of a friend of mine. In memory of MEP Fausto Correia, who died a few days ago. He died young. His death is of course a great loss not only to the European Parliament but also to the Portuguese Socialist Party.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fausto Correia was a man of fine political and human qualities. You all had the opportunity to get to know him. He was an intelligent politician, open and always committed to noble European ideals. But I would like to lay special emphasis here on his human qualities of generosity, companionship and tolerance. Indeed, it is our human qualities that give meaning to our political life.</p>
      <p sl="pt">His passing is a personal loss to me, the loss of an old friend, with whom I shared many moments of my life, and I will miss him very much.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, when I presented the programme of the Portuguese Presidency to this plenary three months ago, I stated very clearly what would be the main challenge – the top priority – of the Portuguese Presidency: to draw up and reach an agreement on the new Treaty, putting an end to the six years of impasse in the institutional debate in which the European Union was immersed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Today, therefore, it is with great satisfaction that I address the house to present the agreement reached by the Intergovernmental Conference on 18 October. This agreement was the basis for the new Treaty of Lisbon. The Treaty will be signed on 13 December in the city whose name it will bear.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Portuguese Presidency began with the task of transforming the mandate that we inherited from the German Presidency – which as I have said before was of exemplary clarity and precision – but to transform that mandate into a new Treaty. That was our mission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The agreement we have reached confirms that the method and timetable we set out at the start of our Presidency were right. It was necessary – as I told you here at the start of the Presidency – to make the most of the June Council to endeavour to complete the Treaty not in December, as some advocated, but in October, at the informal Council, and we were right.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The truth is that we held the fastest Intergovernmental Conference in the history of the European Union on a treaty revision. We began on 23 July and completed it on 18 October.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When the history of this Treaty is written we will understand better the importance of that political decision, of not leaving until the end of the year the task that we were able to complete earlier. Europe needed a quick agreement and that is what it got. Europe needed a sign of confidence and that is what it got. Europe needed to turn towards the future and that is what it has done.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We worked speedily with all the Member States which, without exception, showed a constructive spirit and a will to overcome the remaining difficulties. This enabled us to present a full text of the Treaty on 3 October, and brought us much closer to our goal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The issues that remained for the Lisbon Summit were limited, though obviously politically sensitive. In this context, our strategy was to try to reach an agreement on the first day of the summit. This seemed to us not only possible but also highly desirable as it would send a strong signal to Europe. The signal that the EU is capable of taking rapid decisions, even decisions that everyone acknowledges are difficult. Moreover, it was very important that we should be able to resolve these institutional issues on the first day of the informal Council and, on the second day, right after that decision, to discuss globalisation and how Europe should tackle global issues.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Lisbon it was therefore possible to reach agreement on the following issues, enabling us to finalise the agreement on the Treaty:</p>
      <p sl="pt">First the Ioannina clause, and in the agreement a solution was reached at two levels:</p>
      <p sl="pt">a declaration relating to the system for decision-making in the Council by a qualified majority that clarifies the actual Ioannina safeguard mechanism;</p>
      <p sl="pt">in addition a protocol that determines how this mechanism for consensus in the European Council may be amended or revoked. As I have had the opportunity to say before, the Ioannina issue, as I saw it in the agreement at the last Council, required this clause to be mandatory by law, but not to be in the Treaty. The solution that we adopted, a declaration plus a protocol guaranteeing that the decision on Ioannina can be amended only by consensus, seemed to us to be the solution that was most true to the spirit of the last agreement.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thus we provided guarantees on the Ioannina compromise without undermining the integrity of the process of qualified-majority decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There was also a need to resolve a political issue regarding the number of Advocates-General in the Court of Justice. A declaration was agreed to the effect that the Council would approve any request from the Court of Justice for the number of Advocates-General to be increased by three (eleven instead of eight). In that case, Poland will have a permanent Advocate-General and no longer take part in the rotation system, while the existing rotation system will involve the rotation of five Advocates-General instead of the current three.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As for the appointment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, we agreed on a declaration to the effect that the European Parliament should take part in the appointment process even in the first stage, from January 2009, through appropriate contacts.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Conference also approved a declaration clarifying the delimitation of competences between the Union and the Member States as provided for in the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, the issue of the composition of the European Parliament. As you know, Article 9a of the Treaty on European Union has been amended to state that the number of MEPs shall not exceed seven hundred and fifty, plus the President, i.e. 751, maintaining degressive proportionality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Two declarations were attached to that amendment:</p>
      <p sl="pt">one stating that the additional seat in the European Parliament will be attributed to Italy;</p>
      <p sl="pt">the other guaranteeing that the European Council will give its political agreement on the composition of the European Parliament, based on the proposal from Parliament itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Council therefore accepted the criteria put forward by Parliament and went ahead with what it considered an acceptable adjustment, with a view to adapting the current framework during the 2009-2014 period.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Apart from the issues that I have mentioned, the concern of the Portuguese Presidency was also to build into the Treaty those rules and exception clauses that were in the mandate, naturally respecting the positions of the Member States that wanted to obtain them, but always concerned to avoid detracting from the Community decision-making process and the overall coherence of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Thus we have a new Treaty. It is a new Treaty and a good Treaty. A Treaty that resolves the crisis of the past and puts Europe in a position to set its eyes on the future. A Treaty with significant advances, some of which I would like to highlight, if I may.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Treaty adopts, without alteration, the enlargement of the European Parliament’s participation in the legislative process, as well as the innovations in the budgetary process, thereby enhancing the Union’s democratic legitimacy;</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Treaty improves the decision-making process, specifically by extending qualified-majority voting to the area of freedom, security and justice;</p>
      <p sl="pt">Again in the area of freedom, security and justice, this Treaty enshrines the necessary legal bases for the development of more effective immigration and asylum policies, as well as police and judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and organised crime that strengthens security for our citizens;</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Treaty clearly lists the areas in which the Member States have transferred powers to the EU;</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Treaty strengthens the supervisory role of the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, among all the advances contained in this Treaty, there is one point that I would like to highlight in particular: this Treaty explicitly gives legally binding force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, due to be proclaimed by the European Union’s three institutions on 12 December.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In addition is the EU’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and the fact that a solution has been found to the issue of the legal framework of European citizenship, as requested, moreover, by the representatives of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regarding external relations, the new institutional framework created by the Treaty – notably the addition of the post of High Representative and Vice-President of the European Commission for Foreign Affairs – is a reflection of Europe’s foreign policy ambitions, that will allow Europe to play a more prominent role on the international stage and give it the means to cooperate effectively with our partners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations were tough and demanding, but Europe succeeded. Europe succeeded and achieved the crucial objective of having a Treaty that asserts European values and strengthens Europe as a global economic player, and of putting in place more effective institutional conditions to enable Europe to play its role.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Europe therefore emerges stronger from this Summit. Stronger to face global issues. Stronger to take up its role in the world. Stronger because it has sent a signal of confidence to our economy and to European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Lisbon Treaty now demonstrates that Europe is ready, confident and self-assured. The Lisbon Treaty has once again made Europe ready for a new era.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Allow me to thank the European Parliament and its President, Hans-Gert Pöttering and its representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference – Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), Enrique Barón-Crespo (PSE) and Andrew Duff (ALDE). On behalf of the Portuguese Presidency I would like to thank you for your excellent collaboration in our work, your constructive suggestions, but mainly for your constant commitment to Europe reaching an agreement and to its reaching agreement quickly.</p>
      <a text="(Loud applause)"/>
      <p sl="pt">I would also like to thank the European Commission, especially the President of the Commission, to whom the Presidency is hugely indebted over these months for his valued assistance in bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion. Thank you very much, Mr President.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pt">However, I must also express my deep gratitude to the General Secretariat of the Council, especially its Legal Services and its Director-General, Jean-Claude Piris. On behalf of the Presidency, I would like to thank them for their hard work, skill and dedication. They did an absolutely magnificent job.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also like to thank all the representatives of the Member States who took part, at various levels, in the Intergovernmental Conference. The Presidency will not forget the spirit of cooperation, commitment and openness that everyone displayed in seeking the best solutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me now to give very personal thanks. I would like to thank the Foreign Affairs Minister, sitting next to me, Luís Amado, the Secretary of State, Lobo Antunes, and all the Portuguese diplomats who gave their best during this period to ensure that it would be remembered, without doubt, as one of the great achievements of the EU Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, having achieved the goal of finalising the Lisbon Treaty, the Heads of State or Government were able to devote the morning of day two to debating the external dimension of the Lisbon Agenda and how Europe should respond to the challenges of globalisation. It was an excellent debate, featuring the valued contribution of the President of the European Parliament. It was also a debate looking to the future.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The President of the European Commission presented an important contribution to the discussion, based on the communication on ‘The European Interest: succeeding in the age of globalisation’. This document was highly praised by the Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The main points covered in the debate were the financial markets in the light of the recent turmoil, and climate change in view of the Bali Conference.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Among the various conclusions that could be drawn from the debate, I would like to highlight one: the idea that pervaded the debate on that Friday morning, that Europe is now equipped – and even duty-bound in some areas – to lead the globalisation process; be it in the reciprocal opening-up of markets, improving environmental, social, financial and intellectual property standards, or strengthening strategic cooperation with our international partners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say one last thing before I finish. It is true that 18 October ended with an agreement on the Lisbon Treaty, but that day also began with another important agreement that I would like to tell you about here: the agreement between the European social partners on the new challenges for the labour market. This was also an important agreement. Through this agreement, the social partners set an example of constructive engagement, responsibility and social dialogue. A good example of attention to the need for dialogue, of the need for reform in a globalised and constantly changing world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to end on a personal note. In political life it is rare that we have the opportunity to serve our country and serve Europe at a critical moment. I feel honoured to have had that opportunity. I would like to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for the support from all the benches that I have always had in this House.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, our work is not finished. We have much to do. For my part I would like to assure you that the Presidency will continue to work with the same commitment, energy and conviction that we began with and to work for a stronger Europe and a better world.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Summit was a summit of a united Europe of solidarity. The EU has emerged from a period of six years of discussing institutional issues and from the divisions caused by those debates. We have reached agreement on the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First of all I would like to pay a sincere tribute to the work of the Portuguese Presidency, and especially to the determined leadership of Prime Minister José Sócrates. I would also like to extend these compliments to all of his team, whose skill and dedication I witnessed almost on a daily basis. It is also right to acknowledge the remarkable work of the German Presidency, especially of Chancellor Angela Merkel when she succeeded in defining a mandate, a clear and precise mandate that was the basis for the Intergovernmental Conference. However, it is also true that without the determination and competence of the Portuguese Presidency we would not now be celebrating the fact that we have transformed a mandate into a Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Allow me to say that it is of special significance that the Treaty will be signed on 13 December in Lisbon at the Jeronimo Monastery, precisely where the Treaty of Accession of Portugal to the European Community was signed. Twenty years after Portugal’s accession to the European Community, Portugal seems to be repaying Europe for everything it has done for Portugal by helping Europe to overcome this impasse.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Prime Minister, Portugal has every reason to feel proud of its work, of the work of the Portuguese Presidency in concluding the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let me also salute the European Parliament for its commitment during the IGC. Throughout this process the European Parliament showed a strong political will to resolve the institutional issue, being determined to reinforce European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I wish in particular to pay tribute to the role of President Pöttering and the delegation of the European Parliament – Mr Brok, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Duff – and to thank them for the constructive relationship they had with the Commission. This was, indeed, exemplary cooperation, and I think we both made a contribution to very important advances in the new Treaty, namely the issues of citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon is the first Treaty of the enlarged Union. It is the first time in the history of European integration that states which were once divided by a totalitarian curtain together negotiated and reached agreement on a common European Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is appropriate that we all remember today the importance of the Berlin Declaration, which celebrated not only the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome but also the emergence of a free and re-united Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let me recall today some of the predictions we have heard during the last two years. In 2005, after the two negative referenda, we heard some people saying that the European Union of 25 or 27 would never agree on a Treaty, whatever its content. There were far too many different national interests to allow the Union to reach a consensus, some sceptics said.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In 2007, critics said that Member States would never agree on a mandate. Then they said that a mandate from the June European Council would never be respected.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On my way to Lisbon last week I was still hearing some critics saying that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to reach an agreement and that delegations had even booked hotels until Sunday morning – maybe expecting to benefit from the very nice weather in Lisbon and Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The fact is that 27 Member States reached a consensus, respected the mandate and agreed on a Treaty – and all of this on the Thursday night, after dinner.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The success of Lisbon tells us that the European Union is, indeed, tougher than it looks, with a strong ability to recover from setbacks. I am proud to say that the European Union today is alive and delivering.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission is happy with the results of the IGC. The two non-negotiable conditions set by the Commission were fully respected. On the one hand, the Lisbon Treaty has clearly advanced from the current status quo. I always said that the Commission could not accept a solution less ambitious than the Nice Treaty. In fact we wanted as much progress as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, we fought hard to keep the competence of the Commission intact, and to keep the Community method at the centre of the European Union. There were, let us be honest, certain attempts to reduce and to weaken the competence of the Commission. Let me be clear, there is no European integration without strong European Institutions, and I believe this treaty will reinforce the European Institutions, not weaken them, because if you want the European Union to have an increased capacity to act, you need strong, effective, democratic and accountable European Institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon will reinforce the democratic nature of the European Union. First, thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament, there is now a clear definition of what European citizenship means.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Second, the Reform Treaty also gives legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be a central part of the system of checks and balances in our Union of Law. Together with President Pöttering and Prime Minister Socrates, we will proclaim the Charter in the European Parliament before the signature of the Reform Treaty. The solemn dignity of the Charter will thus be properly recognised here in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Third, the European Parliament will have a greater role in the legislative process of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The fourth democratic advance introduced by the reformed Treaty regards the rights of national parliaments, which will reinforce the principles of accountability and subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the central feature of the democratic nature of the Union remains the European Parliament. One of the things I most enjoy when I am in Strasbourg is to listen to the many political leaders and political figures from all over the world addressing this plenary on their aspirations for democracy, and their strong beliefs in freedom and individual rights. That really is one of the vocations of the European Parliament – to be the House for the voices of freedom in this world. It is something that should make all Europeans proud. When you hear those voices, you also realise what we have achieved in Europe, because once we also had people in European cities, marching for the same democratic rights. We should be very proud to live on a continent where, thanks to the European Union, we can enjoy fundamental rights, and we will say that together when we approve the Reform Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union faces many challenges, both internal and external. Our citizens want results. The Treaty of Lisbon will turn a new page in our ability to deliver, and will reinforce our capacity to act. In particular, the Treaty will introduce substantial advances in the area of justice and home affairs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Reform Treaty will also reinforce the European Union’s cohesion in external affairs. I personally attached the highest importance to one of the most important innovations in this Treaty, which is, precisely, the creation of a High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Policy who will at the same time be Vice-President of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is a great opportunity for the European Union to act in a coherent and united manner in the world. Our internal prosperity, our freedom and our security depend on the capacity of the European Union to act decisively at the global level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With the Reform Treaty, Europe will have the conditions and instruments to shape globalisation and not to hide from globalisation. We should not miss this opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I know that some committed Europeans are not happy with the number of opt-outs. The Commission and I would obviously have preferred to avoid those opt-outs and specific arrangements. However, diversity is a central feature of the European Union, and sometimes it requires political and institutional compromises. I would prefer to have specific opt-outs for specific countries than to be forced to lower the overall level of ambition of our Treaty and our Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The crucial point is that despite our diversity, we remain united regarding fundamental goals, fundamental values and fundamental principles. We have many tasks ahead: economic reform, growth and jobs, the reinforcement of social cohesion, our focus on innovation, our proposals on energy and climate change, and our programme for justice, freedom and security. We need to keep proving that we are not engaged in institutional navel-gazing and show that we are dealing with the real issues facing Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A great signal also came from the social partners on the very day of the beginning of our summit, when the social partners at European level agreed on an analysis of the labour market in Europe, and in general terms welcomed the concept of flexicurity. This showed that the social partners also want to work with us in this proactive attitude towards globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Regarding Lisbon, we also made progress on the second day of our summit. We discussed the great issue for the European Union in the 21st century, which is to promote the European interest in the age of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Our discussion was the natural complement to concluding the Reform Treaty. The message was clear: after concluding the negotiations on the Institutions, let us put those discussions behind us and face the real issues that are of most concern to our citizens, where they want to see us delivering concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We had a very positive debate. The paper presented by the Commission, based on the concept of the European interest, was fully endorsed, and the decision was taken to work on a declaration on globalisation for the December European Council, to show that tackling globalisation is a common thread in much of the European Union’s work today.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Heads of State and Government welcomed the concept of the fifth freedom: freedom of circulation of researchers and ideas, which is a cornerstone of our response to globalisation. That is particularly important, as we are engaged in crucial debates about Galileo and preparing to implement the European Institute of Technology.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I truly welcome the spirit in which that debate was held. It was clear that we now need to reinforce the external dimension of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. It was clear that, without further commitment from the Member States on issues regarding education, innovation, research and technology, we would not succeed. I think it is also fair to say that all Member States recognise the need for a European-level approach and that we need more action at European level if we really want to succeed in the age of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Commission has argued all along that institutional reform is important, but that we also need delivery of results, side-by-side. As the Commission said in 2005 and 2006, that twin-track approach was the way out of the institutional stalemate.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In Lisbon we achieved the strategic objective: we agreed on a Reform Treaty. Now it is crucially important to achieve a further goal, which is the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty before the European elections in 2009. I believe there is, indeed, a new political confidence in Europe. The last polls demonstrate the highest support for the European Union since 1994. The political climate is right to move ahead.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The IGC and the Lisbon Informal Council demonstrated that, when European Institutions and Member States cooperate, we are able to solve what seem to be even the most complicated and most challenging problems. It is my wish that the spirit of Lisbon which brought us a consensus on the EU Treaty will inspire the European Union in the year to come towards a successful ratification process. We need it for a strong European Union that delivers results for its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is primarily my own satisfaction and that of my group that I would like to express. Satisfaction at the result obtained last Thursday in Lisbon, and satisfaction at the road Angela Merkel set out on and Mr Sócrates continues to travel.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By equipping itself with the institutional tools it needs to function, Europe is finally acquiring the means to meet the major challenges of the 21st century. That was our wish. For this reason, we have supported this text since the start of its preparation, though as you know, most of us would have preferred a still more ambitious text. This Treaty is arousing criticism here and there. Personally I welcome the agreement reached in Lisbon, as it signals the start of a new European dynamic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Simplified Treaty, Reform or Reforming Treaty, Modified or Modifying Treaty, the name matters little. What matters is not the box itself but what is in the box. This Treaty will be officially signed in Lisbon on 13 December. That is an excellent date. The number 13 has always brought me luck. Look at my date of birth; I was born on the 13th, so it is excellent. It will then have to be ratified by all the Member States before the 2009 European elections. Some have already made it known that the process will begin the day after the signature in Lisbon, and I am delighted about this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To the heads of state or government of the European Union I would just like to say that it is important for this Treaty to be the basis of a European project founded on the true membership of its citizens. The EU institutions and Member States must try to achieve this by explaining, then by explaining and finally by explaining some more. What does this mean? It means giving substance to the provisions of the Treaty that affect the democratic life of the Union. The citizens’ initiative and the involvement of the national parliaments mean that information will have to be provided about the content of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines the essential rights of European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, it also means providing better information to our citizens about who the elected representatives in this Parliament are – there will be 751 of them in 2009 – and what they do. It means explaining how qualified majority voting, which will become the rule, will enable Europe to act in new areas such as judicial and police cooperation, environmental protection, economic policy and immigration. It also means explaining to our partners on the international stage that a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who will also be Vice-President of the European Commission from 1 January 2009, will be the primary contact, along with the President of the Council, who will be elected for two and a half years and will facilitate cohesion and consensus within the European Union so it can finally speak with one voice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the Treaty of Lisbon promises that the European Union will be more democratic, more transparent, more effective and more capable of acting as a single political entity on the international stage, it is to its citizens that this needs to be explained first of all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thanks to this Treaty, Europe will finally be able to move from discussion to action. It will be able to begin far-reaching and necessary reforms to effectively combat crime and terrorist threats. It will also be able to affirm its role as a world leader in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, when dealing with our international partners on such important challenges, we cannot allow ourselves to get caught up in unproductive divisions any longer. The journey that began in Berlin, that has stopped over in Lisbon and will pass through Ljubljana and Paris, is heading in the right direction because it is finally laying foundations for consistent European policies; policies that should aim primarily for the protection, well-being and prosperity of citizens who are demanding even more of Europe, as our Polish friends who turned out en masse to vote have shown us. For them and for all the others, let us live up to expectations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking Mr Sócrates and Mr Amado. They have had a difficult task, a very difficult task. On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I would say to them that they have completed this task most excellently. Congratulations, Prime Minister!</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Europe is facing major challenges – not only from now on, but for many years already. For years now we have constantly been debating the same problems. The gap between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger – within the European Union and throughout the world, between our continent and other continents. Social justice at home and social justice throughout the world is one of the major challenges for the EU. The states that belong to the United Nations and are island states have been crying out for help in the United Nations for years. Several of these states know that if climate change continues as it is and sea levels rise, they will be no more within the foreseeable future. There is nothing theoretical about climate change, but there is something practical that demands immediate action by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are facing challenges. You have rightly embraced one of these challenges in your Presidency: the challenge on the African continent. As super-rich Europeans, we cannot look on as this continent dies, either from civil wars or from Aids. The Portuguese Presidency was therefore well advised to focus on Africa. We – as Europeans, as states and as Parliament – are being asked to face up to this issue and have been asked to do so, ladies and gentlemen, not just for a few years now, but for a very long time. Since 2001, however, the European Union has primarily concerned itself not with these challenges, but with constitutional issues. This has taken far too long! It is good that this is now over, that the constitutional framework is finally in place so that we can now take on the political challenges on this basis. The great success of the past weekend is that we are now finally able to concentrate on what needs to be done politically and on what the people expect from us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there were some encouraging signs last weekend. The summit with the social partners is a step in the right direction. Capital and labour must be able to speak to one another again on an equal footing. For us Socialists, this is one element of this new draft Constitution – it should not be called this, and I must say that it has lagged far behind the Constitution – that social justice is practised here in Europe through greater co-determination on the part of the European Parliament. Nothing can be done in terms of a qualified majority without us Socialists, without the Left in Europe. I would therefore say that this Treaty will help Europe’s legislation to become more social, based on the aims you have agreed with the social partners at this summit. With future majority decisions, this finally gives us the opportunity – in agricultural policy as well, by the way – to tackle the reforms that we have long been reminding everyone about. These reforms are also necessary because anyone who wants to appear credible at the world trade round – at the Doha Round – and in Bali will at some point have to say: yes, we need a reform of EU policy on subsidies. This, too, is becoming possible with this Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are challenges that we must face. The President of the United States is talking about a Third World War and we are talking about whether the President of the European Parliament does or does not have voting rights! This is the kind of disproportionality that needs to be brought to an end in Europe. The draft Treaty will also be able to stop this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe we have taken a great step forward with this Treaty. Europe is becoming more democratic, Europe is becoming more transparent and the institutions are becoming more effective. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have to concede that we have not achieved everything we would have liked, and to those who are now screaming again that this is now in fact the Constitution – I read in some British newspapers that a few of our fellow Members are asserting that this is essentially the Constitution – I must unfortunately say that they have neither read the Constitution, nor have they read this Treaty. This Treaty lags far behind the Constitution. However, it is clearly more than Nice!</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, progress is not always made in the direction we would like. Sometimes it takes more time. One thing can be said, however: what is now on the table is better suited in terms of democratic policy, social policy and in terms of the institutions to giving us the capability and making us fit to effectively tackle the worldwide social challenges that are facing us. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is able to approve this Treaty, as are all my group’s delegations, and this was the result of our debate yesterday.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is fitting that the Reform Treaty should be signed in the city which Caesar once named ‘Felicitas Julia’, because it has overcome years of attack, siege, even last-minute subterfuge, to emerge bloodied and bruised, yet more or less intact, as the blueprint for a more democratic and transparent European Union. So Felicitas, Jose. May your name, like Caesar’s, forever be associated with the historic changes you wrought in Lisbon – changes like normalising codecision, ending the tyranny of Council vetoes, placing energy, and justice and home affairs, under democratic scrutiny: these changes give our Union the capacity to confront the challenges of globalisation.</p>
      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="de">It is a pity that the Treaty is not simpler to digest, but – after being butchered by the ballpoint pens of civil servants from 27 Member States – what would you expect? Your famous poet Fernando Pessoa once wrote: ‘No intelligent idea can gain general acceptance unless some stupidity is mixed in with it’. Well, in this case, the culprit was national interest, which watered down, or rendered indecipherable, policies and practices that are in all of our interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some of the national horse trading you engaged in made it look like comedy descending into farce: deciding that Austrian universities can break the law for another five years while the policemen look the other way, or creating two classes of European citizen: those with fundamental rights and those without. Or suggesting that the President of the European Parliament should forsake his right to vote; or, indeed, that Council has the right to determine Parliament’s Rules of Procedure. But the real tragedy is this: we saw not a single national leader return home flying the flag for Europe. Instead, they crowed about the opt-outs and the derogations and the exclusions which disfigure the text before us today.</p>
      <p sl="de">How do you guys expect to convince the people if you sound so unconvinced yourselves? If the poverty of aspiration implicit in a minimalist treaty is reflected in your poverty of enthusiasm? Look, it is your right to act as you choose, but it is also your responsibility. The only thing this Parliament need regret amongst the many successes is the process. The codes of transparency and democracy which drove the Constitutional Convention were a good deal preferable to secretive summits, and backroom deals in the wee small hours of Thursday morning. Issues of such importance should not be decided in such a kamikaze manner.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Nonetheless, again: congratulations. I propose a toast, with my glass half full: two cheers for the Lisbon Treaty. Let us hope its advances move us forward faster, and convert cynicism into renewed belief.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, the Union’s leaders are to be congratulated for reaching agreement on the new EU Treaty. Decisions will be easier to take within the EU institutions at EU level. That is exactly what the new Treaty will do. The EU works well when Parliament, the Commission, and the Council are all pulling together in the new spirit.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Mr President, whilst others may say what happened at the Lisbon Summit was shocking, I am of the firm belief that the elected representatives that are the governments of the peoples of the Member States of the European Union are entitled to defend what they see as the rights of their people within that Union.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I think that when we look at the overall example that has been given with this Lisbon Summit, we can see positives from it: we can see movement forward being made and, most importantly of all, an opportunity for a new zone and a new area of the development of the European Union to come into play, in particular with those areas where codecision now reigns on issues of environment, globalisation, research, education and the necessity of the response of the European Institutions to an ever-increasing speed of change within the world.</p>
      <p sl="ga">But there are also difficulties – and some colleagues have referred to them – in the area of justice and home affairs, for instance, where Ireland had to look for a specific opt-in and opt-out with regard to certain areas. That does not mean that we are against more cooperation and coordination. In fact, our role within Europol and within Eurojust in dealing with drug trafficking and tackling cross-border crime has been ahead of most. We are working with eight other countries in the Maritime Organisation Analysis Centre to combat cocaine trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="ga">But I think the one and most important issue, when we speak about democracy and ratifying this Treaty, is that the ratification process is another step towards informing the people and public of Europe of what we can do. Unfortunately, in only one country – my own country, Ireland – will there be a referendum. I would appeal to colleagues when we speak about the future development of Europe not to make the same mistake that President Prodi made when he was President of Commission by saying that this is only the first step towards a further treaty and further treaties which will bring about change, because the people who vote in the referendum ask the question: what is the point in voting on this treaty if we have to vote again on another one at some future date?</p>
      <p sl="ga">Allow us, where we have to connect democratically with the people, to tell them exactly what is in this Treaty and, most importantly of all, let this be a welcome to small and medium-sized countries of what can be achieved by defending their interests and rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has always been a staunch supporter of the compelling need for a European Constitution, of a brief, strong text, an expression of European democracy and of the cohesion of its peoples.</p>
      <p sl="it">We supported the Constitutional Treaty – albeit with its enormous defects – and today we hope that this confused thing, we cannot call it a simplified treaty because frankly that is a joke, which today you have presented to us, is ratified so that we can proceed, Mr Crowley, to the next stage.</p>
      <p sl="it">We will not join in the glorification of this result, which contains only backward steps compared with the Constitutional Treaty. Fortunately, Prime Minister Sócrates, the IGC was short. I do not know, had it been longer, what other masterpieces of clarity the Council and its legal and diplomatic service would have given us. Therefore, mercifully it was short.</p>
      <p sl="it">What matters to us today is to denounce those responsible for this situation, which we consider highly unsatisfactory: first of all, the European Convention and its President, who systematically refused to include in time on the agenda the breakdown of the dogma of the veto on amendments to the Treaty and today is paying the price with the systematic dismantling of his work and oblivion.</p>
      <p sl="it">No one, including Prime Minister Sócrates, has recalled the work of the Convention, here; the pro-European advocates of not having referendums, who find themselves today empty-handed, with less democracy, more nationalism and more confusion. The British Government and the British media system, which with all of its airs of pragmatism and reliability, in reality have shamefully given in to the howls of Murdoch’s tabloids and – after helping to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Constitutional Treaty much, much worse than what it could have been – have managed today to persuade public opinion that to have fewer rights, less protection, less transparency and less democracy is a great victory.</p>
      <p sl="it">This Parliament and the Commission, which have decided to remain silent for two years pending a miraculous initiative from Mrs Merkel, the European Council and the governments who have decided to snatch away the process of reform of the treaties from public opinion and national parliaments and to play the card of entanglement and confusion to save what could be saved.</p>
      <p sl="it">President, ratifications have now started, a process during which the Greens will not lie to public opinion. This text contains positive elements, but it is full of traps and spanners in the works. We will work so that the ratification and application of the new Treaty do not leave aside the fact that the path towards a truly free, open and democratic Europe is not over and that this is only a small stage, and is not even that glorious.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, General de Gaulle said of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing: ‘His problem is the people’. This statement would apply rather well to the European Council today. Once again, at the summit, the 27 Member States showed themselves to be very adept at horse-trading. The Prévert-style inventory of concessions granted to all the recalcitrant Member States deserves a mention. This is the cost of getting everyone to agree, from the descendents of the EU’s founding fathers to the most inveterate Euro sceptics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the end, only two or three things seem untouchable, and in the European Council nobody has thought of touching them. For example, the restrictive framework that the European Union’s economic and social policies must fit into: an open market economy with free competition, the issue of credit by the European Central Bank, the orientations of the Stability Pact, strict respect for freedom of movement of capital, the gradual removal of everything investors consider a barrier to trade, and the concentration of key powers in the institutions, which are inaccessible to citizens, national parliaments and even governments themselves, particularly in smaller countries, and indeed the dimensions assumed by military aspects in the European Union’s foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are ‘red lines’, as they say in English, which must not be crossed according to the EU’s ruling circles. The problem is that it is precisely at these issues that most of the questions and criticisms from our people are directed, and it is the persistent absence of answers to these questions, the repeated refusal to hear these criticisms, that is fuelling the crisis of confidence that the European Union is suffering from among our fellow citizens. Furthermore, if the members of the European Council had opened the windows of their meeting room on 18 October, they would have been able to measure the strength of this disaffection in person, as expressed on the streets of Lisbon by the largest demonstration seen in Portugal in the last 20 years, and I think that neither Mr Sócrates nor Mr Barroso will contradict me on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ultimate challenge for the European Union – we read in the Commission Communication at the Lisbon summit – is to explain to citizens what the European Union represents for Europeans. Always explaining, never taking account. Always communicating, never having open debates and therefore, with greater reason, not having referendums. Yes, the European Council’s problem is the people, but without the people there would be no future for a great European ambition. Surely this question really deserves to be discussed openly one day? That is what I am asking you.</p>

Yes, you remember, Mr Barroso, don’t you? The Lisbon Agenda. Here I was, seven years ago, being told that, because of that weekend meeting in Lisbon, we were about to become the most high-technology economy in the world with full employment and high growth rates. Well, as we know, we are 75% of the way through and the thing has crashed in ruins.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would not, if I were you, be too complacent about the summit you had in Lisbon last week either because, for once, the national parliaments will have their say. This, of course, is unusual because, generally, national parliaments do not have much to do any more, as the EU Institutions have usurped them. However, the national parliaments will have their say and there is a real chance that we will get more referendums than just in Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course that is the one thing that you people do not want, isn’t it? You loathe democracy so much now that you actually call it populism. You treated the French and Dutch referendums with contempt and you refused to take no for an answer. You are the Euronationalists, dangerous people who will stop at nothing.</p>
      <p sl="de">What that summit in Lisbon represented was a giant deceit and an attempt to impose upon the peoples of Europe a constitution just by dropping that word and repackaging it, when it actually has all the same proposals. It is absolutely disgraceful that you are doing this, but I have hope and faith that in Westminster, the Mother of Parliaments for once will do her job and the British people will get a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have heard enough from the political classes of Europe. It is time that in Britain and in many other countries of Europe we heard what the people have to say. You cannot push on with this project without the support of the people. Let the people speak.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two and a half years after the French and the Dutch rejected the European Constitution, in Lisbon on 19 October the European Council adopted the simplified Reform Treaty, which is a very bad name for it since it has been made more complex and only marginally ‘reforms’ the rejected Constitution. In short, they are trying to pull the wool over our eyes and convince us that this text has nothing in common with the previous one, to avoid facing up to the people of Europe with a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You seem to be saying that this is too serious a matter to be entrusted to the people. Well, we think the exact opposite. Insofar as this is a cut-and-paste of the European Constitution, it deserves to be put to a referendum on ratification in each country, starting with France and the Netherlands. Only a referendum can cancel what another referendum has decided. Today, without trying to be party political, I am launching a big petition in my own country to try to make the French President who initiated the European mini-treaty do a U-turn and offer a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is about the future of our respective nations, their sovereignty, independence, identity and freedom. We cannot, for example, give responsibility for representing us abroad to a High Representative, any more than we can watch our seat on the United Nations Security Council being challenged in the name of the legal personality of the European Union. Or allow our judicial and legislative corpus to be dismantled by judges in Luxembourg. The parties to such a denial of democracy would carry a heavy burden of responsibility before history.</p>

      <p sl="sk">At the Meeting of the Heads of State and Government last week, a Treaty was agreed that should adapt the European institutions to a new situation and improve the existing Treaties. Since the present structure of the European Union is vastly different from what it was in 1957, we have to adopt a new European document; we need clear new rules. I fully support this process.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In order to be trustworthy, the European Union must guarantee human rights and fundamental liberties to its citizens. These values are mentioned several times in the preamble and in the articles of the Treaty, and the Union is founded precisely on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality. I regret very much that although in Article 3 of the new Treaty we profess to act strictly in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter protecting human rights, in the same breath we refuse to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the Treaty. I am generalising on purpose because I do not wish to point the finger at individual Member States that refuse to express their opinion on this important issue. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is absent from the Treaty and I regret this. Does the Charter not endorse human rights, enshrined in constitutional traditions and common to all Member States?</p>
      <p sl="sk">I believe that the Members of this Parliament currently play a very important role in the process of reforming the Treaty; they defend the opinions of the people of Europe and they should act as a catalyst for consensus in areas such as human rights.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, President-in-Office, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has succeeded in drawing up a mandate and the Portuguese Presidency in achieving acceptance of it and implementing it. For this you have my thanks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Because of the discussions of recent days about a number of minor matters it has been forgotten that this Treaty is a breakthrough in democracy and the capacity to act, because the European Parliament now has 95% of legislation in a codecision procedure, because the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure has been removed and full rights are available in the budget sector and in the agricultural sector, the European Parliament has something to say on third country treaties and on ratifications, the European Parliament elects the Commission President and without the European Parliament, the Commission and the High Representatives do not take up office.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is the case that democracy and the capacity to act have been created with the removal of the third pillar and that with the new decision-making methods in the Council for the expansion of codecision, the capacity to act has been improved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Codecision and qualified majority decision-making are now the rule in legal terms. This is a reversal of matters, which is of great significance. The Charter of Fundamental Rights and legal personality are there and furthermore the United Kingdom’s red lines have been preserved in their entirety because in these areas there are opt-outs in legal and internal policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We still have to clarify certain matters: the issues associated with Article 24. We must fight to ensure that the transition from one Treaty to the next is not misused by the Council with regard to the allocation of posts, such as those of the High Representatives, for instance. We are merely able to state that there are 751 Members of the European Parliament and I see no post where there is a difference in voting rights within this text.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, I must state that we really do have to ensure now that this text is implemented, that we translate the Constitution into reality in the way we understand this Treaty. Mr President, allow me to make one comment. In 1994 I was appointed for the first time on behalf of this House – for which I should like say thank you – to the Westendorp Group. This was my fourth intergovernmental conference. When we started, we had nothing to say as Parliament. I should like at this point to thank Mrs Guigou, Mr Tsatsos, Mr Hänsch and Mr Méndez De Vigo, as well as my two fellow Members from the Intergovernmental Conference, for their great cooperation over these last 13 years.</p>

      <p sl="es">Enrique Barón Crespo, European Parliament representative at the Intergovernmental Conference – President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I can testify as someone who was present at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference – I think that it is the first time that the President and the three representatives have been admitted to the Conference – and I can say that the Portuguese Presidency has listened to the European Parliament: firstly by restoring citizenship, something that appeared to be impossible until mid-September, and secondly, by giving proper treatment to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also seemed impossible, and also by recognising the substantial extension of majority voting.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not only the European Parliament that has gained things, it is Europe, and we have helped. The President-in-office started his speech by talking about Ioannina. I challenge him that we should explain to the people of Europe what the Protocol is on the Ioannina Declaration, and what has surprised me most is that governments have not fought very hard in the Council to stop the introduction of the Luxembourg Compromise into the Treaty, which would mean destroying it.</p>
      <p sl="es">More or less the same applies – and I am addressing the President of the Commission – to the subject of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. You are going to have to work very hard on that, because Parliament is going to defend its rights in order to ensure that there is an intelligent solution when the Treaty enters into force, which I hope will be the case, given that there will be a series of very interesting posts to allocate and, of course, we want to monitor this process democratically.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, Mr President, Prime Minister Sócrates said that the Treaty of Lisbon has been born. It is still a very small child, and I hope that in December everyone signs that they want it to grow, and, above all, that everyone acts with mutual loyalty and solidarity so that this Lisbon Treaty becomes a reality.</p>

Of course, the Treaty lacks the simplicity of its late, lamented predecessor, but it preserves all the principal reforms. Abroad and inside the Union, people will soon see a more effective, efficient and democratic Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">But in one country this is not so. The British still seem intimidated by the success of the EU and have sought, at the IGC, to reduce the scope and force of common policies in the area of fundamental rights, freedom, security and justice, and in the common foreign security and defence policies. Why such a strategy of non-cooperation is thought to serve the interests of the British people is not clear. Nor do Mr Farage or the Conservative Party provide a preferable or alternative solution.

      <p sl="pt">President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the best way of celebrating the important result achieved last weekend, thanks to the mandate negotiated during the German Presidency and the effective commitment of the Portuguese Presidency, that I would especially like to commend, is to make effective use of the new institutional instruments and achieve better results.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Recently, European citizens have repeatedly been told, quite rightly, that we needed a new institutional framework to adapt the Europe of Nice to the Europe of enlargement. It is now time to prove that this reorganised Europe is capable of fulfilling its new mission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fifty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome the threat hanging over Europe is no longer that of war or perpetual walls of woe. The new challenge is to face the global world in which there are ever more people consuming and producing, where borders are disappearing and no European country is really a world player. We have to face the fears of globalisation and the technology revolution and prove that Europe, strengthened by the new Treaty, is capable of discovering new paths and creating new wealth. Yet this is also an opportunity to devise new solutions to the new problems. With six, twelve or even fifteen members it was easier to promote closer ties between citizens and the Community structures, but today it is the toughest of challenges.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As the EU enlarges, the centre of power is also becoming more distant from the citizen. This adverse effect can be seen, inter alia , in the end of the rotating presidencies of the Council or the abandonment of the principle of one Commissioner per Member State. We have to counter this adverse effect and Parliament has a decisive role in this task, to attain more transparency and less bureaucracy, more development and less unnecessary legislation, more cooperation with national parliaments and less distance from citizens, more cohesion and less inequality. Freed from the doubts about our internal organisation, let us be a symbol of courage and let us take up the challenges of modern times. Today we should celebrate our capacity to unite.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, satisfaction, happiness, success, victory, are words that have been used here today, and rightly so, about the informal Council in Lisbon. Indeed, the agreement on the new Treaty was announced before midnight on 18 October. It was a historic moment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly because of the results achieved, but also because it was done so quickly. After a little more than 12 months of intense work and negotiation it was possible to achieve the required consensus on the first day of the Summit. What is more, on the same day an agreement was signed with the European Union’s social partners, employers and trade unions, to modernise the labour market, an important step for the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Portuguese Presidency is to be congratulated. It achieved its top priority with acknowledged skill: to give Europe a new Treaty, which was a great victory. Europe has emerged from a six-year impasse and can now concentrate on what is really important to citizens because, as Jean Monnet said, we cannot stop when the whole world around us is on the move, and the speed at which the world turns makes no allowance for a slow European response.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Treaty will be signed on 13 December, and the ratification process will follow, which should be swift and problem-free. As a Portuguese national I want to say how pleased I am because, once again, the name of Lisbon is indelibly linked to a decisive moment in European integration. Thank you Prime Minister Sócrates. You deserve thanks from Portugal and also from Europe for your determination and commitment. Europe is out of the impasse. Thank you very much, Prime Minister.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, fortunately the Lisbon Summit ended well. Some excellent preparatory work was carried out by the German Presidency, and the Portuguese Presidency completed it in a professional manner. Unfortunately, I must point out that national interests have again played a role. This is definitely not appropriate for European cooperation. We must now have special powers to discuss the content instead of the process. However, we have unfortunately seen depressing tendencies that suggest that we would rather discuss the process rather than the content. However, if we are ultimately to discuss the process then I would like to state clearly that we do not need referendums to ratify the Treaty. Referendums are simply not the solution. Let the representative democracy do its work!</p>
      <p sl="da">It is not because I am afraid of a no vote – far from it! Rather it is because it is completely wrong to separate EU issues from national parliamentary elections. The EU is and will remain a completely integral part of national policy. Referendums are used to fire shots at a government in office. They enable the other political parties to avoid being assessed on their EU policies. However, all political parties will of course be assessed on their EU policies, and this will happen when we go to the polls in the national elections. However, it imposes two requirements: a requirement that we, the electorate, allow EU policy to be decisive in our choice of national politicians, and a requirement that the political parties must of course not use referendums to avoid responsibility for the European Community. Therefore, efforts to ensure that it is the content and not the process that is given the highest priority will hopefully be successful.</p>

This is not so that the proposed changes to my convictions as regards integration can be put into full effect – at times they are very remote from that. The reason I am pleased is rather that lately we have been devoting too much time and political energy to institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am convinced that the EU’s success is not the result of the institutional set-up or the mechanics of power. This success is the result of political will and a common vision of the future. I hope that once ratification is concluded there will be nothing to stop us from engaging in a Europe of results, from taking more responsibility for global security, from having a more active impact on neighbouring countries, and finally from discussing EU enlargement, from winning in terms of competition, investments and growth. Despite what has been being said over the past seven years, institutional changes are neither a complete nor a satisfactory response to these problems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, from Europe’s many upheavals, peasants wars and revolutions, we are all familiar with the romantic story of the fugitive being hidden in a cart-load of dung to be taken over the border and escape Richelieu’s bloodhounds and the king’s guards. If, at the end, he is successful, he does not look very nice, nor does he smell very nice, but once he has washed, then it can be said: he is alive!</p>
      <p sl="de">The Constitution has fared similarly. Governments have buried it in a tangled mass of illegible, indecipherable texts of opt-outs, clauses, footnotes, resolutions, Minutes, and they have taken the Constitution beyond the limits under cover of this dunghill. The tragedy of it is simply that they sought shelter in this constitutional treasure not from the king’s guards, but from the watchful eyes of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been digging in this tangled mass of texts. Yes, I have actually found all the main achievements of the Constitution on which I myself have been working for more than 10 years and I could well be fortunate. This situation nevertheless makes me very apprehensive. In addition, of course, as is simply the case with such adventures, whenever anyone helped the fugitive, they ripped off part of the treasure. I have therefore also found the hands of a few governments in this dung hill. One has secured another opt-out for itself and therefore filched a part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a part of Parliament’s rights, a part of data protection, etc. The treasure arrives damaged, but generally speaking it does arrive.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have gained a piece of Europe, we have saved a piece of Europe’s future, not with our citizens, but without our citizens, not with the parliaments, but without the parliaments, and this is a great danger. We have gained a piece of Europe, but we have not resolved the crisis of confidence among Europe’s citizens.

Apart from being a deep insult to democracy and the sovereign will expressed, this demonstrates your fear of citizens’ votes on a Treaty that represents a qualitative leap in the advance of neoliberalism, federalism and militarism, increasingly eroding the economic and social achievements of workers and the poor.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the struggle will continue, as more than 200 000 people made clear at the impressive demonstration in Lisbon promoted by the CGPT also on 18 October.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, after the failure of the Constitution it seemed that the principle of democratic decision-making had once again gained the upper hand within the EU, at least for a while. We were wrong to think that. Very quickly the same Constitution has returned to the table under a different title. Its authors do not even bother concealing the fact that it is the original Constitution in a slightly modified form with the intention of ignoring the people’s democratic will in a referendum.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Treaty, which reinforces the role of non-elected officials of the EU, thereby reinforcing the democracy deficit, is creating, among other things, 105 legislative and non-legislative competences of the EU. In 68 cases it replaces the right of national veto with majority decision-making. It subverts the national competences in the area of foreign policy. It hands decision-making in the EU to the big Member States, notably Germany, at the expense of the small countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">A simple comparison shows that it is almost exactly identical to the Constitution for a European federal state rejected by the French people and buried by the Dutch. The impertinence with which it has been returned on the table with the straight face of a poker player and now under a new Orwellian title is astounding. A new type of utopian nationalism won in Lisbon: pan-European and EU nationalism; nationalism without any real national, cultural and historic foundations, rooted only in the long office corridors in Brussels. Berlaymont patriotism has claimed victory.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Those of us who represent countries that lived for nearly half a century under the communist totalitarian regime are not easily surprised by anything. We have been accustomed to the insolence of power and contempt for the people’s will. Not even in the CMEA, however, have we experienced such overt deception as today’s deception by the EU of the people of the Member States. At least in the CMEA similar attempts were hidden behind the party politburos; but that is a thing of the past.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, under the Reform Treaty, which I reject, there are winners and losers. The reservations of Poland and Italy regarding the new distribution of seats in Parliament were resolved, except that Poland is winning other more important battles: it obtained the opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it will have an Advocate-General at the Court of Justice and it benefits under the Ioannina mechanism. Even Austria won a victory by being allowed to restrict access by foreign students to the country’s universities.</p>
      <p sl="it">Romano Prodi, before entering the meeting, announced that he would fight not to lose Italy’s parity. He ended up losing parity with France but restoring parity with the UK, boasting of the promise secured to reconsider the distribution of seats based on citizenship after 2014. However, we had already obtained this at the last plenary in Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="it">What was accepted by the indolent Prodi administration were just a few crumbs from the table, as a result of which around three million Europeans with Italian citizenship are considered to be less European than the Pakistanis, Indians and Kenyans who have the good fortune to work and live in the UK, or the Cameroonians in France, who, although non-Community nationals, are counted for the distribution of seats.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, after a detailed reading of the Lisbon Treaty it is clear that the heads of state are presenting fundamental changes to the EU documents.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Reform Treaty literally re-writes the EU Treaties and the founding Treaties of the European Communities. I would like to highlight the fact that the changes do not just concern the influence of individual states on EU processes, but also the fundamental principles themselves, on which the EU was established 50 years ago. The Reform Treaty transfers the principle of free competition from the main body of the Treaty to the protocols that are to be annexed to the Treaty. I consider that a red flag for all democratically-minded citizens.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Ladies and gentlemen, if the EU project is to be credible, the Reform Treaty has to be put to a referendum in the Member States. Politicians should set aside their arrogance and comfortable situation. They have to explain the decision taken in Lisbon to the citizens and win them over to it.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his statement this morning and, whilst I note the decisions of the Heads of Government, the British people and the British Conservative Party have been consistent in their concerns about the Constitution and the very similar Reform Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">The British Prime Minister has said that the Reform Treaty is not the Constitution. His fellow leaders have disagreed. He told us that Britain’s so-called ‘red lines’ have been secured. Like most British people I really do not understand or believe our Prime Minister on this matter. The issue is one of trust. Our Prime Minister gave a commitment to hold a referendum – a commitment in an election manifesto two years ago. A referendum on this Treaty is, therefore, not only politically necessary but also a moral imperative.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Irish Prime Minister said at the weekend about possible referenda: ‘Why not let your people have a say? I think it’s a bit upsetting to see so many countries running away from giving their people an opportunity’.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few days ago, Gordon Brown said that this Treaty will mark the end of EU institutional reform for the next decade. However, over the past 15 years we have had four treaties dealing with reform, and I doubt whether the urge to have further institutional change can be resisted. The so-called ‘ratchet clause’, for example, would allow further national vetoes to be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, the Conservative vision for Europe focuses on the three key areas of global competitiveness, global climate change and global poverty. I congratulate President Barroso in particular for his determination, in any event, to pursue those aims. However, they can be tackled with political will and do not require this Treaty. We should remind ourselves of what the Laeken Declaration said. It said the Union needs to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient, but it called also for us to engage the citizens more and not just to communicate our decisions to them. The question today is: does the Treaty respond to Laeken? Laeken asked the right questions. Have we given the right answers?</p>

I know that all the maximalists here do not think it is the most beautiful treaty they have got, but the real world is not the most beautiful world you can get. So what you need is an effective treaty, a treaty of clear values – and you have got it.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the second day, friends, we got a direction – on the first day a treaty, on the second day a direction – which deals with what people would like us to do: the real world. What you said on the second day was that we want a Europe leading globalisation to be more human, to be more inclusive and to base it on our social coherent values. What you said was that the Lisbon process is not only a process for a few, but the guideline for the external direction of the European Union, which says that it is not only about being the world’s strongest economic power, it is also by understanding that the world will only be more cohesive by basing it on a social market economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is what I want to underline to you today. I want to thank the Presidency, not only for the first day but also for the second day, because the conclusion of the second day was that this European Union is not about market societies.

Obviously there are some regrets that can be expressed: regrets about the abandonment in the text of the symbols of the European Union; regrets about the opt-outs won by some countries, particularly on the Charter; and finally regrets about the complexity of the Treaty, for which I am requesting a consolidated text so that Europe’s citizens can try to find their way around it. That would be good.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All the same, this Treaty will give us the means to revive Europe, provided that we want to do so. With this text, the European Union will gain the tools it needs to continue its integration, to expand and to deepen its common policies. On energy, climate change, immigration policy, the fight against terrorism, economic coordination, foreign and defence policy and development policy, Europe can now move forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It will simply be a question of political will. Nobody will now be able to use the excuse that the institutional means of action are lacking. Now, everybody will have to face up to their responsibilities, and in saying that, besides our institutions, I am thinking in particular of the Member States. That is good news for Europe and I hope it will be good news for its citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, contrary to the gloom-laden forecasts and baseless criticism of Poland during recent debates in this House, especially by the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Lisbon Summit turned out to be a diplomatic compromise. Both the EU and the Polish authorities perceived the potential to reach an agreement. The EU side showed an appreciation of Poland’s importance and potential by increasing the number of Advocates General in the Court of Justice, and also by retaining the Ioannina clause.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must hope that the compromise reached at the summit is only an introduction to consultation with the peoples of Europe. The draft EU Reform Treaty is, in the end, too important a document to be smuggled through in the secrecy of political meeting rooms. Let us not forget that the previous version of this treaty died in two Member States’ referendums. Failure to allow the public to have their say once more on the future of the EU would not only be a breach of one of the EU’s fundamental values but would also provide clear evidence that those in government fear the voice of their own electorate. Let the dictators of democracy allow the public themselves to express their will as regards the future vision of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">I accept the need to reform the Treaties and to create more open, democratic, efficient and accountable governance. In principle, I support an extension of QMV and codecision with the European Parliament, but the very diversity which Mr Barroso quite rightly referred to will always mean that national interests will be promoted. We should not lose touch with our local communities by trampling over their interests, or appearing so to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">For Scotland, there is a very real fear that the entrenchment of the common fisheries policy, as an exclusive competence within the Treaties, can only obstruct the absolute root-and-branch reform of fisheries management that I believe to be necessary. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the UK Government did not raise this issue at the summit. Yet again, Scotland’s key interests have been ignored by a UK Government.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Constitution is dead. Long live the Constitution! How else to describe the events in Lisbon? We all agree that this Reform Treaty is a mere clone of the Constitution rejected by the French and Dutch; one that, as Valéry Giscard d’Estaing said, is even less readable than the original. After all, referendums are to be avoided at all costs, we are told.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is indeed one major difference from 2005. This time the French, Dutch and other European peoples are not being given the chance to express their opinions. An illustration of this disdain for democracy can be found in the statements of Commissioner Wallström, who always has so much to say about bridging the gap between Europe and the citizen. She is urging the national parliaments to ratify this text as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yet genuine respect for democracy requires that the citizens of all EU Member States be able to express their opinions on the Treaty, a text which, in numerous respects, erodes the sovereignty of the nation-states even more than is already the case. Those responsible should not complain if this fear of citizens again goes against official Europe in the subsequent European elections.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, gentlemen, you certainly do not have it easy at the moment! In the countries in which referendums were promised, the Treaty is portrayed, as in the United Kingdom or in my home country, Austria, as just a minor detail, an extension of something. In other countries, like Germany, the talk is of a total reorganisation of the Community and of a historic breakthrough. Which is now true?</p>
      <p sl="de">I think we should remind ourselves again on this occasion of the words and very clear sayings of the former President of West Germany, Roman Herzog, who was after all Chairman of the Convention responsible for drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights and who said that democracy is being eroded by the EU Constitution. We now have it in a modified form in the Reform Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you do not want it to be eroded, if you do not want democracy to be choked, please have the political decency at least to allow referendums, as there have been in the past – for the last EU Constitutional Treaty – even in Spain and Luxembourg.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, looking at the changes the Reform Treaty makes in such fields as migration, agriculture, and police and justice, and at the decisions regarding the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the euro area and the social market economy – which becomes an objective for the first time – and also regarding intergovernmental solidarity on energy, it is apparent to me that this Treaty builds on the results of the Convention and the June Summit, and gives us more clout and a great deal more democracy as political institutions. From now on, the Union will be better equipped to provide the answers people expect of it, both internally and externally.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the latter respect, I should like to congratulate the Council Presidency on its setting of the agenda. President-in-Office, by letting your summit not only decide on the Treaty, but also exchange ideas about the problem of our generation – globalisation – you have sent out an important signal. When all is said and done, it is not the institutions – institutional navel-gazing – but their policies that are important.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This brings me to a question to the President of the Commission. Do you think that genuinely bold policymaking is possible in the period from now until the final ratification of the Treaty, or does ratification make you fear that you cannot offend people and that you must confine yourselves to ‘cautious’ matters? In other words, can the Europe of specific projects continue in 2008?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, two more brief questions to the Council. President-in-Office, have you asked the Heads of State or Government for a personal political commitment to bringing ratification to a successful conclusion in their respective countries? I very much hope so. Secondly, when will a coordinated text of these treaties appear? After all, a treaty that includes the objectives of transparency and simplification must be readable, if only out of respect for the people. Thank you, Mr President, and thank you in anticipation to the President-in-Office and the Commission President for their answers to my questions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have the Lisbon Strategy and hopefully we are now to have the Lisbon Treaty too, and both will move Europe forward. This Parliament, particularly the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been fighting and working for a new European treaty for seven years. Admittedly we have not got the Constitution, but we do say that this Reform Treaty represents progress in every respect. There is no single item on which we have fallen behind compared with Nice. Everything is moving forward and bringing us further into the Union of 27. We also need to say this to the citizens outside.</p>
      <p sl="de">The winners in the new Treaty are the people of Europe. There are diverse forms of direct and indirect participation in European policy and we are in a position to solve the major problems referred to here faster and more effectively. The winners are also the citizens’ chambers in Europe, the national parliaments and this European citizens’ chamber, this Parliament. Democracy is not therefore being eroded – as has just been said, and which is complete nonsense – but it is the completion of European democracy, which we can actually achieve with this Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">This has now been the fourth agreement. I hope it will be the last time that the Member States have to get together for this. Every power must now be invested in ratification. I hope that no country says no. It is perhaps the last chance for this Treaty. Every no would lead to isolation, if not to that country’s self-exclusion. We hope this will not be the case. Every power should flow into ratification so that we have this Treaty by 2009.</p>

We have heard some examples of it in this Chamber this morning.</p>

However, Parliament, the Commission and the Council now have another 18 months in which to restore public opinion following this crisis period.</p>
      <p sl="it">All of us, or at least the majority of us in this Chamber, believe that Europe is the solution to globalisation concerns, and not the cause, and that we are stronger if we tackle immigration, climate change, innovation and research together.

Yet this was not enough for the evanescent Mr Prodi, who seemed like Alice in Wonderland in Lisbon, totally lost and misinformed. Thanks to Mr Prodi, Italy was excluded from the declaration, from the joint declaration with which France, Germany and the UK quite rightly asked Europe to take steps to avoid a repetition of the financial turbulence resulting from the US sub-prime crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">According to statements made to the press about the global financial crisis, Mr Prodi said that he could not see the point of Europe’s position on lending.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, the spokesperson for my Group, Mr Daul, said that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is satisfied, and this is because we have got out of an impasse, but we are not happy. This is due to the not very pro-European atmosphere among the governments, which contrasts with the polls that President Barroso referred to concerning the will of the European people, and also because the Lisbon Treaty ultimately includes many made-to-measure elements for governments that want more and more for themselves and less and less for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">President-in-Office of the Council, you referred – and I would like to congratulate you on the agreement that has been reached, because I would like to stress that I think that the agreement is important for getting us out of the impasse – you referred to three issues that I would like to highlight.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, I think that it is very important to have a formal proclamation in this House of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This was not done in Nice, it was done in secret. Let us now do it formally, because the Charter of Fundamental Rights, with or without opt-outs, is the DNA of the European people.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Mr President, I am concerned about the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, because what you have adopted violates a principle that is in the Treaty, which is degressive proportionality. Is it going to come to Parliament? We will see what we do, but you are well aware that what you have adopted does not provide degressive proportionality.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the High Representative. I think you have reached a good agreement, but I think that the President of the Council, the High Representative and the President of the Commission form a package, which we will have to discuss in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">In summary, Mr President, I think that it was Paul Valéry, who was a great poet and, perhaps therefore a great European, who wrote that a poem is never finished, only abandoned. The construction of Europe never finishes. In this case we have, in the interests of consensus, abandoned some of the advances of the Constitutional Treaty, but we will be here to keep fighting for them. We will also have supported them in a sentence of the preamble which, ironically, was rescued from the flames: an ever closer union between the peoples of Europe.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Netherlands also shared the sense of relief on Saturday morning about the agreement reached, and for this, too, I believe thanks are due to the President-in-Office of the Council. The new Treaty enables the European Union to progress. The Union will become more decisive and democratic. The European Union is back on its feet. It can now concentrate fully on its substantive task; back to work with an agenda ranging from the further development of the social Europe to a better-coordinated foreign policy. This is also the best way to bring Europe closer to its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My country, the Netherlands, has seen a great deal of discussion about the nature of the Treaty that has now been adopted and about its differences from the Constitutional Treaty the country rejected in a referendum. The conclusion was that the differences are such that a second referendum is not necessary. The new Treaty lacks the constitutional nature of the original Constitution; and so we, too, have no need for a further referendum. Thus it will just be a case of normal parliamentary ratification.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The reforms that have been decided on have our wholehearted support, as they make substantial progress – particularly concerning the rights of the European Parliament – without fundamentally altering the balance between the Member States and the European institutions. A larger Union needs different, more wide-ranging rules. Hopefully, all Member States will now drive ratification forward, so that we can all get going with the new rules in 2009, in order to take forward the substantive role of the Union in all areas in which our citizens have expectations of us.</p>

The European Union needed a way out of the sense of defeat and failure, it needed a political dimension, and thanks to the Portuguese Presidency, it has one.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also consider it to be of exceptional importance that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is an element of those decisions, and I would like to add here that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is the compass, the instrumentarium, of Europe. I cannot even imagine how a country that wishes to be part of the European Union could at the same time dissociate itself from that which constitutes its moral, philosophical and political foundation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Critical words were spoken by my colleague Mr Duff regarding the position of the British Government, which demanded an opt-out. I am in a better position. The Polish Government, which asked for an opt-out as the result of a decision taken by the Polish people, is leaving power. I would like to express the profound hope that following the political change-over that has taken place in my country, and out of loyalty to the Polish tradition of solidarity, Poland will observe the Charter of Fundamental Rights in full.

      <p sl="fr">As co-rapporteur on the new composition of the European Parliament, I am also pleased about the Council’s agreement with the motion for a resolution voted for by Parliament on 11 October. The Council has thereby approved the definition we gave for degressive proportionality, the translation of this principle into figures, the use of Eurostat figures to evaluate the populations to be taken into account and the desire to find a more stable system after 2009.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Council’s agreement is more than a 100% agreement; it is a 101% agreement, since the Council adds a seat to be given to Italy, without explaining why. This leads me to make two comments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first comment is, as you said, Mr President, that all the Members of Parliament will keep the right to vote – even the President, and even the 73rd Italian – contrary to a persistent rumour spread by some of the press.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second comment is that the 73rd seat granted to Italy departs from the principle of degressive proportionality written into the Treaty, proposed by Parliament and accepted by the Council. We must therefore make sure that the decision to apply Article 9 a is unassailable before the European Court of Justice and for this reason the rapporteurs will be proposing a revised draft to Parliament taking into account the European Council’s wishes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Is the Treaty perfect, then? Of course not! Jean Monnet has an answer for this too. On the Treaty of Rome, he wrote that he did not ask himself whether the Treaty could have been better as it corresponded to all that was possible at the time and to the wisdom of the age. 1957-2007. Are we taking the risk of starting again? No, of course not. There will be no third treaty. One crisis is enough. Two is too many. Jean Monnet again has the answer: ‘I have always thought that Europe would be made through crises and that it would be the sum of the solutions to those crises.’ That is what the Treaty is.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, obviously not everyone agrees, since our British friends are so keen on opting out. I live on a peninsula, so I understand island mentalities. However, Jean Monnet experienced this in 1951 with coal and steel. They were not interested, it was offered to them, and then they came on board. Remember Tony Blair. He signed the Social Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty. We are sure to find a British colleague to sign the Charter of Fundamental Rights one of these days. Let us be patient, and remember the Chinese diplomat who once said that he admired the wise slowness of the construction of Europe. Let us go on.</p>

The new European Union will be more capable of action, more democratic and more transparent and it will be in a position to discharge its duties more successfully both at home and throughout the world. This is good, and congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency in this regard. If I mention with pride that the German Council Presidency was there at the beginning of the road to Lisbon, I hope you will not mind my saying so, as a German.</p>
      <p sl="de">Not all the problems have been solved yet. The absurd episode surrounding the 751st seat mandate and the President’s voting rights made this clear. There should be no question at all of the Council not being authorised to remove an elected Member’s right to vote – irrespective of position. I am grateful that both the President as well as Parliament’s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference have quickly and palpably made this clear.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, there is a problem here. It concerns Parliament’s composition, which remains unclear as from 2014. I am convinced that it will involve finding a system that defines and governs Parliament’s composition according to objective criteria, irrespective of political caprice. It cannot be true that the Council effectively distributes Parliament’s seats as if it were lord of the manor. We have to strive towards this until 2014.</p>
      <p sl="de">One important advance has not perhaps been recognised sufficiently to date: the strengthening of the principle of subsidiarity. This is a very important step in involving national Parliaments in responsibility for European legislation as far as subsidiarity is concerned. Subsidiarity and the demand for it strengthen the Community and do not weaken it, Commission President. We shall also be striving for this in the future.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, welcome this agreement, which, despite a few oddities like the extra seat for Italy, is a good package that deserves ratification and will make the European Union function better, while also improving its democratic accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me dwell for my remaining minute on the second aspect. Mr Kirkhope asked just now whether we have answered the questions posed at Laeken about making the EU more democratically accountable and closer to its citizens. I would say that we have certainly moved in that direction. Let us remember one thing: once this Treaty comes into force, no European legislation can be adopted without, firstly, prior examination by every national parliament, secondly, the approval of the Council of Ministers composed of national ministers accountable to those very same national parliaments and, thirdly, approval by this European Parliament, with its Members directly chosen by citizens specifically to deal with European issues at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is a level of accountability that exists in no other international structure. Look at the World Trade Organisation. Look at the IMF. Look at the World Bank. Look at the OECD. You name it, nothing above the level of the nation state has that level of democratic accountability. Those who are really worried about democratic accountability in international structures should focus on those institutions and organisations.

      <p sl="pl">Moreover, it also fulfils the aims that were stated as an obligation in the Laeken Declaration six years ago. In line with those aims, the Treaty arranges and simplifies both the institutional framework and the legal system of the Union. It democratises the European Union, among other things by reinforcing the legislative role of our Parliament. It brings the Union closer to its citizens, and one way in which it does this is through the citizens’ initiative.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The question is, will the Union, as a result of the Treaty, have greater significance in the world and act more effectively? This, however, does not depend only on the institutions introduced or modified by the Treaty; it depends primarily on the political will of the leaders of the Member States. Should this will be lacking, all the institutional reform will have counted for nothing. In order that the Treaty does not remain a moribund law, a moribund document, I would like to appeal for a community of political will at the time of its signing and after its ratification.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the text of the Reform Treaty agreed at the Lisbon Summit is clear progress, a step forward in the history of European integration – I would like to call it European unification. Therefore, it should be greeted with satisfaction.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nonetheless, however important this step might be, it is not the last one. In the short term it is crucial to see the Treaty ratified by all the 27 Member States. It should now be clear to everybody that there was no plan B and there is no plan C. After ratification we must continue, in the medium and long term, with the necessary reforms and policies until a complete reconciliation between Europe’s history and geography is achieved within the framework of European transnational democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this moment of relief, it is also crucial to get rid of any democratic hypocrisy and demagogy and admit that, in this complex world, political management requires – more than ever – a professional competence which could not be the subject of referendums. We must ask the people to decide, by ‘yes’ or ‘no’, on principles and fundamentals, not on sophisticated technicalities and complicated compromises. For the rest, we must observe the principle of the non-imperative mandate.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, we must also admit that the progress we are celebrating today was achieved at the expense of transparency and sincerity.

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, as a former member of the Convention on the Future of Europe, as the only national parliamentarian involved in the negotiations and as a convinced opponent of the Constitution since the very beginning I am glad to say that in Lisbon common sense has prevailed, at least to some extent.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The very concept of a European Constitution was erroneous from the beginning. I am glad that it has been abandoned and I am glad that my country was among those who contributed to this. The EU is not a state, it will never be one and therefore it cannot have a constitution. It has to be built on an intergovernmental treaty, whereby the Member States, the national states, remain the corner stones of the whole process of European integration.</p>
      <p sl="cs">With regards to the content, each of us likes and dislikes certain aspects of it. On the one hand, I am personally delighted with the reinforcement of the role of the national parliaments and the national executives through the so-called flexibility clause. What I do not like, on the other hand, is a reduction of the national right of veto. However, being a realist I am aware that we have reached the limits of what is possible.</p>
      <p sl="cs">What I see as important, nonetheless, is the fact that for the very first time in history of the EU an artificial concept elaborated at the green table had to some extent to be reworked after being tested against reality. This leads me to hope that the EU will continue in the future to demonstrate that it can move away from certain concepts that prove to be unfit, such as, in my opinion, the 50-year-old obsolete federalist model. It leads me to hope that the EU will be able to move towards a genuine, flexible, decentralised intergovernmental organisation capable of coping with the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Mr President, I trust, however, that Parliament will not succumb to the temptation to revive the already dead constitutional idea, because it would merely illustrate that it is an ivory tower.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I did not think the last week would end so successfully.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, at the Lisbon Summit we adopted a new Reform Treaty, which is an enormous success, and I warmly congratulate Prime Minister José Sócrates, President Barroso and indeed all of us. It went off without any attempts to veto it or any additional battles over its final form. In my view that means that the European Union has emerged from its institutional crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, there is good news from my country, where the removal from power in recent days of an anti-European and far-right government is an undeniable success. The position of the Polish people is confirmation of what I have said many times – most Poles support European integration; Poles want Poland to be a partner, not an opponent, of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Such events undeniably instil optimism about the future of our common European project. I believe that the European Union is ready to meet the challenges of the future and, as Mr Sócrates correctly observed, the European Union is now a stronger and more internally cohesive structure, as well as being a decidedly more powerful partner in negotiations in international global relations. The positions of the President-in-Office of the Council and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy are a potent weapon which, if competently deployed, may positively strengthen the image of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the most important achievements of this agreement, moreover, is that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has acquired a legally binding character. I hope that the new Polish Government will withdraw the decision to exclude Polish citizens from the provisions of Chapter IV of the Charter, entitled Solidarity . This Chapter contains provisions relating to employee and trade union rights that are particularly dear to the Polish and European Left.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Portuguese Presidency on an excellent result under the circumstances. But there is one thing we need to keep in mind: the fundamental objective of the Convention on the Future of Europe is still to be accomplished, that is, to overcome the gap between institutions and European citizens. We now have the means to apply our common European policies. What we need is political will and determination. Everything now centres on implementation, and there are two principles on which our implementation of this Lisbon Treaty should be based: firstly, subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Defining the competences of the EU is clearly a very encouraging achievement, linked with the increased role and responsibility of the national parliaments, because our citizens should perceive that the European Community will address the problems of the Community efficiently and, at the same time, abstain from intervening in their lives where it is not necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second principle concerns solidarity, which is a core value of the European Community. Agreeing on degressive proportionality in forming the future European Parliament is a clear expression of that solidarity, and I am grateful for it. Another very important test of this solidarity will be creating the common foreign policy on energy security, as proposed last month by the European Parliament, including a special High Representative on energy serving under the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would quote one fine expression of solidarity when President Barroso told his Russian counterpart last May in Samara that, in the EU’s understanding of solidarity, Poland and Estonia are as important as Germany and Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, following the Lisbon Summit, the discussion of the European Treaty may be considered to be closed, as we now have one supreme aim – to ratify the Treaty as quickly and as efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Parliament does have a role to play here: please bear in mind that we have greater importance under the Treaty than we had before. There are three points to consider: the description of the role and tasks of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the matter of his election, this being a joint decision with the European Council from 1 January 2009. We need to prepare for this joint decision in several areas, primarily security and the administration of justice. Thirdly, we must hold a political debate to finalise the principles by which the President of the European Council will act, with particular reference to his relations with the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The most important thing, though, is ratification, and it depends to a large extent on us Members of the European Parliament. It will take place in different ways in each country. We must find ways of persuading citizens that this is a success not just for the Union, not just for politicians, but above all for them. This is our main task – ratification. Thanks and congratulations.</p>

    <intervention id="2-095" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Sócrates" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the excellent debate we have had on the summit and the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, say what you like about this new Treaty, but one thing no one can deny is that Europe is stronger as a result of this Treaty. This Treaty affirms European values, the good values that were always the foundation of the European integration project. This Treaty boosts the European economy and creates the conditions for Europe better to play its role in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As many have observed, this is a Treaty that makes the European institutions and the political workings of Europe more democratic. This Treaty equips the European Union of 27 for more effective decision-making. Those who like democracy also like democracy to be appreciated as a method that allows effective decision-making, and all those who follow European political life understand that Europe needed more effective decision-making.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I would like to say to anyone who has doubts about the Treaty and Europe’s capability, please wake up to reality; the world has already reached its conclusion on the Treaty. Europe has become stronger, better able to respond to global challenges, better able to respond to strategic challenges, and since Lisbon the world has been looking to Europe in the hope that it will once again take up its role in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">No, this Treaty means progress for us. Other people have already said it about Europe: no, do not doubt; wake up, we are stronger. Europe is more confident since the Lisbon Agreement and Europe is now in a position to take a stance on the future; it can move from the defensive to the offensive.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Graham Watson was kind enough to mention Pessoa in his speech. I would like to thank him very much for this personal kindness, as Pessoa is one of our great poets and I would like to quote Pessoa again: he once spoke about ‘a nostalgia for the future’. I too, as a European, am nostalgic for the future and I am nostalgic for the time when Europe discussed the future, showed leadership, and I am nostalgic for those days and I believe that this Treaty provides the conditions to enable Europe to do that.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If you will allow me, Mr President, I would like to clarify two things: the first is about the President of Parliament, to tell Members that it never entered anybody’s head that the Council might propose that the President of Parliament should lose the right to vote. The President will of course retain that right; I do not know how this mistaken idea arose, but what the Council decided is that this Parliament will have 751 Members (750 plus the President). Next I would like to say that the Ioannina clause has been resolved, as I always said it would be. Ioannina must be legally binding, but should not be in the Treaty, and the solution we came up with of a declaration plus a protocol is fully in line with the mandate we were given.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I too would like to praise the previous Presidency, as I have always done and always do in the same way. Throughout the whole process of this Treaty there were two decisive moments. The first came last October when Angela Merkel decided to make the Treaty the main issue of her Presidency and of future presidencies. This move required political courage and was a political risk. At the time no one thought it had much chance of success. I call this a decisive moment because Europe needed to get back to politics and also to get back to courage and political risk. The other decisive moment, as I said earlier, was when we decided, taking the opportunity of the last Council, to reach agreement in October rather than leave it for December.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, Mr President, I would like to finish by saying that certainly many people, and many people in Europe, who never believed in Europe are as dissatisfied with this Treaty as they would be with any other Treaty. However, perhaps there are some who would like a different Treaty and with them it is worth having a dialogue, to tell them that at this point the alternative was either to have this Treaty or to remain in a state of institutional crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I think that all who realise that a politician has to deal with reality rather than with fantasy will support what was decided in Lisbon. As for ratification, I would like to be clear that it is the business of each country. However, what I cannot accept as a democrat is for those who argue for national referendums to do so by trying to diminish representative democracy, challenging the legitimacy of parliamentary ratification.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pt">I am a democrat and Europe is democratic, and being democrats we leave each country free to decide the best method of ratification.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yes, I am very proud, yes I am very satisfied, yes, I feel very honoured to have been part, along with many others, of a historic and decisive moment, the moment in which the Lisbon Treaty was born, because it means that Europe will move forward.</p>

    <intervention id="2-097" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Ms Thyssen asked a specific question: can we make progress between now and the final ratification? As I said, it is by delivering results to European citizens that we can help to create the right political environment to facilitate ratification.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be a mistake to slow down our delivery, and it would be against the twin-track strategy central to the Commission, which stated that we should at the same time solve the political institutional matters and deliver concrete results to our citizens. On the contrary, this Commission, and I am sure also this Parliament, should be active – and we could be even more active together – in promoting a European citizens’ agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second issue concerned communication and democracy. Communicating about a treaty and explaining it to our public is primarily the responsibility of the national authorities. However, it is also a task for the European Institutions. I agree with what Mr Queiró said about the importance of the role of the European Parliament in this matter. We in the Commission are ready to assume our responsibility in close cooperation with Member States and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with the points made about subsidiarity by Mr Kelam and Mr Nassauer. It is very important to highlight the added value, in terms of democracy, of this Treaty. It makes Europe more democratic and more accountable and places a stronger emphasis on subsidiarity. Subsidiarity is a way to reinforce Europe and the European Institutions, not to weaken those Institutions, because by working close to the citizens they get more legitimacy and can take better decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also believe that it is right in our communication, as Mr Corbett highlighted, to explain the new democratic dimension. We in the European Union are proud to have this kind of democratic system. We can always make it better, but there is no other place in the world where there is such democratic participation at transnational level as the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also, in communication terms, make clear our reinforced capacity to act on behalf of the citizens in areas relevant to their concerns, like climate protection, energy and migration. Those are concrete concerns for our citizens and we are addressing those concerns. In communication terms, we should also highlight the reinforced capacity to act in the international scene.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to highlight one point that was made clear by Mr Poignant and I thank him for highlighting the importance of Jean Monnet. It is true that this is not a perfect Treaty, but sometimes people say we are giving up the values and the commitment of the founding fathers. That is not true. We are doing what Jean Monnet and many others have said, which is to build pas à pas – step by step – this common project, and we have to do it by conceding now that we have to commit to our citizens, and that we have to fulfil concrete tasks and deliver concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Lisbon Summit, in concentrating on the Treaty and the Institutions and, on the second day, showing the way to globalisation, and the way we can together reinforce our capacity to act so that we can meet the challenge of globalisation, has indeed set the agenda for the future of Europe. It was therefore a great success, and the Portuguese Presidency, the Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission should really celebrate this fact and look to the future with renewed confidence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">My first words will be to congratulate the leaders of the Member States for the historic agreement they entered into in Lisbon, which brings to an end many years of institutional uncertainty. I welcome the relentless work of daring, wisdom and pragmatism of the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and Angela Merkel’s excellent German Presidency in the first half of 2007 of which put the institutional agenda on the rails. I would like to include in these congratulations recognition of the excellent and immense work accomplished by chairman Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. This agreement picks up the major political advances of the old text: a stable presidency for the European Union, a person responsible for European diplomacy, and a new voting mechanism with the extension of qualified majority voting, while strengthening the powers of the European Parliament. I am sorry that the symbols of the European Union (the flag, anthem and motto) have been abandoned. This Treaty also takes account of the messages delivered by the French and Dutch people who rejected the old Treaty, in that it does not retain the character of a constitution, which the original text had, and it does not set in stone in the Treaties of the European Union a collection of European public policies that instead come under the current functioning of European democracy.</p>

    <intervention id="2-100" speaker_id="28637" name="Alexandra Dobolyi" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="hu">I consider it to be a major step that the politicians who were present in Lisbon, conscious of their responsibility and setting aside their historical grievances, have reached agreement on a Treaty that has taken six long years to produce, and which will determine the future face of Europe and establish a framework enabling it to function efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is important that the process of ratifying this document, due to be signed on 13 December this year, also goes without a hitch in the Member States. It is vital that the European Parliament should continue to pledge its support for the Reform Treaty, and here again we draw Member States’ attention to the importance of the ratification process.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungary has always firmly supported the constitutional process and believed that sooner or later the Member States would find a common voice and succeed in moving the process of European integration forward.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As a member of the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, I believe it is important to emphasise that the document that has been adopted can contribute positively to making European Union foreign policy more effective, and can also enhance its effectiveness in the international diplomatic arena. It is not only in the realm of foreign policy, however, that the Reform Treaty may be expected to bring about change, but also on numerous other issues that are vital for the efficient functioning of the EU. For example, it opens up the possibility that the new European Parliament and European Commission that will be constituted in 2009 will be able to commence operations on a more efficient, more transparent and more democratic basis.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This joint success first and foremost required the political will to take joint action, so let us now rejoice in the Treaty, but in the interests of ensuring the success of the process we must not stop here; we must continue in our joint efforts to ensure that the ratification process is brought to a successful conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="nl">In order to reach agreement on the Reform Treaty, too many gifts were handed out behind closed doors in Lisbon: Italy receives an extra seat in the European Parliament and Bulgaria the Cyrillic ‘evro’, Poland can continue to block the decision-making process for a number of years to come, and Austria can exclude German students from its universities. This horse trading is medieval and runs counter to our endeavours towards greater transparency in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nevertheless, we can be pleased that at long last, following years of debate, we have reached an agreement full stop, as this Treaty is an improvement on the current situation. It is not the most elegant of agreements, but it does ensure more democracy in Europe. It gives the European Parliament and national parliaments more influence, enabling European citizens to exert more direct influence on policy. It meets the need for common energy and foreign policies. Rigorous enforcement of the Copenhagen criteria is a necessity, and finally more democratic accountability is also afforded by the introduction of the ‘orange card’, which gives national parliaments the opportunity of contesting European legislation on grounds of subsidiarity.</p>

      <p sl="en">The truth about the Reform Treaty is the same as that about the European Constitution. These deeds transform the international organisation that is the European Community, as well as the union between its members that is the European Union, into a continental superstate. They also effect a recognition of this superstate (by accession to the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950, the parties to which may only be states). They open up a new path for the creation of a single European law without the involvement of the Member States (through interpretation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights by the European Court of Justice). One could spend a long time listing examples of equivalent significance.</p>
      <p sl="en">In view of this situation, we come up against the issue of guarantees of the rights of the peoples of Europe in the new superstate, since it has so far been the Member States that constituted these guarantees for their peoples. This problem has not been addressed at all in the Reform Treaty. Since the rights of peoples are none other than human rights raised to the level of community life, because of the project to establish a superstate we are facing a human rights crisis in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must therefore reject the Reform Treaty and set about doing some fundamental work on a system to guarantee the rights of peoples under the conditions of European integration. If we do not do this, Europe will be threatened by another explosion of totalitarianism.</p>

However, in this House there are rules of procedure, not just because we want to torment people, but because large groups with way over 200 members also have problems, which you have perhaps to a lesser extent, Mr Cohn-Bendit, in your smaller group, namely that we have to be able to consult one another.

      <p sl="en">Rule 37(1) concerns the access to documents and provision of information to this Parliament. In the run-up to this vote on pesticides, many, if not all, in this House have been bombarded by e-mails asking us to vote for amendments that go even further than the Commission would like us to. These e-mails come from an organisation called Pesticide Watch, whose constituent organisations received large amounts of funding from the European Commission – indeed, part of the EUR 11.7 million spent in the last two years under the budget line relating to the Community action programme promoting non-governmental organisations (NGOs) primarily active in the field of environmental protection and the Life+ programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">Under Rule 37(1), can I ask for the various exchanges between the Commission and these NGOs, who have been lobbying us on all these matters? This payroll lobbying has certainly led to an increase in the number of e-mails being received by MEPs, but surely it is wrong for one Commission DG to use large sums of taxpayers’ money, and abuse the role of NGOs, to try and change the views of parliamentarians and the lead Commission DG on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="el">The legislative regulations governing the protection of the environment are a compromise between the need to protect it and the demands of big business to maximize its excessive profits come what may. Preoccupation with profit makes the competitiveness of the EU’s multinationals a priority above all the others. The following are symptomatic of this:</p>
      <p sl="el">i. the Kyoto Protocol, in which trade in pollutants is prominent;</p>
      <p sl="el">ii. the entire legislative framework, which facilitates the use and expansion of GMOs;</p>
      <p sl="el">iii. legislation on the monitoring of the use of chemical substances in consumer products to a permissible level. This legislation took as many as 40 years to be completed, although it naturally has many exceptions, from 1967 (Directive 67/458/ΕEC) to 2007, when the REACH Regulation entered into force;</p>
      <p sl="el">iv. a still highly deficient legislative framework for the integrated management of radioactive waste;</p>
      <p sl="el">v. the distorting development of biofuels, at the expense of food crops.</p>
      <p sl="el">Multinationals are nonetheless allowed to act anti-environmentally. All they suffer are some fines, which represent a very small part of the additional profits coming from the destruction of the environment. This proves the adage that he who pays the piper calls the tune.</p>

I voted in favour of both resolutions and consider them to be very important EU legislative documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a shame that the launch of SIS II keeps being postponed. We are so far behind schedule that it is essential to find a way out of the situation that would enable us to use the SIS 1+ network after 13 November 2008, i.e. to extend the service provided by the SISNET network and to create a fall-back solution with the s-TESTA network.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of SIS II will have to be shared between the three projects being developed simultaneously: SIS II, SISone4all and the installation, operation and management of a communication infrastructure. This will have a negative impact on the implementation of SIS II.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the decision on the financing of SIS 1+ and subsequently SISone4all will be of great importance: will it be financed by all participating parties or will SISNET, for example, receive funding from the EU budget? The correct distribution of EU and Member States’ resources will be of great significance. However, in view of the project’s importance as regards the security of the EU, it is obvious that SIS II is the greatest priority. We must allocate funds for EU security and the development of communications infrastructure.</p>

I welcome the voting of the decision to mobilize the fund, which represents a first attempt to support our European citizens who face the challenges of globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Globalisation is a phenomenon that offers us numerous chances and opportunities, but also generates difficulties of adjustment to its consequences. Therefore, it is very important for the European Union to be capable not only of responding to such challenges, but also to approach them efficiently by fast mobilization of the necessary financial instruments. European citizens’ safety and confidence in the future lie at the basis of our actions and initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am very pleased to welcome the orientation of this fund toward the field of labour and labour safety, but I also emphasize the importance of education in this field and the need to take into consideration this area, as well, in the future fund mobilizations. At the end, I hope that in the future, in case of need, each EU Member State will benefit from the mobilization of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, whose less positive effects affect us all, including in the new Member States.

      <p sl="en">Owing to the budgetary restrictions on this fund (EUR 500 million a year), its restrictive eligibility criteria and the number of workers affected, the amount of the Community contribution awarded was EUR 3 816 280.

      <p sl="en">The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund came into being in 2006 under the considerable influence of the defeat of the constitutional referendum in France. Right from the start the impression was created that this was a compensation formula, linked more to the exaggerated problem of the ‘delocalisation’ of jobs to new Member States than to the problem of globalisation. As such, the Fund is a response to the fears associated with the enlargement of the European Union, essentially reinforcing them and blocking the benefits arising from the uniting of Europe in 2004 for new and old Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is no surprise that we are starting with an application from France, linked to the difficulties experienced by Peugeot and Renault suppliers, for a sum of EUR 3.8 million. The application is properly grounded and has received full support from the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will not become a method of typical rent-seeking, in other words an easy method of obtaining EU subsidies for businesses that are experiencing difficulties, allocated on the basis of criteria that are not very precise.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I feel very disappointed that Parliament has not done more today on this pesticides package. On so many of the more radical and progressive issues, we could have gone very much further. But the one area that I want to focus on just now is the area of residents. They should be regarded as a specifically vulnerable group, an exposure group in their own right, and a small step has been taken today in order to do that, in the vote that we have just had in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">People who live near schools where nearby fields are sprayed and people who work or live near sprayed fields have an enormously high exposure to pesticides. They are exposed, on a long-term basis, to mixtures or cocktails of pesticides that are sprayed in their locality throughout the year and, in many cases, for decades.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until now there has not been any protection for residents as a specific exposure group. This is a major and serious public health issue, as farmers clearly cannot control pesticides once they are airborne, and studies have shown pesticides can travel in the air for miles. I wish we had gone further in terms of our ban on all aerial spraying.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been many reports over the decades of acute and chronic ill-health in rural areas. Our Parliament could have done much more in this vote today to protect people from cancers, from leukaemia, from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and a whole range of other diseases, and I am very disappointed indeed that we did not take up that option, which had been put forward in the Committee on the Environment. So many of those more positive measures have, sadly, been overturned by the other groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I hope that people will look at the Parliament today and put pressure on their representatives so that, when we come back to a second reading, we can try and do better by the health of people.

There is specific mention of national action plans in the context of a reduction in the frequency of application of pesticides by 25% over 5 years and by half – by 50% – over 10 years. It is very important for the European Parliament to be tougher on this matter and have a greener approach than the European Commission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">As draftsman of the opinion on water quality, I saw that pesticides were implicated in the degradation of the environment, and particularly of surface and coastal waters, because they persist over time, can be transported over long distances, and constitute a diffuse form of pollution, which is difficult to locate resulting from runoffs, direct losses in the soil and the air, the washing of plants by the rain and so on. More generally, the current use of pesticides in our agriculture can have damaging consequences for our health. The Commission’s legislative proposals on the use of pesticides, and procedures for authorisation and placing on the market were therefore very keenly awaited.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I find the targets inadequate and that is why, in Parliament’s plenary, I unsuccessfully supported the position adopted by the Committee on the Environment asking for an EU target of a 25% reduction in the frequency of application of pesticides within 5 years and a 50% reduction within 10 years, and buffer zones of 10 metres between fields and water courses.

      <p sl="pt">However, I consider it essential for the possibility of aerial spraying to be maintained in situations where there is no viable alternative or where terrestrial application involves a greater hazard, although in Natura 2000 areas, in addition to the possibility of pesticides being banned, it should also be possible to restrict their use or minimise the risks involved, which presupposes a specific risk assessment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Now, the rapporteur considers the title of the Commission proposal to be misleading.

We have a collective responsibility for precluding risks, and it is indeed true that in the use of pesticides, ‘the fewer the better’, but the rules must be realistic and workable. If alternatives are available, they must be used, but it is wishful thinking to ban all uses of pesticides by law and think that this will be without consequences for our economy and society.</p>

      <p sl="en">This lunchtime, the European Parliament has overall delivered a message that responds to the concerns of citizens in favour of agriculture being less dependent on pesticides, sustainable and taking account of the health of farmers and other users.</p>
      <p sl="en">One step forward is the health protection section, which was totally absent from the 1991 regulation and is now clearly affirmed through recognition of the substitution principle (as for REACH, aimed at encouraging the use of less or non-chemical alternatives), the priority given to the protection of the most vulnerable populations and the prohibition in principle on aerial spraying.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was essential to plug a legal loophole regarding the phase of use by professionals and private individuals. This will be achieved with the framework directive, which takes account of new habits and fashions in gardening: pesticides have even got into our homes and gardens!</p>
      <p sl="en">One major regret, though, is the rejection in the Klaß report of the new approach by the Commission – known as Integrated Pest Management – which consists of allowing the use of all available agricultural techniques while giving priority to environmentally-friendly ones. I am sticking to my guns: integrated production is common sense applied to the agriculture of the 21st century.</p>

      <p sl="de">The proposed Directive establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides is important, since alarming quantities of certain pesticides are still being found despite the existing framework regulations on soil, air and water. Evidence beyond the existing regulations also gives cause for concern in arable crops and requires a political initiative. National action plans with concrete objectives for reducing the risks and dependencies associated with pesticides are crucial here. It is extremely regrettable that in plenary we have not followed up the amendment with the objective of reducing alarming toxic and highly toxic substances by 50% by 2013 and reducing the use of pesticides by 20% in the next 10 years. This would have been an important political signal even in the given situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Each country will be obliged to draw up its own plan following the guidelines defined in the Directive. Each country should do so taking due account of local determinants and respecting any differences.</p>
      <p sl="en">The principal difference between us is the level of agricultural development. The countries that are among the new EU Member States often have enormous deficits to make up, especially as regards the quality and health of the foodstuffs produced. A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries compared with their current level of use will backfire on us consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also differ in our landscapes. In Poland, vast stretches of woodland may only be protected against pests by treatment applied from the air. It is our duty to the natural environment to protect the forests, while Parliament’s task is to define the principles for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Directive has much to say about the education of farmers being the most important way of implementing the sustainable use of pesticides. It is parliament’s task to Support education and create the conditions whereby it will reach every farmer.</p>

      <p sl="sv">A mixed message is being sent today. I think the most bizarre part today was Mr Heaton-Harris’s attack, which claimed that voluntary groups are trying to influence Parliament. The big thing that has happened is that Parliament’s position has been weakened as a result of extensive lobbying by lobbyists in the pay of industry, which puts its interest in selling more pesticides ahead of protecting public health and consumers. Fortunately they have not been entirely successful. We still have the pesticide passport, which gives consumers a reasonable opportunity to see what they are swallowing by asking their dealers. This protection is important and we must fight for it when we negotiate with the Council. However, Parliament did not protect residents as the Environment Committee wanted. They have worse protection and receive worse information than the committee wanted. This must be rectified in other readings. In my view we cannot continue authorising the most dangerous chemicals at the present level. Parliament has now avoided general reduction targets for all pesticides, which is unfortunate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I would like to say that we in the Green Group have now got through a report which can essentially be used for good negotiations with the Council, but there the name becomes a little silly. Just like calling the constitution a reform treaty, it is remarkable that Parliament is dubbing pesticides plant protection products. If all plant protection products were concerned, we could just as easily include fences in the legislation because they offer protection against roe deer. This shows how absurd plant protection products is as a name.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Links to other policies should be brought out more clearly. For instance, the regulation should not run counter to the aims and quality standards of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and its daughter directives. This must be ensured by regular checks.</p>

It is essential that we break up the monopoly of large multinationals in the field of data sharing and access, and open up the sector to increased and fairer competition. On the other hand, this sector is affected by geographical and environmental differences, which must be given due consideration.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In view of this, the EU has decided to modify its legislation with a view to encouraging a reduction in the use of pesticides. Within the framework particularly of the Breyer report concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and the sustainable use of pesticides, I voted in favour of setting up strict criteria for all toxic substances (neurotoxic, bioaccumulative, carcinogenic, etc.) Similarly, out of consistency with France’s National Pesticide Plan and REACH, I also supported a 50% reduction by 2013 in the use of extremely worrying pesticides and the replacement of the most dangerous substances with safer substitutes (including non-chemical products). Finally, in conformity with the spirit of the national debate in France on the environment, I voted in favour of a tax on pesticides to encourage our farmers to reduce their use of treatment products.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first I wish to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee’s members and coordinators for making it possible for us to reach an excellent compromise in a very positive atmosphere. Parliament’s Secretary-General was also very open and cooperative when the budget was being drafted. It is a good start to future cooperation between the administration and the Committee on Budgets.</p>
      <p sl="fi">First of all I want to say that this system of two organisations deciding on the budget – the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets – cannot continue in the future. It is not the right approach to have the Bureau developing various new ideas and new projects. The Committee on Budgets is either a kind of rubber stamp approving the funds, or it is a bad boy or girl who cuts them out. That was the case here too, when there were major new increases proposed by the group chairmen, which would have gone over the famous 20% ceiling which has been jointly agreed. I do hope that people will listen to the Committee Chairman’s guidelines on this, because he has the right idea about how this process should be gone about in the proper way, in order to achieve concrete and fitting results. These matters cannot be decided in two places. It is much better if they are decided in just one.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When Parliament’s budget was being drawn up, the administration and the Bureau showed the right initiative in proposing that remaining under the 20% ceiling should be a basic principle. Afterwards, the group chairmen made additions to the policy rules. One was that each Member’s assistants should receive a thousand euros more a month, making around EUR 10 000 000 in all, and there were various other increases, when in fact we had got into a situation where extra expenditure had to be cut to some extent. This is obviously never easy, but it needs to be said that we have not made any real savings or cuts; instead, we just tried to adhere to budgetary discipline when it came to new increases, so that the budget would not grow too large.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is obviously important because we are spending taxpayers’ money. We should think about what projects we should engage in and which of them are acceptable, from the taxpayer’s point of view. Above all, we need to concentrate on the essential work which we have been elected to do here. This is a legislative body, and so we should not be implementing projects that lie outside the scope of actual legislative work.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Let me say, however, that I happy with the joint compromise allowing Parliament an increase of just under 4%. That is reasonable, and in any case includes many projects which other Members here are in favour of.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I will mention some of these projects. First, there is information policy, which is extremely important. For this, an additional EUR nine million has been added to the reserve, to be spent on the new Web TV when the prototype has been approved. This Web TV idea as a technical information channel is an acceptable notion, but it should not be put into effect in the way that is now being suggested. The political groups and the Members are not to take part in monitoring the body concerned or in the everyday work involved. The administration does not have the same sort of political honesty that people want to see as the political groups and the Members do.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I have found it very hard to appreciate the idea which has been proposed by the left that politics should be expunged from policy and that information on Parliament can come only via its administration, and not through its Members or political groups. It is inconceivable to allow information policy to come only via the administration, and it leaves us, who have been elected to this place democratically, outside the information machinery.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another idea connected with this subject was that concerning the local media, which was decided in plenary just before the holidays. It was that Members should get a bit more money for inviting representatives of the local media to observe what is happening in Parliament and to interview them. The Committee on Budgets voted against this. I do not understand this apparent animosity towards the small local media coming from the left, as it allows us to get as close as we can to ordinary people. Now we in the Committee on Budgets, however, have voted against this money by a majority, and we Members cannot spend any more money on inviting the local media here.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Thirdly, I would like to mention the Information Offices. Each Member State has its own Information Office, which is a good thing, but why buy the most expensive buildings in the most expensive areas? Why could we not buy slightly cheaper buildings a bit further out of town and spend the relevant funds on human resources? We need more people to visit places of work, places of study and schools to tell people what Parliament does and why. That is the best way to influence people, to go to them, and not buy costly buildings. This money could be better spent.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As for the policy on buildings generally, I hope that all the institutions can together establish a common organisation to consider when and where to build and when and where to purchase property, so that we do not make decisions without knowing what others are doing and artificially raise property prices.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I just want to comment on the resolution on the proposal to reduce the number of sittings in Strasbourg. This might be something of an eternal debate, but it has to go on until something gets done. We also have to set an example in the reduction of emissions. We cannot squander EUR 200 million of taxpayers’ money a year. We must show the public that the EU has enlarged and changed, and for this we have to change. I have not come across one good explanation as to why this hassle has to continue. For that reason, I hope that we will have a vote on the subject so that Parliament can negotiate with the Council and so that the much needed change can take place.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Once again I want to thank the coordinators and members of the Committee on Budgets for the compromise, and I hope that it will be preserved in the vote here on Thursday and that the figures concerned will remain just as we have jointly agreed.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union budget for 2008 is the second in this programming period. When the current financial framework was adopted, special priority was given to strengthening competitiveness and cohesion for growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission’s preliminary draft budget was EUR 129.2 billion for commitment appropriations and EUR 121 billion for payment appropriations. The Council in its draft budget cut commitment appropriations to EUR 128.4 billion and payment appropriations to EUR 119.4 billion, that is to say EUR 10.3 billion under an already very tight financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Council’s draft budget also highlighted other questions. Under heading 1 (sustainable growth and employment), payment appropriations were cut by a full EUR 1 046 million, although it was an unconditional priority of budget policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This autumn, Parliament also received the Commission’s letter of amendment proposing an additional EUR 262 million for external actions. Furthermore, the Commission also proposed a review of the financial framework so that adequate funds could be set aside for the Galileo global positioning system and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology for the period 2008-2013. The proposal was consistent with Parliament’s resolution adopted on 20 June and the first reading on the EIT legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Based on these criteria, the Committee on Budgets drafted its own proposal, which is now under discussion. Its key elements are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="fi">The budget’s unconditional priority is heading 1 (sustainable growth and employment). Commitment appropriations have been increased, in particular for research and training under the Lisbon Strategy and for the Trans-European Networks.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Heading 1a also relates to funding for the Galileo navigation system. When the multiannual financial framework was being drawn up, Parliament warned that Galileo was under-funded. Now it has a deficit of EUR 2.4 billion euros, because private industry is unwilling to get involved in the project, as has happened in the United States of America. Because the project is politically and economically important for Europe, Parliament insisted that it should go ahead and that it should be financed out of the EU budget. A decision on this needs to be taken during this budgetary procedure. For this reason, the draft budget had Galileo and its associated EIT appropriations outside the scope of the budget, in the form of a ‘satellite change’ proposal. A condition of its adoption is that the Commission proposal for amending the multiannual financial framework be adopted. If that does not happen, the Galileo project will fail and EIT funding will also be in difficulties. It is pointless continuing to finance Galileo if the Council does not have the genuine will to see it through to the end.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund appropriations under heading 1b have been substantially strengthened, as the unpaid commitments under the funds – the RALs – are alarmingly high, at more than EUR 95 billion.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Back in the summer, Parliament and the Council made a joint declaration regarding the Commission’s slowness to approve functional programmes. At present, 63% of the programmes under the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund remain unapproved, as do 83% of European Social Fund programmes and 75% of rural development programmes, even though the first programme year is already coming to an end.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The slowness of this administration seriously threatens the EU’s structural and cohesion policy and, in particular, the reconstruction of the new Member States, as the current financial framework is a massive European reconstruction project, bigger than the Marshall Plan after the Second World War. In this draft budget, however, just EUR 22.1 billion and EUR 5.3 billion have been set aside for structural measures and rural development respectively for the new Member States. Accordingly, the Committee on Budgets is proposing that a portion of the Commission’s relevant administrative costs should be placed in reserve, to be released as and when programmes are approved, because this process needs speeding up.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Another huge problem area relates to heading 4 (EU as a global partner). The preliminary draft budget was clearly inadequate, owing to which the Commission in its letter of amendment proposed EUR 120 million for Kosovo and EUR 142 million for Palestine. The Council also proposed increases of EUR 260 million for the same regions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Committee on Budgets adopted the Commission’s approach, but added a further EUR 10 million for both Kosovo and Palestine. To defend Parliament’s own priorities, the Committee also drafted an ‘asterisk’ amendment. It agrees a cut of EUR 40 million, which otherwise would have to be made in the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as the increase the Council proposed is an obvious area of interest for them and would jeopardise Parliament’s priorities. The asterisk proposal also incorporates the increases called for by the Committee on Foreign Affairs for Palestine and Kosovo, a total of EUR 40 million, plus a smaller adjustment of EUR 7 million for the Global Health Fund and certain other lines. This amendment can be adopted if the Council agrees to use the flexibility instrument.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Concerning the decentralised agencies, may I say that the Committee restored the EUR 32 million in cuts made by the Council and the personnel cuts. We thought that cooperation went relatively well. The most substantial change related to the border control agency, Frontex, appropriations for which were increased by EUR 30 million. Cooperation in the field of border control and strengthening it is one of Parliament’s key priorities.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The theme of this budget is ‘a budget for results’. It aims to promote both activity-based budgeting and activity-based management. To this end, EUR 49 million of the Commission’s general administrative costs has been placed in reserve, to be released as and when the Commission makes proposals for studies and reports, as requested by Parliament, on the development of activity-based management, the clarification of staff accountability, and the future trend in staff numbers. This also has to do with the declaration on executive agencies adopted in Parliament’s conciliation meeting. It states that each new proposal must contain a cost-benefit analysis compared with the situation where the measures would be the Commission’s responsibility. In addition, lines of accountability and responsibility in respect of the agency and the Commission should be clearly set out, and there must be an explanation of how the Commission is to take responsibility for the work of the agency and the use of funds. We know the warning examples from history of the ‘Technical Assistance Offices’.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The sum total for the draft budget before us is EUR 129 680 billion, which is EUR 623 million under the multiannual financial framework. Payment appropriations are EUR 124 194, which is the equivalent of 0.99% of the Member States’ GNI. The figure is EUR 5 300 million under the financial framework, and so the Committee on Budgets has shown great discipline in drawing up this proposal for deliberation by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The draft budget was prepared in a spirit of strong consensus and excellent cooperation. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Reimer Böge, for his excellent leadership, and the coordinators and shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups. They have shown considerable flexibility and an ability to cooperate. I also want to thank the Commission, and, in particular, Commissioner Grybauskaite, for showing a positive attitude, and also the Portuguese Presidency, which in tripartite negotiations and conciliation demonstrated a constructive attitude and deference. Finally, I want to express my appreciation and gratitude to the Committee on Budget’s secretariat and the administrators responsible for the budget in my own group and the other political groups for the enormous amount of work they have done.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I now submit the 2008 budget for deliberation by the plenary session.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr Virrankoski for an excellent report and for the substantial amount of work he has done on it.</p>
      <p sl="de">He rightly says that 2008 is year two in a seven-year financial perspective. It is my belief that this budget is moving in the right direction to offer value for money and with payment appropriations this year set at 0.99% GNI, it has the potential to achieve far better implementation in the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, in order to achieve these goals, I call on the Council, in particular, to take note of Parliament’s views and to be prepared to discuss some of the issues further, and I mention four issues at this point.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, Galileo and the European Institute of Technology (EIT): Parliament has given its approval to these schemes, but we still need evidence of budgetary discipline from the other institutions, and I make here three points. Firstly, I see insufficient evidence of provision for cost over-runs and late delivery of the projects. Secondly, I see insufficient evidence of very clear lines of accountability and responsibility with these major items, particularly where contracts for work on the projects are being awarded. Finally, I believe that the Commission should do far more to share its vision for the Galileo project and particularly the post-development phase of the project and the on-going situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, under Heading 4, we already know that demand for funding for Palestine and Kosovo will extend the margin under this heading quite considerably. This in part has been met by a reduction in funding for the CFSP. But that will inevitably create problems during the next year and I think that some time after Parliament’s first reading we will need to have discussions with the Council and the Commission to see how we can address that situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I call on the Council to support Parliament’s efforts to oblige the Commission to comply with the screening exercise and to achieve greater efficiency in staffing levels. This includes the decentralised and external agencies, where I fear there is need for far greater levels of accountability.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, it is most important that both the Council and the Commission attach far greater urgency to the achievement of a positive déclaration d’assurance from the Court of Auditors. In my view, their current rate of progress is unacceptably slow and, in consequence of this, the credibility of this House is seriously undermined. I therefore call on the Council, in particular, to show far greater urgency to address this situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank the whole of the budget team for the work they have done, especially our two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä. This budget procedure confirms the narrowness of the multiannual financial framework. The amount of payments, at less than EUR 130 billion, or 0.99% of GDP, is very skimpy and cannot support hopes for the development of European policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The teamwork in the Committee on Budgets means that the budgetary priorities of the political groups can be maintained, but the financial framework prevents the revival of the growth policies promised to European citizens. Our committee took particular care over the choices made by all the parliamentary committees, but the proliferation of pilot projects is evidence of the frustration with the niggardly nature of this financial framework. Once again, we have had to fight drastic cuts by the Council and I am happy with the compromise secured. The Commission still needs to execute this budget correctly. We will no longer put up with this draft budget being denatured through failures to execute and transfers of appropriations back to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, in the 2008 budget, we do not accept the failure to use the cohesion funds. In the Socialist Party, we have restored the Council’s dreadful cuts that affected programmes such as Culture 2007, Media 2007 and Youth in Action. I do not need to remind you here of the importance of these lines as the new Treaty is being put to the people of Europe. I invite the Council to think about this; for example, giving research or Frontex the resources they need to operate, and improving the lines of information correspond to the current concerns of European citizens. We are also proposing additional appropriations for certain new projects to improve the capacity to accommodate refugees or for NGOs fighting discrimination. The European budget absolutely must continue to help those fighting the scourges afflicting European society.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the EU’s external relations, we are reducing the expenditure of the CFSP by 40 million because we have to honour our commitments and the EU’s commitments: to preserve the emergency aid reserve, help the most disadvantaged countries, support the Global Fund to fight AIDS, the World Health Fund and maintain development aid. For Kosovo and Palestine, the flexibility instrument will need to be mobilised to provide EUR 87 million. It is still to be deplored that heading 4 is systematically underfunded. World poverty is growing and our budget is shrinking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the European Commission, I recognise that the reserve of EUR 40 million is harsh but it reflects our doubts over the effectiveness of implementing ABM. Allow me to give you a few examples: first of all, the failure to spend the cohesion funds, the impossibility of executing the pilot projects we hold dear, such as the Erasmus-style programme for apprentices, the lack of transparency in the choices of research firms, the poor implementation of selection competitions for new officials. The list is long and Parliament is asking to be convinced of the goodwill of the European executive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, the main one, the asterisk amendment demands that Galileo and the EIT are funded beyond the ceilings of the financial perspective. This necessitates, forces even, a mini-revision of the financial perspective. Parliament cannot accept the endangering of Galileo, a major challenge from a technological, economic and political point of view, and an essential strategic tool for the political powers and independence of the EU, but I am convinced of the value of Mrs Merkel’s comments in our chamber. On 29 June, Chancellor Merkel used this African proverb to close her Presidency: ‘If you want to go quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.’</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament for personally chairing this sitting and these proceedings, and for the fact that it is not taking place at midnight. I am very pleased about that.</p>
      <p sl="da">Commissioner, there is no doubt that the 2008 budget proceedings will be quite challenging. However, in Parliament we stand together, and when we vote on Thursday I am fairly convinced that there will be broad support for the strategy, the Committee on Budgets and the draftsman that Mr Virrankoski has selected for the Commission budget.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the Commission’s excellent proposals for the funding of the Galileo satellite surveillance system. We are in favour of surplus money from agricultural schemes being used for this project instead of being returned to the Member States. It would not be reasonable to reduce the funding for research and transport in order to find money for Galileo, as is being proposed by the EU Finance Ministers. If the EU Member States agree that we are to have Galileo, they must also provide the funding for it without using it for other purposes. As has already been mentioned by Mr Virrankoski, we have previously been warned that Galileo has not been allocated sufficient money; the situation that we are now facing therefore does not come as a surprise.</p>
      <p sl="da">The other significant controversial matter as regards the Council concerns the funds for foreign affairs policy. We are all extremely worried about whether enough money has been allocated to Kosovo and Palestine as well. I would like to thank Mr Virrankoski for his extensive efforts to find a compromise that enjoys broad support.</p>
      <p sl="da">With regard to the agencies, we are satisfied that the border monitoring agency Frontex is receiving more funding, and we hope that a solution can be found to enable the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to get started as quickly as possible with the LRIT Data Centre, which will be established by the end of 2008.</p>
      <p sl="da">The rapporteur for the other institutions, Mr Itälä, has had both an achievable task and a very difficult one. The difficult task was the Parliament budget, where it was unfortunately not possible to bring the expenses down to this year’s level plus inflation. However, in spite of this, it has been possible to keep the expenses below the 20% ceiling. The ALDE Group supported the original compromise between the rapporteur and the Bureau, and it is regrettable that poor coordination between the chairs of the larger groups meant that the compromise had to be reworked. We should not see this happen again; we can do better. However, I am not chastising Mr Itälä. He has made a good contribution, and I would also like to thank him for finding a reasonable solution for the Committee of the Regions, which has been subject to very severe cutbacks by the Council.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Does the second budget in the current budget perspective differ significantly from its predecessors, apart from in the size of the sums concerned? As ever, we have to continue the funding of expenditure from previous years, and we can change only parts of the budget. Such significant items are the funding of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the Galileo project. There is also increased funding for Palestine and Kosovo. Significant changes are also to be found in the funding of the common agricultural policy and specialist agencies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Are we making a big mistake in loosely matching sums to later expenditure? Is it feasible to do this one year in advance? We try, but we always have the opportunity to adjust the budget, and this is very important. Perhaps in future we should create more items, as that will add significant elasticity to the budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks to Mr Virrankoski. Despite the very difficult area concerned, it was a great pleasure to work with him.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by stating that we have a general problem with the existing financial perspective because, from the point of view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the budget we have until 2013 is not really adequate for the major challenges that Europe and the current 27 Member States are facing.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to state that I see within the Council a lack of European spirit where budgeting and finances are concerned. I think we need, as we have already declared with the Lisbon Strategy, a genuine high-tech offensive for Europe, if we really want to build the path towards the knowledge-based society. We are unfortunately running way behind on this. I also believe that we have to do even more for research and development as well as for lifelong learning if we want to make Europe’s citizens properly fit and give them the skills to cope with globalisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also have to create – and as all the polls show, the citizens of Europe are demanding this of us – a responsible foreign policy. If, however, we want to invest more in crisis prevention and responsible action in hot spots around the world, we need appropriate resources, which we currently do not have to an adequate degree.</p>
      <p sl="de">In relation to climate change policy, I also think that we have to show the world that well-understood climate change policy and selective growth go hand in hand. Europe must take a major step forward here, as it is only by persuading other continents and large countries like China and India and the United States that we can draw up policy on climate change and create new jobs that we shall also win over the hearts of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, I think that we can, of course, economise on the European budget, on agricultural export subsidies, for example, as well as in the cultivation of tobacco and also on the costs of our meetings here in Strasbourg. We can see that the budget is not adequate for our major, ambitious science projects like Galileo, the satellite navigation system. Many previous speakers have already said so. If we think this is politically correct, however, the Council must stir itself here, otherwise we shall lose contact with the United States, as well as with China and India. With regard to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, if we really want to show that Europe is a continent that genuinely values knowledge and wants to be a knowledge-based society, the Council will also have to do more here. A common European will is required here, if we are to promote Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I should like to thank all my fellow Members who have been collaborating on this budget. It is only a compromise, but a good compromise, at least on Parliament’s side, and one we shall be defending.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, there is probably a wide spectrum of opinion in all the groups. Some are happy with the Council’s strict budget policy, while other Members feel it is a barrier to achieving all that is good and fine. The fact is that the Council’s proposal for the budget total is incredibly low compared with combined national income and that Parliament’s proposal also represents an exceptionally low level of budgetary expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Our group is unhappy with the way the draft budget raises the Union’s military profile. Militarisation of the Union is also one of the reasons why our group cannot support the new constitution proposal agreed last week. The constitution, like next year’s draft budget, will do nothing to strengthen the Union’s social dimension.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We are used to the idea that the Commission never fully implements the EU budget, and the Member States are used to the idea that they will have their own resources, as they are known, returned to them every year. That will be due to the RALs resulting from delayed programmes under the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund this year and next. The rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, is speeding up the approval procedure for these programmes with good reason.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is our group’s view that it is right to amend interinstitutional agreements with regard to new expenditure for Galileo and the European Institute of Technology. There is not enough money in the budgetary framework; instead, the membership will have to bring new money to the Union for them. In this House, Parliament’s Bureau is not as disciplined in its budget targets as the Committee on Budgets. It is always trying to spend 20% of the EU’s administrative costs even if there is nowhere the money can justifiably be spent. Such projects include the memorial to Mr Pöttering, a museum dedicated to the EU’s short history, or converting Parliament’s parking area into a spa and baths.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At the same time, the Social Democrats, Liberals and Greens voted in the Committee on Budgets on the indulgent supervision of the party support funds of the Europarties and now also of the Euro-foundations financed out of Parliament’s budget. There was no clause stating that the use of funds should be overseen in accordance with the best practices of EU budgetary control. My compatriots Mr Virrankoski and Mr Ville Itälä have tried, in their role as rapporteurs, to achieve a balanced outcome.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you Mr President. The honourable Members Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä have dealt with the budgetary matters very competently. I have great respect for their work, within the given terms of reference. But that is the problem: they are forced to work within the given terms of reference. The EU’s budgetary process is profoundly outmoded and therefore beneath contempt.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The basic principle is always this: more money is coming in, so what are we going to invest it in? This is a 50-year-old organisation, which for that reason should focus on zero budgeting. We must ask the following question: if we were starting today (and not 50 years ago), what would we invest our budgetary resources in? Would we invest them in creating the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee of the Regions? Would we invest nearly half in a protectionist agricultural policy, in PR and marketing for products that could not otherwise be sold? Would we invest in subsidies for tobacco production, for producing tobacco that cannot be sold in the normal way, at the same time as we are by and large banning smoking in the EU? Would we invest in Structural Funds which take almost all the remainder of the entire budget, thereby deciding that countries can receive money centrally from the EU budget provided it goes to a certain kind of regional policy? The answer is – as I am convinced everyone sitting here in the building (which is not many) would say – no, we would not do that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The question is then: how can we approach the issue? Well, we cannot do it if we are not prepared to look at the fundamental budgetary issues from scratch and then to work from there. We are therefore in completely the wrong place. If we conduct a normal economic analysis and consider what should be done with budget funds at EU level that are spent through Brussels, it is allocating money that the Member States would not otherwise be able to invest, for example in basic research. We all know from economic theory that basic research is completely underfunded on the market. There are always freeloaders there. It is assumed that someone else will pay the costs of basic research and when it is all completed, it is available to us all. There are many such areas and an incredibly small amount of money goes there. We talk about it, but we do nothing. In most cases money goes to what was decided 30-50 years ago. That is scandalous. We also have an EU that is buying buildings around Europe in the belief that it is cheaper. That is an irresponsible way to act, speculating with taxpayers’ money. It should not continue. We must initiate a discussion on what the EU should do with the money we receive. What we are doing right perhaps takes 10-15% of all the funds. The rest goes to preposterous things, and to different kinds of PR work, such as the money for adaptation to globalisation. Individual states that compete with one another to find good institutional solutions are what created Europe and its success. Let us keep that. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">There is, of course, an attempt to be active and therefore to do something. Here I would address you directly, Mr President. The LUX film award has been set up. The conditions were that the films would be viewed by 18 October of this year and only those Members who had seen all three films could and should vote under this budget item initiative.

      <p sl="de">This relatively small problem on the scale of budgets, Mr President, can be carried over to so many other areas.

I wish to thank the chairman, Mr Böge, the main rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, as well as the coordinators of all the political groups for their most successful, coordinated and positive work to achieve consensus in the Committee on Budgets at first reading. All the lines proposed by the Commission were reinstated – many thanks for that.</p>
      <p sl="lt">For the establishment of practically all PDB lines, I would like to express my thanks to Parliament. I repeat this in English, in case of an inexact interpretation, because that is the most important part of my speech. At the same time, I would also like to say that, no matter how satisfied we are and our cooperation is, we still have some comments to make and say that still, in most cases, Parliament made reserves.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This is something we tackled last year, and the Commission was capable of tackling last year, and we will try to do our best to ensure that all conditions are met by the Commission, providing all the information necessary for you to be able to release the reserves before second reading.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like especially to mention the pilot projects, where, this year, Parliament took the initiative and practically used an enlarged number of new pilot projects and preparatory actions, which you propose. As usual, we will look carefully at each case and will present our opinion at the beginning of November through the so-called ‘executability letter’, which will come in time, well before conciliation and the second reading.</p>
      <p sl="lt">On executive agencies, which are the very large, enlightening item on our budgetary procedure this year, I would like also to stress the constructive framework set by the July conciliation between us and the overall issue of agencies. I would like also to thank Parliament, in particular Ms Haug, for her cooperation, especially in finalising the revision of working arrangements for executive agencies which we agreed recently.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The Commission will do its best to ensure, as an honest broker between the two budgetary authorities, and will try to have the best and balanced result between all of us for finding the budget, especially knowing and bearing in mind that we still have large problems to solve together, such as Galileo and the EIT, which is on the table after our proposal pending, mainly, the decision of the Council. We are satisfied at how Parliament tackled this question in the proposal and at first reading.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the financial ceiling for heading 4 is EUR 7.002 billion according to the multi-annual financial framework. The Council increased the Commission’s 2008 preliminary draft budget of EUR 6.672 billion to EUR 6.89 billion, mainly by adding additional amounts for Palestine and Kosovo. Parliament pointed out at an early stage that these funds could not be adequate because challenges that could already be foreseen had not been taken into account. Now we hear from the Council that much higher amounts are required, particularly in the area of security policy. Unfortunately, we are still not aware of any concrete proposals. We must, however, come to an agreement with the Council as regards CFSP. Let us therefore negotiate openly and honestly on the actual needs for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we have approved some EUR 250 million a year for the CFSP from 2007 to 2013, the shortfall in funding will already be apparent. Our costs for security policy are running almost according to the time frame.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another important subject is Palestine. In 2007 we are spending significantly more than estimated, up to EUR 400 million. We also need more money next year than the Commission and the Council have so far estimated. We cannot expect Parliament to introduce lower amounts into the budget, however, and to subsequently plunder other policies in the course of the year because there has been no serious planning.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nor is there yet any clarity regarding the precise allocation of the tasks relating to Kosovo and the budgetary needs for 2008. I know we will first have to wait for the exact mandate here.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, I should like to point to the political dialogue we shortly need to establish. The European Parliament has been fighting for this in negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework and to have it anchored in the Interinstitutional Agreement. This would be the right forum to tackle major developments in a constructive manner, in good time and on the basis of mutual trust. This would be the right context for preparing a review of the new financial instruments.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Development is making an effort to set priorities with its expenditure estimated in the budget. We know that development aid, therefore our aid for the poorest people on the planet, is not something that happens by a snap decision and the results appear from nowhere, but there are processes here and we must work continually on these processes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have emphasised that we want to combat poverty. This means we have to provide people with an education and ensure that they are healthy so that they are able to develop within their own environment, their own country. We have invested a great deal of money in the past to combat malaria, tuberculosis and Aids and we want to help these countries genuinely develop through preventive measures such as, for example, the abolition of small arms, land mines and ABC weapons by setting up a conflict prevention network and cross-border cooperation between the developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">It should not be the case here, however – and these are my two pleas to the Council and the Commission – that the Council – simply because a new topic appears on the agenda – says quickly: now we are starting to reorganise everything. We must help Kosovo and we must help Palestine, and we fully agree on this. We have to do this but we should not do it by extracting money from the poorest of the poor and by believing that we could detect something like continuity in this switchyard or that people outside might have the feeling that we are working on helping the poorest of the poor there in a really concentrated manner. New money needs to be forthcoming here and I know we are talking about our taxpayers’ money, but they have to be told this explicitly. If we do this, we shall also be successful.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second item is directed at the Commission. You know exactly what our priorities are for combating poverty. I have just referred to them: provision of health care and basic education so that people are able to earn something themselves at home. We have put a great deal of money into the reserve and we shall not release this money until you have made it clear that you have accepted and adopted Parliament’s priorities.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not micromanagement that we want to introduce, but we have made a political evaluation, which you have agreed. We shall insist on it and implement it so that, as in other cases of foreign policy it, too, becomes reality and we shall therefore avail of our budget rights and opportunities to exert the appropriate pressure on you.</p>

We need to be able to promote European goods in third countries. We need to have experts who help our companies to enter foreign markets but, at the same time, we need to help developing countries export to the EU. Without trade there is no long-term sustainable development. The WTO has been criticised recently for its lack of transparency. The parliamentary dimension of world trade talks is an important initiative we should continue to support because it improves dialogue, gives greater legitimacy and allows for greater oversight.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a final note, I urge the Commission to make sure that Parliament is informed in due course of any projects of microfinancial assistance so that a proper debate can be held in the relevant committees, and that we as an institution are well aware of beneficiary countries spending EU money.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Budgetary Control has focused its opinion for the 2008 Budget on two fundamental points:</p>
      <p sl="es">The first is compliance with paragraph 44 of the new Interinstitutional Agreement relating to the statement of assurance and the annual certification that has to be sent by every Member State. In this amendment we are taking up the conclusions and recommendations of the 2004 and 2005 discharge, which a minority of Member States have already applied, but we believe more should do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">We know that the European Commission cannot evaluate the extent to which Member States have complied with this commitment until 15 February. However, and perhaps in order to encourage the European Commission to continue with this evaluation without wasting any time, we have introduced a reserve in the Commission’s staff costs. We are sure that the Commission has as much interest as Parliament does in ensuring that the Member States fully apply paragraph 44 in the area of shared management. I am therefore certain that we will reach an agreement on the reserve.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second point is transparency. We believe that the more detailed budgetary expenditure is, the simpler it will be for the competent budgetary authority to monitor its implementation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have therefore asked for the creation of new budgetary lines in areas of spending that are very sensitive for Parliament, such as agencies, rural development and other categories such as external action, with a view to, I repeat, a very clear commitment from Parliament and from the Committee on Budgetary Control, which was to contribute to maximum transparency, which is what public opinion demands of us.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has put forward an opinion, which was adopted unanimously – there were no votes against – in which, firstly, we celebrate the advances in appropriations aimed at improving competitiveness for economic growth and employment, and also, especially, those aimed at cohesion for growth and employment within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the matters that the Committee is responsible for, economic and monetary affairs, the field of enterprise, competition, taxation and customs union, the fight against tax fraud and general fraud in European statistics and, in particular, the chapter on statistics, we do of course welcome the budgetary advances, the budgetary approach, but of course we have also, found inadequacies.</p>
      <p sl="es">We would have liked more money, more money used for economic growth, in other words more money for the well-being of citizens, to provide clearer support for monetary union programmes, to provide clearer support for small and medium-sized enterprises as a source of job creation. Of course, we all need to be guided by the principles of austerity – this should come first and no one says so more than myself. However, this and the current shortcomings in our Union budgets are poles apart.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that the European Union should really have to make more incisive budgets in terms of stimulating economic growth that will create employment, and for this purpose allocating resources that belong to all the EU countries is absolutely necessary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission is now willing to spend 44.2%, corresponding to EUR 57 billion of the budget, on growth and employment. The increase in the corresponding budget headings by EUR 2.3 billion for 2008 effectively support the Lisbon Strategy. I should particularly like to highlight the three pilot projects in the social sector, even though the Committee on Budgets has not approved the funds for this in one instance and has substantially reduced them in a second instance.</p>
      <p sl="de">Even the project on the employment situation in health care, which has been reduced somewhat by the Committee on Budgets, is particularly close to my heart, because there have been considerable problems here since the EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007. The pilot project should therefore be carried out as we have devised it. This applies particularly in regard to possible regulations for social services. The same also applies to another project we have proposed, namely the social integration of migrants.</p>
      <p sl="de">Please therefore support the amendments we have re-inserted. I should also like to promote once again the family project to be carried out by the foundation in Dublin, which we would like to support to the tune of EUR 400 000, but which the Committee on Budgets has entirely rejected. Family-friendly jobs, the improvement in the housing situation for families and continuing family support are also prime objectives for us in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The treatment of these subjects should therefore be incorporated into the work schedule of the foundation in Dublin and the necessary funding made available, of course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has restored the budget figures reduced in its sector by the Council to the amounts stated in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. This means a 10.3% budget increase for the environmental sector compared with the 2007 budget year.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe this is also entirely appropriate for the most important instruments in the environmental sector. The EMEA, EEA, EFSA and ECDC – these are the abbreviations for our agencies, with whose work we are entirely satisfied – have also recovered their money. Life+ is agreed, work is beginning and the new health action plan is also replacing the old one from January 2008. So far, so good – all of it! We shall certainly be able to make an evaluation at the end of the year or in early 2009.</p>
      <p sl="de">The HELP programme is giving us cause for concern, however. We know how harmful tobacco consumption is. However, we also want the European public to hear and understand this message. 2008 is the last budget year in which we shall be receiving money for this anti-smoking campaign from the tobacco fund. We are asking the Commission to think very quickly about where the money for this campaign can come from in subsequent years.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, thank the rapporteur and our fellow Members on the Committee on Budgets for their continually constructive and effective cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two closely linked topics in particular are central for us in the Committee on Industry. On the one hand these concern – as has already been addressed today –Galileo and on the other hand, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology project. Both initiatives involve ground-breaking projects of vital importance in terms of policy on innovation and industry that deserve our full support.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Institute of Innovation and Technology will make an important contribution to the transfer of technology from science to industry and to enterprises. There is still a backlog of demand here in Europe. Funding, however, raises questions. The Committee on Industry has been arguing very clearly in favour of funding not being at the expense of other forward-looking programmes. We should not therefore be taking money from the Seventh Research Framework Programme, from a programme for life-long learning or from the Trans-European Networks programme to finance the European Institute of Innovation and Technology. No, we in the Committee on Industry are pleading for funds to be redeployed from the administrative budget for the benefit of the EIT. Thankfully the Committee on Budgets has also accordingly undertaken to do this. Furthermore, the Committee on Industry is pleading for clear funding even beyond its own budget line.</p>
      <p sl="de">Considerably more problematic is Galileo. Perhaps you would allow me simply to point out the following from the viewpoint of industrial policy: I believe there is agreement that we need Galileo and that it also has to be financed. The latest resolution on Galileo has resulted in Parliament arguing for Community funding, as has also been proposed by the Commission. Having said that, it is crucial, in my view, that the project ultimately continues. The project does not have to be relaunched but can be based on the considerable efforts of the industrial enterprises involved. This should also be taken into account during the upcoming negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Everything else regarding Galileo I am handing over to my colleague Mr Böge, who will also be responsible for continuing negotiations on the Committee on Budgets together with his colleagues here.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, firstly I would also like to start by thanking the members of the Committee on Budgets for the support that they have given to the amendments that were put forward by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, that were also adopted practically unanimously by the committee.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, with regard to budget Title 12, ‘Internal Market’, I would just like to say that what the committee aimed to do through our amendments was to recover the amounts in the PDB that had been envisaged by the Commission, which the Council document had subsequently reduced.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to mention or remind you of the importance that everything related to the internal market has in the European Union. I think that is obvious. It is one of the main bases for all the subsequent development that has been built around it.</p>
      <p sl="es">In some years, such as last year and next year, 2008, in which important legislation is to be adopted, for example the Services Directive, and also there are plans to continue moving towards legislation to perfect the internal market, we understand that it is necessary to recover the amounts envisaged in the PDB.</p>
      <p sl="es">The same argument could apply to Title 14, ‘Customs Union’, which also refers to perfecting the Union’s external borders, which, in turn, will enable us to ensure that our single market functions correctly.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, with regard to Title 17, relating to consumer protection, which concerns the committee for which I have been draftsman, I would like to say that, with the support of the Committee on Budgets, we have recovered the amounts in the PDB for the SOLVIT Programme. There are different levels of development of consumer policies and consumer protection policies in the various EU countries. On many occasions there are discrepancies that need to be resolved through non-legal, out-of-court instruments. SOLVIT has proved to be a good instrument for this.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, and I will conclude, Mr President, I would like to especially thank the Committee on Budgets for its support for a pilot project that has been allocated EUR 1 million, that will enable a study to be carried out in the next year monitoring and comparing the application of consumer policy measures in the various Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in its opinion the Committee on Regional Development gave particular attention to the budgetary lines relating to Chapter XIII, or the heading ‘Regional Policy’. We appealed to keep, or if necessary reinstate, all the budgetary lines from the preliminary draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Committee on Budgets met our demands, and even, in line 130616 relating to the European Regional Development Fund, asked for an increase in payments of EUR 900 million. The Committee on Budgets also shared our concern about the use of the unallocated part of the money in the cohesion area for additional funding of other projects, such as the European Institute of Technology, on the strength of a decision by the Council that would be at odds with the principle of cohesion and would also deplete the European Parliament’s prerogatives. To sum up, this is not our dream budget, it is not a budget that could delight us, but the Committee on Regional Development supports the draft budget proposed by the Committee on Budgets. Many thanks.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the following ritual is performed every year with regard to the agricultural budget: the Commission adopts the draft budget, then the Council makes cuts to many lines without much justification, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, backed by the Committee on Budgets, restores those lines, and then we start discussions on the basis of the Commission’s letter of amendment to adopt the precise budget for the following year.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why it is necessary for the Council to constantly make those cuts is a mystery to me, as we have been holding discussions based on that Commission letter of amendment since as far back as the Treaty of Amsterdam, as it provides us with the most recent figures available. I think that we had better continue that way.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Committee on Agriculture has increased a number of lines: those for school fruit, school milk, and so on, as we all want awareness of good nutrition to start at an early age.

      <p sl="pt">The reports by Mr Virrankoski and myself are a clear signal for strengthening the fisheries policy, even with all the constraints linked to the Financial Perspective; I therefore urge my fellow Members to give them firm support and the Council to take account of the proposals we have submitted as well as Parliament’s proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am speaking here for the Committee on Culture, which is responsible not only for culture, but also for education, youth, media and sport. Our budget is very limited when compared to what it ought to be.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that when we take a good look at how successful the ERASMUS programme has been, whereby university students in Europe can study in different countries, make friends in other parts of Europe, and discuss it afterwards among their friends and contacts, it is clear that it makes an essential contribution to mutual understanding in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that we should do more for communication, especially now that the Heads of State or Government have agreed on the Reform Treaty. The idea of ‘going local’, working with people in their own environment to gain their support for a European future, is crucial. I am delighted that two pilot projects, at least, were possible: EuroGlobe, a mobile theatre like those from Shakespeare’s era, set up to tour European capital cities so as to really involve citizens, and a culture project on the theme of artist mobility, to enable Europe’s young artists to come together, work together and shape Europe’s future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am standing in for Mrs Dührkop who cannot be here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs had defined three main priorities for the 2008 budget. The first of these priorities concerned the strengthening of the operational resources available to the Frontex agency, which, as you know, is charged with coordinating cooperation on the EU’s external borders. This objective has been met: if Parliament takes our lead, Frontex will receive 30 million in additional operating appropriations, that is, more than double the 2007 allocation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second priority concerned the need for transparency in the management of the computerised systems for controlling entry to European territory. Appropriations were therefore put in reserve for the Schengen SIS I and SIS II systems and for the visa information system, known as the VIS for short. These appropriations will not be released until we have adequate legal bases where necessary, and whatever the case, information about the invitations to tender and contracts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, our Committee’s third priority concerns the European Return Fund. All the appropriations for this were placed in reserve and will only be released once the Council and Parliament have adopted the Directive on common standards and procedures for returning illegally staying third-country nationals. The Council should know this: no Directive, no dough. It is as simple as that.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that finally, following the Lisbon Summit, we can move on to the signing of the Reform Treaty and its ratification and implementation. We all understand that this new Treaty is necessary for Europe’s development and consolidation. For this reason, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I was surprised that budget heading 3b, which relates to European citizenship, was the only one where significantly reduced expenditure had been planned compared with the 2007 budget. At a time when the European Union’s institutional structure is changing, resources are needed for communication with EU residents. EU citizens must be informed about changes to be made, and their cooperation and support must be secured. I am therefore grateful to the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs from my political group, and especially the rapporteurs and the members of the Committee on Budgets, for their support for my proposals on various budget headings to increase expenditure on this programme. I hope that Parliament will also support the budget amendments and that these resources will be used appropriately to strengthen the European Union. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is important to treat the budget in a gender-neutral manner, as we should and must do, from the women’s policy point of view. The aspect of gender is of great importance here and ‘gender budgeting’ must not be merely empty words, but must be seen to be put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is very important that we top up the DAPHNE programme. Unfortunately, our amendment did not get through and we will now raise it in the Plenary once again. We Social Democrats support the amendment and the increase of funds for DAPHNE, because it is a relatively small, but very important programme to combat domestic violence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then it is also important to provide appropriate financing for the European Institute for Gender Equality, to ensure that it is launched successfully. It is also important that expenditure for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue is distributed equally between the sexes. There are a great many women, especially migrants, who should be given a vital role in this intercultural dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="it">I believe that the budget should be the fundamental political act of each public institution, but also of each private entity, because it illustrates the policy decisions on which public money will be spent. There are three fundamental elements: first, rigour; second, the courage to make effective and efficient policy choices; third, control of expenditure. Evidently, as Mr Virrankoski said, this all requires a firm and resolute policy which also embraces the revision of procedures, which I fully support.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now, as to the question of the Committee on Petitions, we felt we should suggest to the Committee on Budgets that the proposed increase of 4.69% in the Ombudsman’s budget was fair and appropriate, partly because the Ombudsman is now a key political figure in the democracy and transparency of the European Union and in sound administration, which he must guard vigilantly.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, the most important item in the budget for 2008 is cohesion policy. In practice there are underdeveloped regions in every Member State, and so we all have an interest in this issue. Moreover, cohesion is also in the interests of those who are involved in financing this process, and not just in the interests of the beneficiaries. This is why we cannot accept any suggestion of making significant cuts, equivalent to around half a billion euros, to payments relating to cohesion policy. In my view, Parliament is convinced that the new Member States will be capable of adjusting and spending all the funds available to them. We all need to push for this in our own countries as well.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is not the only item about which we are, and will continue to be, in disagreement with the Council. We can also state with certainty that we have managed European citizens’ money well, in other words responsibly, for the 2008 budget is much lower than the ceilings set out in the financial framework. That is why it is disappointing that daggers are still drawn in the debate on the Galileo Programme budget or on the European Institute of Technology. Both of these would be advantageous for the European Union’s development, so why do we have to put obstacles in the way of making them a reality?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has done this year what it always does: it has allowed its civil servants in the Ministries of Finance to put together a budget that takes into account the Council’s main aim which is ‘keep the figures down’ and, most importantly, ‘keep payments down’.</p>
      <p sl="de">It bears no relation to the political plans that we in the European Union want to implement – no relation at all! The Council in its many formations is still in the habit of preaching on Sundays and being content to let others, that is, Parliament, do the real work for the rest of the week. It does not matter whether the issue is external policy matters, or aid for Kosovo or Palestine or about implementing policies on competitiveness for growth and employment that are extremely important for Europe, vital to its survival, in fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">Parliament looked ahead and pointed out, even during negotiations on the financial perspective 18 months ago, that there would be problems with financing exactly these policies within the foreseeable future. However, our message fell on deaf ears and now the Council has to make it up as it goes along. Sooner than we expected, we are facing a situation where we are having to provide public funds to rescue the Galileo project because the dream of entrepreneurial initiative has collapsed. The European Parliament was able to agree fairly quickly that it would finance the beginning of the Galileo project with European money, by using the ‘Community method’. We see anything else as quackery, and want no part of it.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are prepared to provide Galileo with EUR 2.4 billion from 2008 to 2013, in addition to the EUR 1 billion that were already planned. However, since the required funds are not available in Heading 1a, and are not going to fall from the sky, we are prepared to take it from other budget categories, from Heading 2 2007 and 2008, making EUR 2.2 billion, and EUR 220 million from Heading 5. Certainly that is a lot of money from Heading 2, but it is possible without farmers being deprived of funds. Prices for agricultural products are high on the world market, so our subsidies can be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">The transaction for which we created the basis in the Budget Committee in the first reading, is called a ‘minor revision’. Pah! The Council avoids even the most minor of revisions like the plague but that is the Council’s problem. Anyway, we are prepared to create the preconditions for Galileo, a flagship of European technological innovation.</p>
      <p sl="de">That fact that, as part of this minor revision, we are prepared to make funds available for the European Institute of Technology is, for us, worth only passing mention, due to the size, well, actually the smallness, of the amount initially required: EUR 2.9 million from 2008 to 2013. We expect the Council to get moving and to come to Parliament and move in our direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, allow me one further remark. We really expected the Finance Minister or at least a State Secretary from the Portuguese Council Presidency to attend this debate at the first reading, so that we could welcome his presence. Nothing against you, Mr Mourato, but even the Portuguese Vice-President of our own Parliament is no substitute in this instance.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Europe needs Galileo. We want funding for Galileo to be Community funding and we want the appropriations to be guaranteed without having a negative impact on other priorities.</p>

I believe that the regional and local media can have a much greater impact than certain centralised, more bureaucratic initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, I have taken the floor in the debate on the budget for 2008 in order to raise the following issues.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, although at nearly EUR 129 billion, the expenditure in this budget is the highest in the history of the Union, the ratio of this expenditure to the gross national income of the 27 Member States is the lowest ever, and, following adjustments by the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, is barely 0.99% of the gross national income in commitment appropriations, which I would like to emphasise.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, within the Financial Perspective period 2007-2013, the commitment appropriations ceiling for 2008 is set at 1.08% of the Member States’ gross national income, so we are looking here at a significant discrepancy between what we wanted to fund just two years ago and what the European Union wants to fund now. You cannot have more Europe for a lot less money. This view has been repeated over and over again in this House and we need to be reminded of it again today.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, we must support the decisions of the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets that significantly increase the funding for the Galileo Programme, the European Institute of Technology and certain external activities of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Fourthly, we must press for the European Commission to accept the programmes put forward by Member States for regional development and the development of rural areas as quickly as possible. More than EUR 20 billion will be allocated to the new Member States specifically in 2008. It would therefore be a good thing if these funds could be utilised as effectively as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, fifthly, it is worth noting the instigation of the fund for adaptation to globalisation, which will enable companies experiencing the negative consequences of this process to take advantage of transitional support and to safeguard EU jobs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am going to focus my comments on the report by our colleague, Mr Itälä, who has done a good job. We know it is always very difficult to decide the budget for our institution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have only one real regret: there is something very special about the 2008 budget. It is the last budget in which we could collect a lot of money together for investment, particularly in Parliament’s property policy. We have 32 places of work, if you count all our offices in different capitals. Apart from Brussels and Strasbourg, we own only six of the places in which we work in the various countries. We know there is an acquisition policy, which the Court of Auditors is regularly asking us to pursue but we cannot implement it because Mr Itälä – and I understand his concern about sending out a signal by saying we are not spending all the money because we want to remain below the 20% ceiling – is preventing Parliament from injecting money into it and putting together a property portfolio. However, it was 2008 or never, because in 2009 we will be paying for the Member’s Statute, as you know, and we will no longer be able to do it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Apart from that climb-down, I have to acknowledge that Mr Itälä has done a very good job, and in particular it is one of the greenest budgets I have seen as it contains many provisions, particularly provisions to reduce carbon emissions, offset our carbon impact, a desire to have a fleet of vehicles that includes hybrid cars, the desire to cut the number of meetings by holding videoconferences, and even by reducing the amount of travel by officials, who do not necessarily follow us to the places where they are needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To sum up, therefore, we should have had more money for investment and actions in 2008, the pre-election year, but generally speaking it is still a very good report because of the impact on policies I hold dear. That is why we will vote for this report, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the two minutes I have to speak I would like once again to point out that budgetary history is repeating itself. The European Commission presents the proposed Community budget, this time for 2008, the Council proposes significant cuts to the Commission proposal, and Parliament comes forward with a proposal for reducing the cuts in the Commission’s and Council’s drafts. Everything seems normal, were it not that all these proposals are below the 2008 budget in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As happened in the previous financial framework for 2000-2006, the budget ceiling provided for in the current Financial Perspective is not being adhered to, since the Community budget in 2007 was EUR 1.6 billion less in commitment appropriations and more than EUR 8 billion less in payment appropriations, without taking account of actual implementation. It is clear that the amounts entered in the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 are already insufficient in themselves, in our opinion, to promote real economic and social cohesion in an enlarged European Union of 27 countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Basically, all these proposals for the 2008 Community budget run counter to the requirements of the rich countries which impose a ceiling on the budget of about 1% of Community GNI, thereby reducing its share of this budget and minimising its redistributive role. Parliament’s proposal covers aspects that improve the draft presented by the Council, such as increasing the appropriations for the cohesion policy, as we also proposed, though we should stress that its effective implementation is to a large extent undermined later to meet the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy’s neoliberal agenda, which we firmly reject.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, even Parliament’s proposal represents a cut of more than EUR 5 billion in payment appropriations, in relation to what was agreed for 2008 in the multiannual financial framework. Since this is a phase of the negotiation process, we hope that, in contrast to what has happened in the past, Parliament will at least seek to ensure that the minimum amounts laid down in the Financial Perspective for 2008 are adhered to as closely as possible.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for budget debates, there is a well-known law we call the law of the three ‘Ls’, because budget debates involve reeling off Litanies, like in a religious Liturgy, which ends up causing economic Lethargy. We are finding this with the 2008 budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">The litanies first. Mr Virrankoski reels off these litanies like Mr Elles did in 2006, and like our fellow Member Mr Garriga Polledo did in 2005. First of all, the litany of cutting off appropriations: in the draft budget, the Council of Ministers cuts off the appropriations in the preliminary draft budget. Mr Mulder has explained to us that this is quite normal for agriculture, for example. The European Parliament, however, is proposing to restore the appropriations. The litany is also one of a budget consistently below the ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. The multiannual financial framework is already very short of the necessary appropriations and the budget even more so. It is a cascade of Malthusianism. It is also a litany of political priorities: year after year, fighting poverty, education, training, agricultural multifunctionality and the seventh framework programme on research are mentioned, and that is where the liturgy comes in.</p>
      <p sl="en">The liturgy is primarily in the budgetary nomenclature and the ideology supporting that nomenclature. The nomenclature is the presentation of the budget by activity, the preparation of the budget by activity. In practice, the expenditure is chopped up into titles, into political fields, which correspond to the directorates-general. The budget is like a huge salami, a type of grocer’s shop inventory, the problem being, as the rapporteur has seen, that dividing the budget up by activity creates confusion with the multiannual financial framework, which is split into broader categories. One has five categories: competitiveness, preservation of natural resources, freedom, the EU as a global partner, administration, and the other has about thirty political activities, and the correspondence between these categories is difficult to establish.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this is done in the name of a budgetary ideology, the ideology of performance, competitiveness, effectiveness, efficiency and results, and this creates a jumble of nebulous tools, results indicators, performance indicators, activities sheets. This budgetary technology is presented as new, as being in the vanguard of budgetary intelligence, but it is actually something quite old, dating back to 1947. It was the American Hoover Committee that first talked about the concepts of performance, cost/benefit, efficiency, targets and results. It was this that gave the US the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System in the 1960s under the Johnson Presidency, and that under President Carter gave the BBZ, or budget base zero – the budgetary performance ideology that subsequently spread to New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France in 2001 with its organic law on finance laws, and even Mexico in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">One might understand from this why the European budget is lacking in transparency and really in efficiency too. The European Parliament does not contain 100 people capable of understanding the European budget by activity, with the consequence that this entails: the economic lethargy of the European Union. Because if there is no Galileo, if there is no Lyon-Turin link, if there is no Genoa-Barcelona link, if the capital cities are not connected by high-speed trains, if the research budget is not what it should be, if the budget for a Europe of 27 Member States is the same as the Spanish budget, if the European budget is one twentieth of the budget of the United States, it is precisely because of this Malthusian ideology. Perhaps it is time we realised that alongside the ordinary budget, we need an extraordinary budget to make loans financed by a major European loan, which would permit investment.</p>

      <p sl="sk">If we were to rate the confidence in centrally financed activities of the EU according to budgetary expenditure expressed as a share of EU GNI, the trajectory of the confidence curve would resemble that of a falling leaf. This is truly alarming. Payment appropriations as a share of EU GNI have fallen regularly for several years to around 1%. In the 2008 draft budget they dropped to 0.95%. Similar trends can be seen not only with regard to the volume of budget resources but also payment appropriations in relation to the payments ceiling of the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In particular the proposed EUR 10 billion in unallocated payment appropriations appears to be a substantial deviation from the aims of the long-term financial framework. I, too, am astonished that the Council is proposing over EUR 1 billion of cuts to payments for the programmes aimed at improving European competitiveness and cohesion. I therefore share the view that the payment appropriations are insufficient in the light of the policy challenges faced by the EU. That is why I will support the proposal to increase payments appropriations to 0.99%.of EU GNI.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I would like to address two important reserves in the Commission Budget: one for buildings policy and one for staff. Regarding the latter, it can be said that the screening report has shown us that the Commission employs almost 11 000 staff in administrative support and coordination – administering the administration. If you add the translators and housekeepers to that, it then becomes the area with the greatest growth in staff numbers, because that adds a further 5 700 people. Given that we mention ‘better regulation’ from time to time, we must immediately start requiring ‘better organisation’. To do that, we need more information, and that is what the reserve is for.</p>
      <p sl="de">Part of the job that Parliament gave the Commission to do was benchmarking, comparing staff positions with those in international organisations. The Commission is not allowing us to see this comparison, stating that it has agreed to keep the identities of those organisations anonymous. That is a bit rich! We can only make progress here if Parliament receives the information it has asked for – proper information, not fragments. The screening gives us a one-off, first-time look at the staff structure of the Commission, for which we are grateful, but there are no conclusions, and the Commission has not produced an action plan. I must ask firmly that this action plan be presented.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nor are there any conclusions about buildings policy in Brussels. The communication from the Commission in July on building needs does not take into account the results of the staff screening, although the same Commissioner is responsible for both. You are not that Commissioner, which is disappointing and cannot continue. The amounts placed in reserve by Parliament compel the Commission to link these two documents. The Commission must finally get to work on this matter and do its job properly because, in my view, the results of the staff screening that we have been given so far cannot be presented to our voters.</p>

      <p sl="sk">To begin with I would like to thank both rapporteurs. My thanks to Mr Itälä for over eight months of cooperation on the issue of the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008. Over the last four years the institutions’ budget has increased by almost 18%, chiefly as a result of enlargement. In the future this budget will not grow at such a rate. If we want to make the institutions more efficient, we need to improve the cooperation between them. I am glad that the fears of risks associated with such cooperation have not come true.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the one hand, we have been trying to ensure that all the tasks that the citizens expect the institutions to fulfil will be fulfilled. On the other hand, we have been trying to ensure effective use of the funds. When allocating the European Parliament’s budget, the most important thing for us is to concentrate, both now and in the future, on our main role and priority: improving the legislative process. Issues that are not related to this have to be reduced in the budget to an absolute minimum. We are well on the way to achieving that.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, back in March we said that you need to have better information on all the resources and materials at your disposal, so that you can work in a responsible and efficient manner. We are therefore calling for the creation of a knowledge management system that will enable the Members to work in an effective manner, using all documents.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ladies and gentlemen, you want to prove to the voters that you manage their funds responsibly. However, sometimes we do not have documents available in even the most common languages. There are extraordinary committee meetings for which new resources are needed. We need to improve flexibility in this area. Spending on buildings accounts for a large portion of the institutions’ budget: we should therefore keep a close eye on this in the future. In the past, there were instances where European institutions bought or leased property for prices above the market value. In the future we want closer attention to be paid to all aspects of purchasing, leasing and renovation. Our aim is to lower costs and ensure flexibility. We want to avoid cartels and monopolies.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Our next priority is to provide better information to the citizens of the European Union. We have thus decided to strengthen this area by helping regional and local media. Ladies and gentlemen, we want to continue to make the institutions operate more efficiently. The reports we receive about their activities must be more informative. These reports should clearly indicate whether or not the targets have been reached. I welcome the method used by the institutions to prepare the budget with the help of inflation coefficients as well as on the basis of what is really needed. In conclusion, I want to thank the rapporteur because we have managed, by way of a number of difficult debates, to reach a good compromise that will lead to better use of European taxpayers’ money.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one and a half minutes to say what you think of the 2008 draft budget is a formidable task, but I would first like to take the time to thank our rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, with whom we have had to navigate our way with great difficulty through the decisions that the Committee on Budgets is proposing today. Of course, the2007-2013 multiannual financial framework squeezes us into an austerity that unfortunately does not allow us to pursue, either as steadily or above all as quickly, the objectives we have set ourselves for Europe, the policies of which are, to my mind, the only way of saving the regions of Europe because they can give our fellow citizens the comfortable lifestyles they aspire to in a global environment that has metamorphosed and is constantly shifting and evolving. I therefore invite Parliament to support our committee’s initiatives, especially with the prospect of a mid-term renegotiation of the multiannual framework and the definition of a new mechanism for own resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of this budget, because I only have a little time I would just like to mention one point. As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds in the Committee on Budgets, I have decided to ask the members of the European Commission what the reasons were for putting 30% of the administrative costs of these funds in reserve. The study we presented recently with Mr Virrankoski on the implementation of the Structural Funds highlights the considerable time it has taken the Commission to approve the national frameworks and operational programmes, so there are now record outstanding commitments of three years; by taking this firm stance on the reserve, we wanted to raise the alarm. The regional policies, like the support for research and innovation, are policies of prime importance for the future of our economy, and therefore for jobs and the quality of life of Europeans. We want to do things quickly, but we want to do things well, which explains the high level of appropriations we are asking the Council to support.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, there is one aspect of the budget that should be mentioned, and that is the money to be set aside for the common agricultural policy. The CAP, as it is called, has undergone numerous reforms in the last 15 years: the Mac Sharry reforms, Agenda 2000, and the decoupling of payments from production.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I should like to clarify one point: the governments of the Member States might not agree to any changes to the payments to be made under the CAP to farmers in Europe as a whole between 2007 and 2013. Indeed, in my country, Ireland, firm financial arrangements have been laid down for farmers under the agricultural policy to be pursued between 2007 and 2013. We know that agricultural policy is to be the subject of a health check, but not a general review. And the check will not cover the financial arrangements which EU leaders have made for farmers in Ireland and Europe up to 2013. I hope that this will be understood and that nothing will be left out; and that there will be no attempts at distortion, for it is vital for farmers throughout Europe that everything should be in order.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, our group is naturally voting in favour of the amendment proposal to allocate even more money to Palestine. However, we must highlight the fact that both the Council and the Commission should ensure that we do not end up in a situation in which we are throwing money into a bottomless pit. This is the case with much of the aid that is currently being given and contradicts the EU’s principles for aid, where the beneficiary must be made able to develop a sustainable economy. However, this is impossible because Israel is stifling Palestinian society and its economy, and not just in Gaza. The delegation from the Committee on Development witnessed this when it visited the West Bank and Gaza in September. EU money flows endlessly without Israel being held accountable at all.</p>
      <p sl="da">We have been given an account of a dialogue from Washington, in which one of the White House’s Middle East consultants was asked about the EU’s role. He responded: ‘EU? We give orders, Europe pays!’ This is true, too! We keep on paying out, and Israel is simply being allowed to destroy everything that we have built up. The Commission and the Council must now make demands on Israel. The blockade of Gaza must be stopped in order to allow goods and people to move in and out. Gaza is now effectively one large open-air prison. The barriers on the West Bank must also be removed. It is not only our delegation that is saying this; the message from the World Bank and from our own ECHO was equally clear. If there is no hope of improvement or any light at the end of the tunnel, we are abusing EU citizens’ tax payments, and this must stop immediately!</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the EU’s budget is the main way to achieve political priorities. Its budgetary policy seems to have three aims: business competitiveness, anti-terrorism and intervention in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">Expenditure is used to achieve these three aims, but the interests and concerns of the masses are entirely different. They relate to their future places of work, income, pensions, and state school and university education.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us ask ourselves about the political priorities set by the budget: do they really improve the lives of citizens? Is the EU as a global player meeting its commitments fairly? How does the allocation of some EUR 741 million to promote freedom, security and justice improve the lives of European citizens?</p>
      <p sl="el">The Commission’s recent consultation paper on the reform of the budget says that today and especially in the future the budget ought to intensifying competition for raw materials and markets, shifting the balance of economic power and liberalising huge new markets which create new opportunities for Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, this is exactly what is leading the people of Europe astray. For a start, instead of the budgets of Member States being aimed at social justice, they are aggravating the struggle to control the markets regardless of the means. Secondly, this stirs up public opinion in third countries against Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are still at the beginning of the new financial perspective, so we are being cautious in programming expenditure for 2008. At the same, this is the fourth annual budget of this parliamentary term, and we have therefore accumulated sufficient experience of the budgetary procedure and the specific rules of the game between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. That is most probably why a record number of amendments were smoothly voted through in the Committee on Budgets under the efficient leadership of Mr Böge in a spirit of consensus, which will certainly facilitate block voting on Thursday and will certainly equip us with greater negotiating strength in shaping the draft budget for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The priorities for 2008 have been named again and again, and the funding of the Galileo Programme has again and again been specified as a problem. I am therefore pleased to make the point that for the first time the Baltic Sea region has been given consideration in this budget, not by way of a declaration, but in a financial, i.e. a real sense. Perhaps this is because both the Commissioner, the two rapporteurs and the Chair of the Committee on Budgets are inhabitants of that region. It is good that the European Union is taking on global commitments, but the larger the European Union becomes, the more its responsibility increases for our own continent, including the Baltic Sea region, i.e. the internal sea of the European Union as it is now, and everyone knows what a poor state it is in. In view of this, it is good that we have found, in the form of pilot projects and preparatory actions, a financial instrument to increase funding for regional development, safety of navigation, simplification of border-crossing procedures, and above all, protection of the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hope that these priorities will stand up for themselves in the stern mirror of the European Commission, along with the whole of our budget strategy.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, I will start by saying that I agree with what Mr Itälä has said on the issue of budgetary procedure and that no one is prepared to be a ‘rubber stamp’. I therefore suggest that we discuss this subject as quickly as possible in order to address the difficulties and the differences that appear to exist in an effective manner. On a different level, we welcome the EUR 30 million increase in Frontex’s budget. Realistically we expect an improvement in the Agency’s structure, better coordination and more determined operations. Parliament gave a clear and concrete signal that it is now up to Frontex and the Member States to eliminate the inefficiency, the unkept promises and the delay we have suffered over the past year. Another point that I would like to address relates to reports and studies produced within or commissioned by the various institutions, including the Commission. There is a need for a common database of reports and studies in order to avoid duplication of work, reduce waste and at the same time make information more accessible. In addition, there should be an annual report that lists these studies and reports, who won the contract, how much they cost and, if possible, what use was made of them. We should also examine the impact and added value of the reports produced by the Economic and Social Council and the Committee of the Regions, particularly in the light of reports that are too technical or reports that have already been produced by the Commission or by Parliament. On the subject of the purchase of premises, I would like to remind you that in 2006 it was agreed that we would once again reexamine the policy regarding the purchase and leasing of buildings used by the institutions, including the information offices. I am under the impression that over the years, the institutions, for various reasons, have bought and leased buildings at a price that appears higher than the market price. Without questioning the merits of the policy on the purchase of buildings, it still makes sense to examine, in an institutional manner, how we can improve the conditions under which we purchase and lease premises and to bring offices closer to the market prices and thus avoid the situation of cartels or monopolies. Lastly, I would like to congratulate the Finnish double act on their useful work and the manner in which negotiations were conducted.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, who has done an excellent job. However, I would like to make the point that if the European Union wants to be a global player, then it is ridiculous that it wants to spend less money on foreign policy than on administrative expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Secondly, it is also unacceptable that expenditure under the enlargement heading, considered a priority, should also be lower in nominal terms relative to 2007, and, thirdly, it is unacceptable that expenditure on external affairs should increase to a lesser extent – by about 1.5% – than general expenditure, which is set to increase by 2%. This means that the European Union has not ensured that there will be sufficient resources available to carry out the tasks it has set out; nor has it ensured that there will be sufficient funds to implement foreign policy priorities. Adequate funds have not been allocated for the mission to Kosovo, nor for providing assistance to the Palestinian people; I fear the budget will have to be amended again several times next year because no provision has been made for this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The imbalance between the eastern and southern components of the European neighbourhood policy has been a recurrent problem for many years. The countries to the south have received three times as much money in per capita terms as those to the east, and this is unacceptable. Lastly, I think it is important to resolve the issue of cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council regarding the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) heading. As yet there has been no ex ante agreement or policy dialogue, and until this happens, I agree with placing EUR 40 million in reserve for the CFSP. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is time we paid closer attention to the Baltic. Since the 2004 round of enlargement it has been an internal sea of the EU, but at the same time it is one of the world’s sickest and most polluted seas, something that shames the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fi">One of these pilot projects has to do with reducing the amount of hazardous waste that ends up in the Baltic Sea and correcting the oxygen deficit in the deep basins of the sea. The other is connected with cutting the sulphur dioxide emissions from shipping though emissions trading. If this experiment gives good results, sulphur dioxide emissions trading may become a viable way to cut sulphur dioxide emissions in all sea areas of the EU, which would clean up the air we all breathe in the future all over Europe.

However, in my remarks, instead of the three ‘L’s used by Mr Martinez, which if I remember correctly were ‘litany’, ‘liturgy’ and ‘lethargy’, I would rather use three ‘I’s, which are ‘implementation’, ‘initiation’ and ‘imagination’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Virrankoski, for including a couple of paragraphs about the monitoring of the budget. It is extremely important that we think about the question of value for money. Even if that particular term is not included in the resolution, it is, no doubt, in the hearts of everybody that we need to be able to justify, with our specialised committees, the monies we are actually spending, not just in the current period, but also in the fact of having the national management declarations, which it seems many Member States are still reluctant to put together.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to thank both the rapporteurs and the Commissioner, in this regard, for having, in my own budget for the year 2007, implemented those pilot projects and preparatory projects which were included. There are quite a few of them, and it is nice to have a certain continuity as we go through into 2008, particularly picking up on the pilot information networks, but also on the projects with the EU, China and India.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to my last point, which is the question of imagination. Einstein said that imagination is more important than knowledge. We have seen in this debate that many colleagues – Mr Mantovani, Ms Guy-Quint and others – and myself always deplore the fact that we have too little money in category four, the external actions. We know perfectly well there is too little, so I would put in a particular plea at this stage, as we look towards the budget review, that maybe we should actually use a little imagination to see how the European Union will be called upon in the future to meet the global challenges of the future and to play its part in global assistance and the functioning of the global economy, and then make sure we have the means to be able to implement what we wish to take on as our policies.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, with a budget that represents 0.99% of the Union’s GDP we cannot have a solid political position.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to category 1a, competitiveness for growth and employment, it should be pointed out that this is the first time that the figures on these policies represent the majority of the preliminary draft budget. However, the Council’s figures cut down these categories relating to the Lisbon Strategy, which should be at the core of the Union’s policies.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to mention the financing of Galileo and the European Institute of Technology, which are priority projects for our competitiveness and credibility. The financial perspective 2007-2013 are insufficient to finance projects of such strategic importance.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another point relates to the Frontex Agency, which plays an essential role, both from a humanitarian point of view and from a political point of view. The European Council in June reiterated the need to strengthen Frontex in order to improve the Union’s capacity to manage its external borders.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is also one of the priorities that have been expressed on several occasions by Parliament. Proof of this is the proposed increase of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations for the Agency’s operational costs, which is an increase of 127% on the preliminary draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="es">The allocation to category 4 is clearly insufficient for achieving our objectives and fulfilling our promises as a global player and, in particular, as has already been said here, in the operations in Kosovo and Palestine.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to say that the confirmation of the Union’s participation in EXPO Zaragoza 2008 – Water and Sustainable Development – is the right decision and is a good opportunity to bring European policies closer to the citizens of Europe, which we need to do.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Kyösti Virrankoski for his excellent preparation of the budget. He has listened to the different parties concerned, and has also taken the proposals of the Committee on Regional Development into proper consideration. The rapporteur Mr Itälä has also done a very good job.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important that the appropriations for regional development remain at an adequate level. At the same time, we have to ensure that regional policy practices and administration are simplified and clarified both in the Union and in the Member States, so that all the appropriations set aside for regional development can be spent more effectively and wisely in the Member States to reduce regional differences and to implement the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The bureaucracy that is the bugbear of the Union also disrupts the implementation of regional policy. The first year of the new programming period is almost over, and most of the programmes are still unapproved. This is a serious problem, as the rapporteur said. Because the Commission and the Member States have been dawdling, projects have been slow to begin and the first year of the programming period will be a problematic gap year. The Commission should approve the rest of the programmes without delay, so that the appropriations reserved in the budget can be spent effectively and fruitfully, and so that the new programmes can get under way properly.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, too, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä. With this budget, Parliament will double the Frontex Agency’s budget to almost EUR 70 million. This is a measure that speaks for itself, because the priority that Parliament is giving to Frontex is now clear to all. The increase of EUR 30 million has been allocated to Frontex’s operational budget in order to increase its missions in those areas that are worst hit by the influx of migrants. At the same time, Mr President, we have put 30% of Frontex’s administrative budget in reserve because we want the Agency to be more effective in its work. There are three conditions for removing this reserve: firstly, we want the Director of Frontex to establish regular contact with us to strengthen Parliament’s scrutiny of the Agency. Secondly, we want detailed information on Frontex’s work programme for the coming year, and because Commissioner Frattini, Vice-President of the European Commission, himself announced that from next year Frontex’s mission in the Mediterranean would become permanent, we now expect the Agency to be allocated far more than the EUR 10 million that it originally projected up to now for missions on the maritime borders. Thirdly, we want an updated and realistic list of the resources, ships, aeroplanes, helicopters that the Member States are prepared to put at the disposal of Frontex missions. We do not want ficticious lists, like we had this year, where the Member States supposedly agreed to provide Frontex with about 21 aeroplanes, 27 helicopters and 117 boats but in practice, when the missions came to be carried out, the Member States unashamedly ignored their own promises. Therefore, we expect Frontex to work to a proper schedule that can be relied upon before we remove the reserve. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, many are now wondering why Parliament is seeking a revision of the long-term budget. Are we really not able to cope with new needs such as Galileo, the European Institute of Technology, the EIT, the EU’s work in Kosovo and Palestine, and at the same time make budget cuts? The problem is that budget ceilings apply to the whole budget, but of course they also apply to each individual budget category. In order to avoid, for example, Galileo entailing cuts to other research programmes, we are requesting what we call minor revision. But note that this is within the framework of the overall ceilings. We would prefer to cut surpluses in the agriculture budget, that is what is important. As regards Palestine and the costs of the EU’s work in Kosovo we want to use the ‘flexibility instrument’. Otherwise we have to take money from Africa or Latin America, and that would be unreasonable.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The EU’s rigid budget model needs to be changed. But I want to be clear, I do not want to step outside the overall framework, only to achieve greater flexibility within the framework in order to manage new needs. How otherwise will we in future, for example, address what is needed in climate and energy policy? In addition to this, I want to mention just two things. First, the debate on the Treaty shows the importance of increased resources and a long-term perspective in the EU efforts in respect of communication, dialogue and democratic development. I then tried to make some adjustments to the allocation of quotas in this area by the Committee on Budgets. I hope that we are now all agreed on more aggressive investment. Secondly, I want to mention the pilot project that I myself have initiated. It relates to support for the reconstruction of cultural and religious institutions and monuments in conflict-affected areas. The proposal concerns, first of all, the Balkans, but in the long term it should also be possible to use the experience gained from that in other areas where destroyed museums, and razed churches and mosques, can constitute a cause of conflict which the EU can help to remove. Such areas could be, for example, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq, and perhaps even Tibet. In this area I appeal for the Members’ understanding and support. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä. I know both men and I also know that they are in favour of openness and transparency and are keen to structure the European Union’s economy on a sustainable basis, as is only appropriate. It is good to keep a tight rein on expenditure and acknowledge the demands of common sense. I would like briefly to focus attention on a few issues, the first of which is research and innovation. Although I know that this is largely in the hands of the Member States, all the same, the European Union needs to remember its own commitments, the Lisbon Strategy, for example, and it has to keep to them, so that we can channel budget money into research and innovation, creating new added value for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am delighted with this emphasis on the Baltic Sea. I believe it has largely emerged on account of the rapporteurs. It is good to realise what a state the Baltic is in and these two pilot projects are a good start. It is true that we need considerably more input, but this is a good place to begin.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Thirdly, when drafting the budget it is important to remember the principles of sustainable development and the Union’s values. This must be the way to act, for example, when we send money to third countries, and we are involved in various projects such as the Palestinian Autonomous Area. We need to ensure that resources are used properly and that they do not result in work which runs counter to democracy, human rights and freedom of speech, that is, the Union’s values. The way in which money is spent and the Union’s values must always go hand in hand.</p>

      <p sl="ro">At the beginning of this year, we planned to negotiate together with the Council a pragmatic and efficient budget of results, which would achieve the policies now necessary in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">By our amendments in the Committee on Budgets, we have made severe cut-backs in the programmes consuming the tax payers’ money without any real value added. The cut-backs in agriculture, amounting to 553,000,000 euros, namely 77% of all the cut-backs operated, reveal another clear agenda of the Council to gradually eliminate this policy that the entire structure of the new Member States’ economy depends on. I am glad that, in the Committee on Budgets, we have managed to reestablish the level of the funds designated to agriculture. I also hope that the operational programmes and the rural development programme will be approved as soon as possible by the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Besides these aspects, I would like to speak about the importance of the budget for the European Union’s youth policy. The budget we have proposed operates a 9% increase in finances for lifelong learning programmes, reaching a total amount of 900,000,000 euros. These programmes have contributed to advancing the European idea more than anything else. 90% of young people identify the European Union with the possibility to travel, to study and to work anywhere in Europe. For these young people, we have to do more. One of the problems they deal with is the small number of European scholarships, especially as regards the Erasmus programme. In the current budget, we have increased payments by 100,000,000 euros due to the European Union’s enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria. Nevertheless, we have to make sure that a bigger share of this money reaches every student. Erasmus should not be an additional income for young students but, on the contrary, the main support for those with low financial possibilities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last, but not least, I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments undertaken in the trialogue of July, namely to ensure an adequate number of jobs for the new Member States. At present, very few Romanians or Bulgarians work in management positions and, on the contrary, many of them work under temporary contracts. The additional funds we have provided to the European Union’s Selection Office should be spent efficiently for the employment of permanent personnel for the new Member States as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="bg">It is a challenge for a representative of Bulgaria, one of the newest EU Member States, to take part in the adoption of the 2008 budget as a full member. This has become possible thanks to the enlargement policy pursued by the European Union and supported also through its budgetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I support the report and congratulate the rapporteurs and coordinators on the agreement they have reached with regard to the budget and its changes. The draft 2008 budget, in its Sustainable Growth part, makes it possible even for the newest EU Member States to achieve the goals facing them in connection with their membership. The operational programmes within the framework of the Structural Funds ensure high quality and qualifications of human resources, competitiveness, improvement of the infrastructure, strengthening of the administrative capacity in transport, the environment, etc. Regrettably, the available resources are less than what is needed.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I wish to express my support also for the strategic increase of payments to the Structural Funds, the Social and Cohesion Funds, because this will enable them to expand the operational programmes and their capabilities. I support also the 30-percent reserve for the administrative expenditures line because I believe this is a way to ensure efficiency of expenditures and control over spending.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The draft 2008 budget pays attention also to the new regions that have joined the EU. In the Black Sea Region, these are Bulgaria and Romania which are also borders of the European Union. The policy of the EU and the national governments is aimed at transforming the region into an area of security, stability and goodneighbourliness. The region needs improvement of the infrastructure, more investment, and adequate measures to protect the environment because of its high industrialisation and its transformation into a transfer zone for raw materials in the energy sector. The European Union with its policy and financing should guarantee both the environmental security and the stability and security of energy supplies to Europe.. The Black Sea Monitoring and the Framework Programme for the Black Sea Development is a pilot project which I am confident that the European Parliament will support; it is a right step towards good development of the Black Sea region and towards integration of the citizens of the Black Sea region into the EU membership policy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to speak about the impact of the EU budget on the wellbeing of the ordinary citizens of Europe, some of whom are following our debates today. Very often we hear that the European Union must develop into the world’s most competitive economy, and the budget can facilitate that. However, it should be restructured in order to be more efficient and should encourage scientific research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Regrettably, in reality it appears that the European Commission does not even have a definition of what constitutes scientific research. Various projects have different expenditures set to be financed according to the research and innovation programme.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We constantly speak about Europe and its influence in the world. The 27-strong newly enlarged European Union is capable of making changes on a world scale. The budget allows substantial funding for aid for third countries. However, according to the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors, the funds are very often used inefficiently.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The reason for this is because most of the countries to which we give our aid are governed by non-democratic regimes. Human rights are being abused and aid projects help a handful of people to get richer rather than improve the wellbeing of ordinary people.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would therefore like to urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that we adhere to the condition defined in our documents, in particular that aid programmes should be allocated in line with the promotion of democracy and human rights.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, thank you to the whole budget team for their good work. Please allow me a few remarks from the point of view of the Committee on Regional Development.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its estimates, the Commission evaluated the need for finance and, in harmony with the threshold values of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the terms of the financial perspective, took into account the likely applications for the current period. Thus, logically, the commitments within the framework of the Structural Funds for 2008 increase by 0.9%, and payments by 3.2%, while monies for the Cohesion Fund increase by 14.4% for commitments and 36% for payments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since the Commission is, in fact, the only institution that has unrestricted access to the required information in connection with overall financial requirement, our Committee was guided by the Commission’s proposal and also unanimously and immediately corrected unjustified amendments undertaken by the Council in its draft budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Above and beyond our amendments, we also simplified the administration and made the use of the funds more efficient, particularly against a background of the Lisbon and Göteborg goals. We focused on the unique status of small and medium-sized enterprises and traditional small business activities such as research and development. Not least, we considered it important to make special mention of the JEREMIE and JESSICA initiatives, to mention but two of the many key points in regional policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also support the Commission in facing the future demographic challenges in Europe, particularly that in some regions and even in entire Member States, population ageing has become a major problem due to declining birth rates. Family values must be promoted, for example by helping young women to balance family and career responsibilities. This is forward-looking policy, which must also be reflected in the key areas of regional policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, a Europe anchored in solidarity: that is what we want. The 2008 budget contains some new elements that further demonstrate this. A more modern budget is also needed, however: one that is in keeping with the knowledge-based economy – and anchored in solidarity. At the initiative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, more financial assistance is to be provided to Palestine and Kosovo. This is essential, however complex.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are other issues, too, where Europe must show solidarity. Support is needed for the Global Health Fund and for my initiative to reinforce sexual and reproductive health and rights in poor countries, examples being the reduction of maternal mortality and the right to an abortion. This supports the emancipation of women, thus aiding the development of poor countries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Solidarity is also relevant when it comes to the reorganisation of the EU budget. The best way of doing this, of course, is to reduce agricultural subsidies, which is eminently feasible now that prices are high. Europe must invest in new technology, and Galileo has shown that there is room for another budget. We can live with lower agricultural subsidies, whilst Galileo stands for increased employment and innovation.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you Mr President. The adoption of the budget each year is one of the most important duties we MEPs have. It is one of the few opportunities we have to send a very clear, collective message about what kind of EU we in Parliament want to see. Generally, I think that it is good that an increasing number of my fellow Members here in the Chamber seem to see the importance of holding back EU funds, but there is still much to be done. I think that it is important for us to set the right priorities in the budget, but the work on monitoring the money and its use is as important as budgeting for the right purposes. If we are doing it today, I think that unfortunately in many areas we are seeing that some of our money almost does more harm than good. In addition, the institutions must develop the EU’s accounting system so that it is easier to understand and monitor the money, so that we can see both beforehand and afterwards how it is actually spent. It is a question of transparency.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Personally, I would hope that the 2008 EU budget would signal more clearly an EU that prioritises, an EU that focuses on its core task – to create free movement of goods, services, persons and capital. But unfortunately this year’s draft budget leaves much to be desired in this respect. Let me just take a few brief examples: grants for silkworm breeding, bee-keeping, cotton farming, energy crops, figs, hemp, nuts, olive groves, rice cultivation, and tobacco. Export subsidies for cereals, sugar and products from the wine sector. Altogether, these budget headings amount to more than EUR 1 858 436 000. Aside from the fact that the budget headings, in my view, are an incredible waste of European taxpayers’ money, they are doing more harm than good. They affect people outside the Union. Nevertheless, one of the most serious examples is, I think, the EU’s export assistance for agriculture, where the EU subsidises its own agriculture sector and thereby dumps goods and prices on the markets of poor countries. This invalidates the poor countries’ natural competitive advantages and is a serious obstacle on their path to prosperity. We have to do something about this, not in 2013 but next year. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="el">Allow me to stress just two points relevant to both this Chamber and all countries.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Parliament emphasises in paragraph 24 of its resolution the need for the Commission to approve as quickly as possible the national operational plans of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and of the Structural Funds. Correct timing is particularly important, especially after the recent widespread natural disasters in southern European countries, particularly in Greece, where the resources to rectify the damage done have to be speedily provided.</p>
      <p sl="el">My second point is about the recent crisis in cereals prices, which have caused an upheaval in the cereals market and have upset agricultural revenue. This has led to an evident saving of resources in the Community budget. Let me point out, however, that under no circumstances should these savings be made available for other policies; they must stay within the CAP framework and be used to manage crises in the agricultural sector, for example.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets recommends for the first reading in the Plenary a 2008 budget of EUR 129.6 billion for commitments and EUR 124.2 billion for payments, with strict observance of all our agreements and commitments, both from the multi-annual programmes and the financial perspective and, I might add, well below the ceilings that we agreed in this multi-year plan, in a spirit of budgetary discipline and, at the same time, linked with an offer to the Council to resolve current issues such as Galileo and the financing of foreign and security policy sustainably. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Itälä and Mr Virrankoski, who, together with the coordinators and staff, did an excellent job preparing for the first reading.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the Parliament budget. Between the vote by the Committee on Budgets and the vote in the Plenary, a process of conciliation has been under way in consultation with the Bureau of this House, with close involvement by the administration. As part of this process, we were able to resolve several contradictory positions judiciously and satisfactorily. However, I would like to add at this point that a Bureau and an administration must be willing to face questions and criticism from the Committee on Budgets, as that is part of our task. Part of the conflict that we discuss every year was able to be resolved by creating a deadline of two to three weeks between presentation of the administrative proposal on the Parliament budget and the decision by the Bureau, to enable the Groups to be listened to more closely at the beginning of the process rather than at the end of the procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, in your letter dated 17 October, you again laid out the implementation of the budget as at the end of September. You showed where it was working well and where it was running into difficulty, where some programmes had possibly been implemented too late, and where the Commission itself had practised a little too much micromanagement regarding other questions for the Member States. However, overall, the report showed implementation has improved since the May report. If the Commission now wishes to remain credible, it can no longer claim late implementation or other difficulties for 2008 to justify being in arrears with payments or commitments in the implementation of the 2008 budget.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today we can say that, with the agreement between the institutions on the agencies – starting with the German Presidency and concluded by the Portuguese Presidency – and thanks to the exceptional work done by our permanent rapporteur Jutta Haug, the development of the agencies has been firmly re-established so that, in future, no agencies will be set up without adequate cost-benefit analyses and without clarifying whether they add any value. Therefore this must be continued in the code of conduct that is being agreed for the executive agencies. At this point, Commissioner, I must also say that this year, we dealt very circumspectly with the Commission’s administration budget, but that does not have to be the case every year. However, the continued assessment of staff positions, screening, development – prudently and without exaggeration, but carried out very transparently – those stay on the agenda for us.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have taken a very clear position on Galileo. When we talked about the Reform Treaty this morning and gave it solid support, then in future that will be called the Community method. If Member States believe they can rely on a hodgepodge of financing or on financing outside the Community budget then, in the light of this development in Europe, that is simply absurd and does not make sense.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my second point I would like to speak about the financing of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Without Parliament, the CFSP would already be bankrupt, for we would have to front up with approximately EUR 90 million, according to the Decision of the Heads of State or Government in December 2005. When I now hear that we may have to go well beyond what the Council and the Commission put forward to us, with Palestine and Kosovo to be added as well, then we are prepared to find a way through. Obviously we will also have to talk about the flexibility instrument, on the basis of the vote. This also applies to further acknowledgement of Parliament’s interests, as expressly – and correctly – called for by the Committee on Development.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Presidency must realise that, with the exception of Galileo and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, everything can be decided by Parliament on its own. Therefore my urgent recommendation: the Council needs to get a sufficient mandate so that we can put both Galileo and the Foreign and Security Policy on a firm footing – hopefully not only for 2008. If this is not achieved, then we are all going to have to have further sittings during the 2008 budget. The door is open for all negotiations, but we expect a clear signal from the Council that it is taking action on these two key questions. Either way, from the point of view of this Parliament, there will be a 2008 budget.</p>

      <p sl="en">The first action undertaken by the European Commission in relation to this was to support, in 2001, the creation of a European network of organisations, the European Federation on Missing and Sexually Exploited Children, which is now called Missing Children Europe. To date, we have 21 organisations in 15 Member States.</p>

To that end, the Decision of 15 February 2007 on reserving the national numbering range beginning with ‘116’ for harmonised numbers for harmonised services of social value will be implemented. This is an important decision by each Member State, particularly in relation to the 116000 number for hotlines to report missing children.</p>
      <p sl="en">You know that putting in place the services corresponding to a 116 number remains the responsibility of Member States. There, unfortunately, I have to say that three Member States have not yet responded. Legal measures have been taken by 17 Member States. There have been calls for candidates for the management of the hotline numbers in 12 Member States, and only four Member States have so far chosen service providers: Belgium, Denmark, Greece and Portugal. So I am not at all satisfied at the state of play in implementation of the decision taken in February 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to these emergency phone numbers, a mechanism of assistance in the search for missing children is necessary. Several systems already exist and can serve as an inspiration for a Europe-wide action. You know about the American system, ‘Amber Alert’, the French ‘Alerte enlèvement ’ and the Greek ‘Amber Alert Hellas’ system, which are already in place. We support Member States in putting similar mechanisms in place nationally. Provided that all Member States adopt such mechanisms and that interconnection schemes are put in place, resolving cross-border cases would be possible and easier. To that end, we have drafted guidelines describing our idea for a Europe-wide child alert mechanism. The issue was discussed for the first time at the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council on 1 October 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we support the creation of an international database of child abuse images, which will be a new tool to help identify victims and criminals. The feasibility study and implementation phase are funded by the AGIS programme and, since September 2005, this database used by Interpol is funded mainly by G8 governments and private companies. So far this database has made it possible to locate and arrest several criminals in Europe and outside Europe, most recently a very well-known paedophile in Thailand, and save victims.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, thank you very much for enabling us to be face to face with the Commissioner, whom I have already asked many questions on similar matters.</p>
      <p sl="es">The issue of missing children is a distressing one. For example, in my islands alone, the Canaries, three children have disappeared in recent years without a trace, meaning that they have not even appeared in paedophile networks. They disappear completely, which leads us to wonder whether these children are used for certain purposes such as, for example, trade in organs, and whether mafia organisations with possible international connections are operating within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">This makes me think that this is a matter that requires an initiative that is somewhat more ambitious than those that the Commission has undertaken so far. I know that the Commissioner has always been ambitious, but I also invite him to be ambitious in this area, as it is a distressing matter for parents and for society in general, because children are the most precious thing that we have.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Medina, I fully concur with your wishes and I can tell you how dissatisfied I am to see that even when we adopt initiatives, the Member States do not implement them.</p>
      <p sl="it">The idea of a single telephone number in Europe for urgent calls should have been specifically implemented by each Member State by the end of September. This is now the end of October, and only four Member States have a functioning system; the other 17 have adopted initiatives but are still lagging behind.</p>
      <p sl="it">The other proposal that we want to make is for closer cooperation to monitor what is commonly referred to as ‘sex tourism’. Unfortunately many European citizens apparently travel as tourists to other parts of the world to commit horrible acts of paedophilia, and in this area I agree that international collaboration must be stepped up. I agree with you – and sadly we have proof – that missing children are often used for organ trafficking. Unfortunately this applies not only to my own region, but to other regions very close to the European Union, such as the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the Black Sea.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, organ trafficking is a reality, not to mention the discovery of organ trafficking of adults and children from the Far East and South-east Asia. Obviously, even though this is an area which until now national governments have not been willing to hand over to the EU, it may soon be handled more effectively by the European Union, partly as a result of the adoption of the agreement on the new institutional treaty.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 42 by Milan Gala (H-0738/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Tropical virus chikungunya in Europe</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Italian authorities, using the European early warning system, have informed the other EU Member States of a tropical fever epidemic caused by the chikungunya virus in the province of Emilia-Romagna. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warns that climatic conditions are favourable for the continued presence of this vector over the next few months, particularly in Mediterranean countries, and that there is a high risk of the virus spreading to other European countries where the climatic conditions are favourable for its survival. At a time of marked change in climatic conditions and high levels of mobility, is the Commission preparing a scenario on how to deal with a possible tropical fever epidemic on a larger scale?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-274" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Markos Kyprianou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Actually, I had some problems pronouncing it myself. To begin with, I had hoped it would be eradicated without my having to learn how to pronounce it, but unfortunately it is becoming persistent so we now have to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I had the opportunity yesterday, during the one minute speeches, to hear the Honourable Member’s intervention on this issue, and I share his concerns. One could say that, relatively speaking, we have a low number of infections – for example, about 250 in Italy as compared to more than 150 000 on the island of Réunion a few years ago. However, the worrying thing is the trend. What is actually raising our concerns is the fact that we now have tropical diseases spreading in Europe as a combination of climate change, which of course helps the proliferation and survival of the vector, and at the same time increased mobility, which allows the introduction of the virus via the movement of people coming from the tropics.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was important for us to take immediate measures. From the beginning the Italian authorities reacted correctly, rapidly and effectively, so one can now say that the situation is at a much lower level, even though we still have on-going cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first thing the Commission did was to take various measures, using existing instruments or adjusting these to deal with the situation. First of all we made sure that we offered technical support through the European Centre for Disease Control, once again proving the wise choice of the European Union in establishing such a centre.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now had to deal with this new threat and new form of challenge. We adapted our legislation and included vector-borne diseases in the list of diseases to be addressed as a priority. At the same time we asked Member States – and this is a legal obligation on them – to notify the Commission and other Member States through the early-warning response system. It is very important to be able to detect cases as soon as possible in order to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), in addition to the case definitions, also produced standard operating procedures and is updating them regularly. Very importantly, we upgraded and strengthened laboratory capacity in order to detect and identify the chikungunya virus. We did this through the European Network for Diagnostics of ‘Imported’ Viral Diseases, which is funded under the public health programme. Also, through the same programme, we are funding joint activities with Member States to further strengthen preparedness for public health emergencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We had the opportunity to discuss in plenary a communication and action plan on generic preparedness, which was adopted in 2005. The system is in place and we can use it of course, and it has been used, but we will of course adapt it and adjust it to be able to deal with this form of health threat as well. Information for the public is very important, and is something we also do through the ECDC, both for the areas affected and also for travellers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Technical guidance documents on the rapid detection of cases of chikungunya fever are in place, as the cornerstone for an effective epidemiological surveillance. Also, the ECDC has produced a robust package of technical guidance documents: information for health care workers; case definitions for chikungunya fever; and flow charts for identification of cases. These are available and are currently being used by the competent authorities to facilitate decision-making processes at national level.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also dealing immediately with the issue of blood safety, which is an important factor as well, with the cooperation of the national competent authorities. However, if the situation persists, my services are ready to adopt a new donor-deferral rule for this disease as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new public programme and other instruments will also fund research in addressing many issues related to vector-borne diseases, as we also need to look at the issue of the insects themselves, and of course at global change through projects like Eden, which concerns emerging diseases in a changing European environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this demonstrates how climate change has an immediate effect on health. In parallel, I should mention that we also have problems in animal health which have developed because of climate change. The European Commission is planning to adopt a communication next year dealing with that aspect of climate change too.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Commissioner, thank you for your competent reply and congratulations to the Italian authorities for their appropriate action. Looking at the whole matter, I find it somewhat strange that no vaccine against the chikungunya virus is available yet, even though, according to some data, up to 1 million people were infected with the virus in Africa. I understand this to some extent when it comes to bird flu because in that case a virus that can be transmitted has not been isolated yet and therefore we cannot develop a vaccine. However, in this case we seem to have a virus that can be identified by serologic and other methods, and a serum or vaccine against it could now be developed. If the virus happened to spread, such a serum or vaccine would be an effective treatment against the chikungunya virus and perhaps also against an even worse infection: dengue fever.</p>

    <intervention id="2-276" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Markos Kyprianou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">First of all, the reference to dengue fever is also important because the same insect could also transmit the dengue disease to fresh meat, so this is also a concern for us. That is why we are preparing a report to deal with insect-borne diseases, because climate change helps their proliferation, as I said earlier, but also – because we have mild winters – the survival of insects which then transmit disease.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are right; there is no vaccination, which is a shame. The fact is that there is research on-going but I have to say at this point that we are quite far from having any results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, that is an issue we will be raising also with the WHO and will try, through our various instruments and policies, to encourage the development of these vaccines.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I may, I would like to also add one of my personal views, one I have been raising with the Member States since the first discussions on avian flu: not only do we have a responsibility of solidarity towards developing countries, towards third countries in helping them deal with the health threat, but it is also a form of self-defence and we have to realise that we cannot consider ourselves as immune and protected in our cosy area here in the European Union. We are not! Therefore, it is very important to deal with the health threats all over the world as threats for the European Union as well and making it as one of our priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The health strategy that we adopted today in the Commission will be sent to Parliament to be discussed with you as well. It includes a very important global aspect of the European Union’s health policies, and I am optimistic that we can change and correct the situation through this new approach.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Humanitarian disaster in Iraq</p>
      <p sl="unknown">With the closure of the Syrian border, the sole remaining means of escape for thousands of Iraqi refugees, including very large families and thus large numbers of children, was cut off.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In addition to ethnic cleansing – often encouraged with the active involvement of the Iraqi authorities – we now have a serious cholera epidemic directly linked to the appalling health conditions prevailing in much of the country.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The Commission's response to the humanitarian disaster in Iraq has been totally insignificant and is in direct conflict with European values.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission plan to support the Iraqi population fleeing within or outside Iraq?</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission plan to support frontline countries such as Jordan, which are having to bear the consequences of this situation disproportionately?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-278" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Neelie Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission is fully aware of the scale of the humanitarian needs inside Iraq and its neighbouring countries. The Commission’s response to this crisis is twofold. Firstly, in order to support the refugees from Iraq and neighbouring countries, the Commission has immediately responded with the financial decision on EUR 6.2 million in humanitarian aid, adopted in May 2007, to address the most urgent needs of the refugees. That assistance will be further increased to EUR 7 million by the end of 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has engaged with the governments of Syria and Jordan, which bear most of the burden of the refugee crisis, to develop assistance programmes. Those governments have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes, implemented via international organisations and NGOs. They expect the international community to support their national systems, mainly in the fields of education and health, as these systems also benefit Iraqi refugees.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consequently, the Commission has identified quick impact projects for a total of EUR 37.7 million, for which the Commission is in the process of consulting Member States. All these actions form the Commission’s immediate response to the refugees’ most pressing needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission realises that they only partially alleviate the enormous suffering and the pressure on the institutions and social fabric of neighbouring countries, and that is why it is currently further developing its response strategy in order to match it with appropriate funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, as far as the situation inside Iraq is concerned, the Commission is supporting the International Committee of the Red Cross with, so far, EUR 4 million, and is currently identifying additional solid and acceptable partners operational in Iraq with a view to increasing its level of assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has to be acknowledged that while there are significant humanitarian needs, there are also significant impediments to the delivery of humanitarian aid. These are severe security concerns and problems of access that prevent the Commission and any other donor from allocating funds which are truly commensurate with the level of needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is in fact a dearth of humanitarian partners able to operate and implement programmes inside Iraq that properly address the needs of the most vulnerable people.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission would like to recall that it is the main financial contributor to the international reconstruction fund facility for Iraq, with a contribution of EUR 123 million. That is, by the way, 46 % of the total contributions to date. Since 2003, the Commission has committed over EUR 800 million in Iraq.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your clarifications, but may I remind you that Iraqi refugees in Egypt are already estimated to number 200 000; the European Commission is not offering anything for Egypt. The University of Amman has just conducted a study which estimates that Jordan has more than a million refugees – an absolutely catastrophic macroeconomic impact; the European Commission is not taking any steps to address this. Even Israel is setting up a quite remarkable medical assistance programme for Iraqi children. As for Syria, I am not a party to the talks that the Commission has been holding with Syria, but I have often spoken with the Syrian authorities: the fact is that they already have perhaps 2 million more inhabitants. Today, Madam President, allow me just to remind you of this, today, right now, in Rabiah, on the border between Syria and Iraq, a huge humanitarian disaster is developing: thousands of Iraqis, who heard a rumour that the borders were about to open, have gathered there and cannot enter. The situation is absolutely tragic and we can no longer ignore what is going on.</p>

    <intervention id="2-281" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Neelie Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I have already mentioned that the governments, especially the Syrian Government, which the honourable Member referred to, have clearly indicated that they were not in favour of external humanitarian assistance programmes implemented via the international organisations and NGOs. So the amount of assistance provided reflects the reluctance of the Syrian and Jordanian authorities to let international non-state actors, such as the UN and NGOs, intervene in their respective countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our assistance can only be directed through organisations that are accepted by the local authorities and have sufficient operational capacity. This imposes a natural limit on what we can do. We are, however, working on capacity-building programmes and engaging in direct dialogue with the Jordanian and Syrian authorities to strengthen our implementing capacity in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">It should be noted, if I may say so, that the Iraqi Government itself seems very reluctant to assist its neighbours. The Iraqi Government has repeatedly declared it will allocate USD 25 million to assist Iraqi refugees. However, although commitments were made at the Sharm el-Sheikh Conference last May and relations were strengthened between Iraqi, Syrian and Jordanian officials, it seems as though Iraq is not cooperating sufficiently. We therefore have to ask the Iraqi Government to assume at least its financial responsibility for its own citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The lack of coordination among UN agencies in managing humanitarian crises is of high concern. We note strong competition – and it is awful to say so – between the UN humanitarian agencies, instead of close cooperation. We hope that the appointment of a new humanitarian coordinator will improve the ability of our UN partners to address the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">That is not an easy question. The Commission condemns all terrorist attacks as criminal and unjustifiable under any circumstances. Having said that, we regret the suffering caused by those actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turkey faces continual cross-border terrorist attacks from the PKK, which is on the EU’s list of terrorist organisations, as you are aware. The Commission understands Turkey’s need to protect its citizens but we continue to urge Turkey and Iraq to tackle the problem through cooperation between the relevant authorities and by respecting international law. In this context, the recent bilateral agreement between Turkey and Iraq on the fight against terrorism is a welcome step.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU and Turkey have regularly reiterated that they remain committed to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. We expect Turkey to continue to play a constructive role in order to reach those objectives and promote regional cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, let us take into account the pressure from the Turkish public, which is faced with killings of soldiers and civilians in the south-east of the country almost every week. The Government has to show its willingness and ability to take more effective action.</p>
      <p sl="en">As many of our Member States know well, it is very difficult to tackle terrorists effectively. The Turkish authorities are understandably trying to engage the US, Iraqi and Iraq’s Kurdish authorities in their efforts. It is the only way. The resolution passed in Parliament and the building-up of a credible threat of intervention should be seen as a part of that strategy.</p>

      <p sl="en">It has been drawn to the attention of the honourable Member that the detailed answers provided below relate only to the Commission, which is of course by far the major employer amongst European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the purposes of Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work is to establish a framework to prevent the abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships.</p>
      <p sl="en">To prevent abuse, clause 5(1) obliges Member States, where there are no actual legal measures to prevent abuse, to introduce one or more of the following measures to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term contracts:</p>
      <p sl="en">(a) objective reasons justifying the renewal of such contracts and relationships;</p>
      <p sl="en">(b) the maximum total duration of fixed-term contracts or relationships;</p>
      <p sl="en">(c) the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rules governing the employment of staff in the European Institutions are laid down in the Staff Regulations, which were discussed with staff representatives before being adopted by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Institutions are thus bound by law to respect the provisions of these Staff Regulations. The Staff Regulations allow the European Institutions to recruit three main types of staff: permanent officials, temporary agents and contract agents.</p>
      <p sl="en">Temporary agents and permanent officials occupy a post in the establishment plan. There is no limit to the level of responsibility which permanent officials and temporary agents can exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation for contract agents is different. They do not occupy a post in the establishment plan and they must work under the supervision of a permanent official or a temporary agent. There are two distinct categories of contract agents. One category of contract agent was created to perform tasks which are non-core and which do not necessarily need to be performed by an official. Such contract agents can be offered permanent contracts so their tasks can be considered as permanent in nature.</p>
      <p sl="en">The spirit of Directive 1999/70/EC is followed for such staff as they are generally offered a first contract for a fixed term, an extension for a fixed term and a third contract for an indefinite period. In some cases a permanent contract can be offered directly upon recruitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are currently around 2 300 such contract agents working for the Commission around the world, mainly in delegations, representations and administrative offices.</p>
      <p sl="en">A second category of contract agents exists to cover temporary or specialist needs not covered by existing posts, and to substitute staff temporarily absent, among others on maternity or parental leave. By limiting to three years the maximum total duration of successive, fixed-term employment contracts in any one institution, the staff regulations give de facto effect to clause 5(1)(b).</p>
      <p sl="en">Such contract agents represent approximately 15% of the total staff. It is clear that permanent officials are the mainstay of the Commission staff. Contract agents provide valuable support on a temporary basis to the work of Commission officials. There are currently around 3 200 such contract agents working for the Commission in its different sites.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 45 by Johan Van Hecke (H-0718/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Impact of the growing number of EU officials on pension costs</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the last seven years the number of permanent employees in the Commission has apparently risen by some 16% to almost 20 000 officials. At the start of this year, following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, more than 700 officials were recruited with the task of strengthening the internal market. Clearly, the growing number of EU officials has implications for the budget, and above all an alarming increase in pension costs may be expected. In 2008 pension costs apparently rose by more than 10%, at the expense, of course, of European taxpayers.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission see growth in the number of Commission officials in the near future? Has a form of freeze on the number of officials already been considered? Is the Commission aware of the financial implications, above all as far as pension costs are concerned?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-292" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Siim Kallas" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Pension rights and the pension system are, of course, one of the most complicated things in all Europe. First of all, it should be mentioned that the 2007 budget provides for 23 198 posts for the Commission. This question contains two sub-questions: on the action taken by the Commission in terms of recruitment in order to limit the implications of the growing number of EU officials on the budget and on the impact of the growing number of EU officials on pension costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the first sub-question, it must be recalled that the reform of the Staff Regulations was put in place in 2004, inter alia , in order to curtail budgetary costs linked to the increase in institution staff. The new career and promotion structure and the new staff category of contractual agents were introduced with a view to having a positive impact on the budget. On the other hand, the honourable Member might be aware that, during the 2007 budgetary procedure, the European Parliament asked the Commission to carry out a substantive screening exercise providing a mid-term evaluation of its staff needs and a detailed report on the Commission’s staffing for support and coordination functions. The European Parliament also wanted to be informed about the Commission’s intentions concerning staff redeployment to address the priorities of the new Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and, more particularly, those policies supported by Parliament during the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a result of the screening of the Commission’s human resources carried out at the request of the European Parliament, the Commission confirms the need identified in 2002 and 2005 for additional staff exclusively in relation to enlargement-related tasks: 890 new staff for 2008, broken down as 640 new staff for EU-10 enlargement and 250 posts for EU-2 enlargement. For 2009, there is a confirmed need for a last wave of 250 posts for EU-2 enlargement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission endorses the decision to maintain stable staffing once all enlargement-related personnel are integrated, with no requests for new posts for the period 2009-2013. The Commission commits to meet new staffing needs in key policy areas exclusively through redeployment within and between departments. The Commission is committed to delivering the highest standards of value for money to the citizens it serves, delivering high quality service through increased efficiency. The Commission has already shown its commitment to these goals in practice. Over the period 2000-2007, figures show that the increase of establishment plan posts within the Commission is lower than in the other institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the second sub-question, it should be noted that the recruitment for the period 2004-2008 due to enlargement will only have an effect on the pension costs in 30 years, meaning that, in the near future, enlargement will have no impact on pension costs. Nevertheless, the Commission is extremely attentive to the growth of pension costs in the coming years. In the budget pension costs were expected to increase by 10% in 2008. This is due to exceptional circumstances. The higher-than-average increase in 2008 is a normal rebound after the lower-than-average increases for both 2006 and 2007. There will be the first round of departures of contract agents, whose contribution will have to be transferred to another scheme, and 3% annual expected increase of salaries and pensions. Even with this exception, we estimate that the growth rate of pensions for the 2007-2013 period is compatible with an 8.5% average increase in expenditure taken into account for the 2007-2013 financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the long-term financial effects of the current wave of recruitments, the impact was analysed when preparing the reform of the Staff Regulations. Measures have been taken to reduce the pension costs and the Staff Regulations require that the pension contribution rate paid by the employees, currently 10.25%, is updated yearly so that it corresponds to one-third of the total contribution required to guarantee the long-term equilibrium of the Community pension schemes.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I am a municipal councillor in a Belgian municipality with 13 000 inhabitants. The supervisory authority does not approve the budget of this small municipality unless a staffing requirement schedule is supplied, complete with detailed budget. A 16% increase in the number of officials for some years, as in the EU, would never be authorised; nor would an increase in pension costs of more than 10% in one year. The Commissioner has pointed to enlargement, but despite that enlargement the number of MEPs has been reduced. My question is: does the Commissioner not think that it is high time to also consider a freeze on the number of staff, in spite of possible further enlargement?</p>

      <p sl="en">Yes, but as I said there will be a staff freeze after the enlargement, so this comparison with a municipality is not a similar situation. We have a big political project – the enlargement of the European Union – and we have taken on new officials. This has been the same model as during all previous enlargements. We have been quite successful in recruiting people from new Member States, and this will be frozen. After that, the overall number will be frozen.</p>

This system is quite detailed and developed.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are right also in asking about the quality of the staff. Concerning the average open competition or ‘concours ’, there are approximately 42 serious applicants – not to mention other applicants – to each published post.

      <p sl="en">Like the Council, the Commission has concluded an agreement with its staff trade unions, putting a certain amount of human resources at their disposal. In the case of the Commission, on the basis of the resources agreement of 2001 and annual resources protocols, 12 so-called secondment posts are granted to the trade unions on a permanent basis out of a total of more than 23 000 posts at the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such secondments to trade unions, on the basis of their representativity, have been allowed since 1989. Furthermore, a very limited number of posts are granted on a flexible basis, in particular in order to account for changing majorities after elections. The staff thus put at the disposal of the trade unions continue to be paid a salary from the EU budget as Commission staff. In addition, the trade unions receive a budget which allows them to recruit up to nine contractual agents from Function Group II (secretaries).</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission indicate the sum total of the fines it has imposed on businesses under European competition rules since the beginning of its current term in office and whether any measures have been taken or whether there have been any consultations within the Commission with a view to reserving this money - less the relevant amounts budgeted - for additional EU activities rather than transferring the extra revenue to the Member States?</p>

      <p sl="en">Since the beginning of its current term and up to the end of September 2007, the Commission has adopted 21 decisions imposing fines on companies that have infringed the anti-trust rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">The total fines imposed during that period amount to just over EUR 5.2 billion, 95% of which has been imposed on cartel participants.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it should be borne in mind that such fines become part of the European budget only once they are final: that is, if no appeal has been lodged by the undertaking on which a fine has been imposed or when all possible appeals have been rejected by the European courts.</p>
      <p sl="en">As companies frequently challenge the validity of the Commission decisions imposing fines, a large part of the amount mentioned above is not final, so to speak.</p>
      <p sl="en">The possible use of the proceeds of fines for additional activities, as suggested by the honourable Member, is prevented by legal constraints. Such use would run counter to the budgetary principle of universality as set out in Articles 17 to 20 of the current Financial Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to that principle, total revenue covers total expenditure without any specific link between a given item of revenue and a given item of expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The basic objective of anti-trust fines as laid out in the preamble to the 2006 guidelines on the method of setting fines is to ensure deterrence, in other words to discourage companies from behaving illegally.</p>
      <p sl="en">In time it is to be hoped that the levels of abuse, and hence the number and volume of fines imposed, will decrease as complying levels increase and we are still doing our job properly.</p>

      <p sl="en">They also mention that damage to reputation, in combination with the fines, is a very important part of their attitude and their struggle to clean up the companies.

      <p sl="en">The Commission decision on the merger provides that the parties must proceed with the divesture of their ownership, including a partial divesture of participation in Fluxys, and with the other commitments, including those relating to Fluxys governance, within a certain divesture period.

      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Subsidy to Volvo Cars Ghent / EU rules on State aid</p>
      <p sl="unknown">On 12 September 2007, the Commission announced an inquiry into the compatibility with EU rules on State aid of a planned subsidy of € 6.02 m from the Flemish Region for general and specific training costs at Volvo Cars Ghent; the subsidy would amount to 20% of the company's total training bill. The Commission states that it wishes to ensure that the aid is not used purely to subsidise training costs which the company would have incurred anyway. The Commission bases its intention on a very restrictive interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 .</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Can the Commission clarify how it intends to apply the EU rules on State aid in this case? What facts does the Commission take as a basis for claiming that the aid confers an unlawful competitive advantage and is therefore incompatible with EU rules on State aid?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-318" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Neelie Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission will analyse the planned subsidy to Volvo Cars in Ghent directly on the basis of the EC Treaty, since the matter exceeds the EUR 1 million ceiling laid down in the specific block exemption regulation on training aid. Article 87 of the Treaty provides that aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, and which does not unduly distort competition, may be considered compatible with the common market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Training aid can be permitted when it creates incentives for activities which will increase the pool of skilled workers in the European Union and which would not otherwise be undertaken. That is the case where the training goes beyond what is normally done in the sector concerned; for instance, because more workers are trained or because the training is more extensive. That was the situation, for instance, in the recent Fiat case.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, aid cannot be authorised for training that is an accessory for the good operation of the firm concerned and that would therefore be carried out even without aid. For instance, when a car assembly plant wants to produce a new model, workers have to be trained on the new techniques and new working methods to be adopted. Subsidising this type of training simply relieves the company from a cost it would normally bear. Accordingly, the Commission has in the recent past partially prohibited aid in favour of several assembly plants and you are certainly aware of General Motors in Belgium and Ford Genk.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed eight measures for Volvo Cars Ghent relate to the introduction of a new production platform. The Commission cannot, at this stage, exclude that the training concerned would take place in any case and therefore would not contribute to increasing the pool of skilled workers in the EU. Therefore, the Commission has decided to open a formal investigation that is without prejudice to the final decision in the case. We need more time to find out what it is all about. The Belgian authorities, the beneficiary, as well as third parties, will have the opportunity to comment and to submit information before a final decision is taken.</p>

Moving on to what I wanted to say, as I understand it, then, the matter is still being dealt with. Am I right in thinking that the new interpretation of the rules on State aid for training will also contain sufficient scope for social relevance in training courses ensuring that, if training gives workers more opportunities in the global labour market, this training aid will not be regarded as a major interference in competition?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 53 by Georgios Papastamkos (H-0682/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Trade and climate change</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The EU is - quite rightly - at the forefront of political action to tackle climate change. However, its efforts alone are patently insufficient. Nor should we overlook the competitive disadvantage of European enterprises and the threat of relocation and job losses. Commissioner Mandelson has opted in favour of an approach based on providing incentives for 'clean' trade.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Is the Commission also considering the possibility of deploying trade protection measures against, for instance, its partners which fail to implement the Kyoto Protocol? What initiatives does it intend to take to address the problem of environmental dumping and to ensure reciprocity between the EU and its trading partners as regards compliance with environmental standards at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-322" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time; it hardly needs restating here. It is not a trade issue first and foremost, but there are areas where trade can help. That is why the Commission wants the Doha Round to deliver liberalisation of environmental goods and services and also sees scope for the new generation of free trade agreements to help facilitate sustainable trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is aiming to negotiate an ambitious and comprehensive post-2012 climate framework. If we succeed in including all major players, we will have gone some way, the furthest we could, to obtaining a level playing field for EU industry. That also means that the carbon leakage – the displacement of pollution from one place to another – that might otherwise flow from a failure to reach agreement will be avoided. Our aim is to include all major polluters in a proportionate way and not to frighten away partners from the negotiating table in Bali, and later on, by preparing trade measures for imports at this stage. We should rather address the free rider issue when, and only if, it actually arises.</p>
      <p sl="en">A well-designed trade policy can help the world deal with climate change by generating the wealth needed to pay for the mitigation and adaptation measures required. Investment in trade, in both low-carbon goods and services, can carry skills and climate-friendly technology throughout the global economy, helping to address climate change at global level and in the most cost-efficient manner. Throwing that away would be doing a disservice to climate change policy. It should not be forgotten that our approach to climate change policy has helped put European industry at the forefront when it comes to environmental low-carbon technology. The EU has a considerable first-mover advantage as a result.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Stern report made clear that combating climate change makes economic sense, in addition to the numerous societal benefits, because the costs involved are lower than the costs of inaction. Trade policy can support climate change objectives by minimising those costs and generating part of the finance required and by fostering regulatory frameworks that support investment and trade in low-carbon goods, services and technology.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner Mandelson certainly seems to respect the time limit for questions. He hardly confines himself to formalistic replies.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today, Commissioner, we adopted the new framework for placing plant protection products on the market. The entry into force of this framework will have consequences on the primary production of agricultural products and by extension on the European food industry. Can you confirm to us that imported products are subject to effective checks to see whether they comply with the strict specifications imposed on domestic production?</p>

      <p sl="en">We are indeed looking at all these aspects. But I would just reinforce the point I originally made: we want to secure the best, most far-reaching, most inclusive agreement for the post-2012 period that we possibly can.</p>
      <p sl="en">That requires a great deal of persuasion of our trading partners, the emerging economies, who we need to persuade to buy into and sign up to the post-2012 agreement that we all agree is greatly needed and which needs to have the maximum geographical coverage.</p>
      <p sl="en">The question we have to ask ourselves is with what tactics we can, or are most likely to, persuade emerging economies to sign up to the agreement that we want to promote.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our view, it would not only be premature, but it would be counterproductive, to start using a stick or threats or create a scenario in which those who might be inclined to hold back would be somehow punished by some trade measure or other because they fell into the category of free riders.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the time comes to reflect on such measures, then we would only approach that after considerable reflection and consultation, and, of course, any measure that we were even to contemplate would – and I have to stress this – need to be assessed for its WTO compatibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I would like to ask another question. My colleague Mr Papastamkos is absolutely right when he says that we must think about preventing European companies being disadvantaged if other countries do not participate in whatever follows the Kyoto system.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are three possibilities: firstly, the European Union could be the only one to commit to continuing. That would, of course, put companies under financial strain and disadvantage us. The second potential scenario is that if other countries do not participate, we will not participate either, although we would then be unable to meet the climate goals we have set ourselves. The third possibility, if the others do not join this ‘Kyoto plus’ or post-Kyoto system, would be for us to pass appropriate sanctions. What exactly might these sanctions look like? Can you imagine specific sanctions?</p>

We are a long way from considering the implications or consequences of certain nations declining to sign up to, and making, appropriate commitments. Therefore, to have a discussion tonight about sanctions is, as I say, not only premature but also quite possibly counter-productive.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the case that there are discussions going on within the Commission in the review of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and in the examination of the position, particularly, of energy-intensive industries under that scheme. The latter is fully taken into account in our common efforts to design an improved ETS, and the position of those industries will certainly be considered in the context of any international agreement that is negotiated and the implications for European industries, particularly energy-intensive ones, if we do not create the level playing field that we are seeking through negotiation.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Question No 54 by Daniel Caspary (H-0695/07)</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Subject: Discussion on the future of the trade defence instruments</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the vote on the Global Europe report on 22 May 2007, the European Parliament made clear its intention to maintain the current trade defence instruments and reject any relaxation in their application.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">How does the Commission intend to take this into account in its work on the future of the trade defence instruments? How is the contradiction between the statements by Commissioner Mandelson on the future of the trade defence instruments and the opinion of the European Parliament to be resolved?</p>

What will be the final proposal of the Commission considering the fact that the majority of stake holders seem not to support further liberalisation of this policy?</p>

    <intervention id="2-328" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">The Commission appreciates the interest shown by Parliament in a review of the trade defence instruments (TDIs) and reiterates the importance it attaches to the views of Parliament in the context of the current review. It looks forward to the report by the Committee on International Trade, which it hopes will be completed soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">On its side, the Commission is finalising its response to the consultation process. Indeed, the Commission held a preliminary discussion, an orientation debate, before its meeting today on this subject. Proposals to the Council could be made in the next weeks. The Commission intends to keep Parliament closely involved and informed on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has, of course, carefully examined all reactions to the Green Paper, of which there are many hundreds. The intention now is to inform Member States and Parliament of the main reactions and suggestions received, and these will also be published. They will be discussed by the Commission again before proposals are tabled to the Council, hopefully in the last half of November.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most stakeholders consulted and submitting their views share the Commission’s opinion that TDIs remain essential in a globalising world economy where multilaterally-agreed competition rules are lacking.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, the majority of stakeholders do not see the need for a major overhaul of the TDI system. Neither does the Commission. However, there is also a wish for the rules to be made clearer, as well as for increased transparency and for there to be more efficient application of the instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The claim that the Commission has changed its approach towards the assessment of Community interest in some recent cases is simply not true. Each case has been examined on the basis of its own technical merits. Some cases have raised atypical issues, but they have been resolved in line with Community legislation and within the small discretion allowed by that legislation, after thorough discussion with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, it is correct that no new anti-dumping investigations were initiated in the first half of 2007. However, it should be pointed out that anti-dumping investigations are industry-driven and are not initiated by us. In other words, they are initiated on the basis of complaints from Community industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the first six months of 2007, no complaints meeting the requirements of the law were lodged. It is not unusual that the number of initiations varies from one year to another, depending on factors such as the business cycle, over-capacity in third countries and diversion of trade as a result of trade defence measures in other world markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The number of initiations has also fluctuated in past years. In 2003, for example, the Commission initiated in total only eight new investigations, the first of which was initiated at the end of May in that year. Also, the first semester of 2007 followed a period of exceptionally high activity at the end of 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would draw your attention to the fact that in September 2007 two new anti-dumping investigations were initiated against imports from China: one for citric acid and another for monosodium glutamate.</p>

      <p sl="en">I can assure the honourable Member that information about the responses is – already, I believe – posted on the website of DG TRADE, but we shall also publish what is, I hope, an easily accessible version or presentation of the responses we have had to the Green Paper in order to allow good time for reflection on those responses to take place ahead of the submission by the Commission of our proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The honourable Member seems to have alighted already on certain aspects of the Commission’s proposals which have not yet been submitted to or agreed to by the Commission, so I suggest, with respect, that he is slightly jumping ahead of himself in some of the assumptions that he appears to be making.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The question I would like to ask is, obviously, based on my meetings and discussions with the industrialists of the country I represent – Lithuania. In fact, I can reiterate what my colleague has said: there is a lot of concern about the liberalisation of the trade policy, and also a lot of criticism. My question is: if the position remains the same, what will be the Commission’s reaction? What measures can the Commission be expected to take? Would you be inclined to listen to what business representatives have to say, or would you consider other arguments to be more important?</p>

    <intervention id="2-332" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I am not quite sure what the honourable Member means by the ‘liberalisation of our trade policy’. By definition, trade can only take place when markets are opened and trade flows are, in effect, being liberalised. Trade does not take place behind closed borders or where economies are being converted into fortresses, so of course the Commission seeks to promote the liberalisation of trade.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Global Europe trade policy review and strategy that was presented and agreed by the Commission and the Member States a year ago sets out very clearly the interests of the European Union, which are to maintain open markets at home, to promote and use multilateral and bilateral negotiations, to open markets abroad and to use effective trade defence measures to tackle unfair trade or unfair competition. Those are the three legs of our strategy; each is equally important.</p>
      <p sl="en">The review of the third leg of that tripod is taking place after quite dramatic changes have taken place in the world economy, and indeed in the European economy, since the last review of our trade defence measures took place, which was over 10 years ago. We have a responsibility to make sure that our measures are operating as well as they could be and that they command consensus and support and solidarity amongst our Member States. When that weakens, the trade defence measures become less easy or possible to use. It is in an effort to rebuild and restore that consensus, support and solidarity amongst our Member States that we are undertaking this review.</p>

Commissioner, European anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures represent less than 0.45% of the value of total imports into the EU. How, then, is the Commission’s haste for unilateral revision of trade defence policy justified? In which direction is the Commission leaning?

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to ask a question related to the answers you have been giving. Parliament does not acknowledge the need to review the trade defence instruments; the public consultation reached the same conclusion. The Commissioner has not explained to Parliament the point of his proposal and, especially, to what extent his proposals and convictions have changed on the basis of the opinion of the public hearing and the opinion of Parliament. This is the heart of the issue, because we do not understand the point of persisting with a review of instruments that everyone thinks are useful and are working well. This, then, is what we need to understand.</p>

    <intervention id="2-336" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I do not quite know what the change of direction is that the honourable Member is referring to; there is no change of direction and, as I have made clear, neither the stakeholders responding to the review nor the Commission takes the view that a fundamental overhaul or fundamental reform is needed. So, I am not quite sure what she means by a change of direction. If there was no need for a review, then I think that the Green Paper that we issued would have received far fewer than the 500 responses that came in. It would seem to indicate that a Green Paper that has over 500 responses indicates interest in a review which has taken place.</p>
      <p sl="en">In answer to the first question, I can’t submit an assessment to this Parliament until it has been undertaken. The Commission has not yet made its assessment; it has not yet decided on its response. It had a plenary discussion today and will make its views known when it submits its proposals to the Member States and, at the same time, they will be made known to Parliament, and that will be some time in the second half of November which is not very far away.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for politicisation – politicisation of these issues is almost inevitable. When you have European industry now representing different views and competing interests and, frankly, making very different rival submissions as to whether they want trade defence measures adopted, that is bound to be reflected in the positions of our Member States. If the Member States chose instead simply to take at face value the objective and rigorous analysis of the Commission’s services and to adopt the conclusions and the measures we propose; if they were prepared simply to do that, then the politicisation wouldn’t arise. However, the Member States are subject to the same lobbying and different competing interests, amongst producers, retailers, distributors, importers and consumers, as we are. When people have different views, those views have to be debated very broadly in a political way, through a political process, and that is what happens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I stand up and talk tonight because we are in a situation now where food security has become a real issue. For 25 years we have been in a situation where there has been plenty of food in Europe. In fact, we have been taking many decisions in agriculture, in the common agricultural policy, to restrict production in order to maintain prices and reduce the use of export subsidies and to export products on to the world markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we are facing a situation that is completely different: cereal prices have risen threefold this year; the livestock sector is having a huge problem, having seen its feed costs going up by perhaps 50% or 60%, and we are extremely concerned about this. Mr Daul, Mr Goepel and I have tabled this oral question – and we are delighted that Commissioner Fischer Boel is here tonight – because we feel we now have to look at every opportunity for getting extra feed into the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will have to face up to the reality that there are some feeds that are derived from GM maize and GM soya which cannot come into the European Union at the moment because they are not licensed. I think we have to make sure that we look at this and that we have a system by which we can license these products. Provided they are safe, they should come in to be fed to our poultry, and to our pigs in particular, as well as to our cattle, both beef and dairy, because we need to keep a very competitive industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to look at the situation regarding supermarkets, because – do not forget – not only are we concerned at the price that the farmer receives for his or her products, but we are also interested in what the consumer has to pay. There is no doubt that we are seeing, for instance, that only 10% of a loaf of bread is actually made from the raw material of wheat and yet there are huge increases in the price of the loaf because the supermarkets say they are having to pay so much more for wheat. So we need to put pressure on the supermarkets to make sure that consumers are paying the right price.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is great that it puts European agriculture in a very strong position to face up to the brave new world, because we will need food production, we will need farmers and we need the countryside, and all these things work very well.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, as I say, we now have to get the balance right between the cereal and livestock sectors, and that is why we have tabled this question. We shall be delighted to hear what Commissioner Fischer Boel has to say about it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, it is a pleasure to see you again here in Parliament. As you know, we were surprised a few months ago by a change in the situation in the market for some agricultural products, which not long ago we believed to be unthinkable; an enormous pressure on supply, with the consequences that we have been seeing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This in turn caused a major disturbance in the livestock production sector, foreseeable consequences in the rise of consumer prices and not forgetting the FAO’s warning about the consequences for foodstuffs in many areas of the world that could result from this situation. Let us not forget that while in Europe we spend 10-20% of household incomes on food, there are societies where this item accounts for 90% of income or more, and it is easy to imagine what a price rise would mean to these vast populations that are already so deprived.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore we need to act, and act immediately; and I am very pleased that the Commission has acted swiftly – and well – by taking some palliative measures, reducing the set-aside for 2008 to zero. It is a shame we did not go further. There are other measures that could perhaps be adopted without additional cost to the Community budget, such as advance authorisation of payments to certain livestock farmers of the aid they are entitled to, who are of course doubly affected not only by rising prices, but also by having to deal with livestock diseases, such as ‘bluetongue’, and so I think we could go a little further just now.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, most of all we must go further in assessing and studying the situation so that we can quickly identify the measures that, in the short term, can be adopted in the immediate future. We naturally place our trust in the sensitivity of the Commissioner and the Commission in following up this concern of ours.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, throughout Europe we are seeing across-the-board increases in the price of foodstuffs. Market surveys carried out show how European consumers are radically changing their eating habits, being forced to change the quality and type of products that they buy as a result of the exorbitant prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">These increases can be blamed on the one hand on the excessive number of intermediate phases that products must go through from the producer to the consumer, and on the other on the disproportionate increases applied by major supermarket chains. One thing is certain however: the blame for these increases cannot and must not be placed on our farmers, who are the main victims of this worrying situation.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President and Commissioner, we believe that today more than ever, the European agricultural model must be protected in order to shield national agricultural markets from international price fluctuations and give substance to the defence of models of production and use of the territory which are so characteristic of European agriculture. We welcome the Council’s recent decision to ratify the proposal for zero set-aside for 2008.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, this does not do enough to reassure us about the worrying situation in terms of cereal stocks and the rising price of cereals on the world market. We also need to work with the various CMOs and make good use of these mechanisms for rebalancing the market, which would help ease food prices, at least in the internal market. We asked the Commission, in a recent question, to propose an immediate increase in milk quotas of at least 2-3% to help stabilise the price of this staple product.</p>
      <p sl="it">In a difficult economic climate such as this one, the European Union and the Member States have a responsibility to help consumers maintain their food purchasing power while at the same time protecting our farmers’ right to an income.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I recall what I think is an old Japanese curse: ‘May you live in interesting times’, and I think this is exactly what we are doing now. We have seen, over the last six to eight months, prices for raw materials within the agricultural sector rocketing, as mentioned already by the speakers, but I have to say that this is happening from an historically low level. I think this is an important reminder to all of us. These increases in prices will be reflected on consumer prices but to a lower extent. If I may use the example of bread, a basic commodity – and I will use a German example – if you take the price of bread in a supermarket or in a store in Germany, only 4% of the price relates to the price of the cost of the wheat.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the dairy sector, as has been mentioned already, a number of different measures have already been foreseen. Milk quotas were increased on 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2007 by 0.5% in 11 Member States. On 1 April 2006, eight new Member States received this restructuring reserve varying from between 2% and 5% of their national quota level. On 1 April 2008 – next year – another 0.5% will be added to the increase in the quota allocated to 11 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, all market support aids have been massively reduced and, at the moment, there are no export refunds and no disposal aid at all – zero for both of them. The market outlook report in the dairy sector will be adopted by the Commission later this year and it will provide us with the basis for a further discussion on whether we need to increase again the quota. Moreover, I have already had the chance here to signal clearly the expiry of the milk quota system by 31 March 2015, and indicated as well that we needed, for the period from now until 2015, a soft landing for the abolition of the quota system. Among the possibilities mentioned is to increase the quota system over the period and we will have the possibility to discuss this during the health check next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the cereals sector there are various different reasons for the increase in prices. I shall just say, just to be sure that there are no misunderstandings, it is not biofuels that are causing the steep increase in prices. We use, today, less than 2% of cereal production for ethanol in Europe, but the reasons are different: adverse weather conditions in Australia, drought in southern Europe, floods in the northern part of Europe, increasing demand from India and China, and restricted exports out of Russia and Ukraine. Then, of course, there is the snowball effect from the very strong focus on ethanol in the United States and, therefore, a certain influence on the increase of prices in corn.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has, as mentioned already, reacted: set-aside is put to zero for the coming production year, for the sowing to take place this autumn and next spring. Then whether to continue a zero set-aside will be a discussion to be held during the health check. We expect that the zero set-aside could contribute to somewhere between 10 and 12-15 million tonnes, depending on the climatic conditions. Moreover, I will submit to the College of Commissioners a proposal to the Council to suspend cereal import duties only for the current market year. I think that those initiatives will help us to ease the pressure on the livestock farming and the consumer prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are different problems for the pigmeat sector. The pipelines are filled with meat, so there is an imbalance on the input and output in the sector and therefore the management committee decided last Thursday to introduce a private storage that I hope will help the problems in the pigmeat sector. There are other possibilities, but I think we should try to find the right balance because, if it is only a question of prolonging the pain, then we gain absolutely nothing.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, I think that we have reacted and I have had the possibility to thank Parliament for its quick reaction so that we could send clear signals as soon as possible to the farming sector on the zero set-aside. I would like to come back to the GMO question in my final remarks, as I can see that my time has expired.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would have been happy to share my time with the Commissioner, because I am interested to hear her views on GMOs, but I will be here for the entire debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it is true, because it is not the first time we have said it in this Chamber, that the unpalatable truth is that the era of relatively cheap food is over and that what has happened was not predicted either within the Commission or, indeed, globally.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commissioner has gone through some of the reasons why we now have this imbalance in supply and demand and I agree with her: weather, climate change, the demand from the developing countries and, yes, biofuels are impacting globally – the Commissioner has acknowledged that. However, it is important to remember – and there were others in this House prior to my time – what your predecessor Mr Fischler said when reforming the CAP in 2003. He promised farmers better market prices. Perhaps we are seeing the impact of those reforms now, and we are beginning to question those impacts because of the impact on consumer prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have had positive developments on milk and cereals, but we do not have the same on the livestock sector in terms of the beef and lamb producers, chicken and pigmeat that the Commissioner has discussed.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are asking the questions now about the volatility and whether we are happy with that volatility in demand and supply. A major food company said to me recently that the supermarket buyers have no knowledge or interest in the economics of food production, but they are beginning to take note, and that is positive. However, we need to monitor the power of the supermarkets and to look at whether they are passing on the price increases they are charging to the producers of food. That is something I would urge the Commission – perhaps the Commissioner for Competition – to take a close look at. They have refused to do it in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">Concerning GMOs, this is a big issue. There is a problem in relation to the differences of approval methods between the European Union and the US and we need to look at that. So I wait for the Commissioner’s comments on GMOs before making my points in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, we cannot ignore the impact on the developing world of insecurity, particularly with the grain market, where countries that cannot afford to pay more for food are seeing a massive increase in their food bill. We must acknowledge it in this House and we need to take it into account in our policies going forward.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during World Food Day on Tuesday 16 October, the FAO wanted to raise public awareness of malnutrition, which currently affects 854 million people throughout the world. On this occasion, the rising price of agricultural raw materials was highlighted, particularly its impact on consumers in the developing countries – my fellow Members have spoken about this at length – but also on the populations of poor countries, which import cereals. While in the developed countries, we spend 10 to 20% of our household budget on food, in the least developed countries, this figure is 60 to 80% of the budget, and a 20% increase in the price of cereals is drastic. This situation is made worse by the fact that some countries depend heavily on imports, and are affected by currency fluctuations, climate variations and increases in transport costs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, you have responded partially, but I hope there will be other measures. What measures do you intend to take in the short and medium term, for the CAP health check, to put right this difficult situation for consumers in the North, and this even more difficult situation for those in the South, and to contribute to a global food equilibrium?</p>

    <intervention id="2-347" speaker_id="4442" name="Niels Busk" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, it is important that there is now a focus on the very interesting situation that we are currently witnessing in connection with the very marked price increases for a number of agricultural raw materials. At the same time, we know that in the areas where they have not yet taken effect, namely the pig sector, these price increases will lead to a very expensive winter in terms of food prices. We are aware of the underlying causes: poor autumn yields, empty corn stores, etc. – I will not go into any more detail about this.</p>
      <p sl="da">I feel that the situation we are currently experiencing should provide an opportunity for more discussion. First and foremost, we should not be alarmed at the current price rises. For far too long a litre of milk has cost less than a litre of cola and less than a litre of water. It is completely unreasonable of us not to accept that food should cost what it actually ought to cost, because there is a long production time and many working hours behind the products, particularly in the milk sector. It is also clear that there is now an opportunity to increase the production of foodstuffs in Europe. The market is in fact demanding this of us. The Commission has shown good initiative by removing set-aside and of course we still have the opportunity to increase production very quickly, especially in the milk sector.</p>
      <p sl="da">We should continue the reform of the common agricultural policy from 2003 by reducing support, and we should seriously discuss further transfers of agricultural support to rural development policy. We now have the opportunity to kick-start dynamic agricultural production in the EU, and this means that we can give farmers more freedom than they have at present to exploit the current strong demand. Naturally, as is the tradition, we will also take care of farmers in mountainous areas and less fertile regions – that is all that is needed! However, we must not be afraid of price rises, but instead understand and make offensive use of the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, in the European Union we have recently seen a significant rise in the price of basic foodstuffs, particularly in the new Member States. In Poland, for example, the price of bread has risen by 15% over the last two years, the price of apples by 83% and the price of potatoes by 33%, while the price of milk has almost doubled. There is a similar trend in some of the old Member States: in Italy and in Ireland. Of the new Member States, Lithuania too has seen the price of cereals, milk, fruit and vegetables almost double.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, EU policy is based on limiting the amount of agricultural production, and this policy is beginning to appear increasingly at odds with the needs of consumers. All the so-called reforms of the common agricultural policy are based on limiting production within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Reform of the market in sugar is a massive limitation of sugar production in the European Union, from 18 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes. Reform of the market in wine again involves limiting production.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Other reforms also aim at producing less in the European Union. On the other hand, we have a very important signal. Consumers are demanding more food in Europe, and this is such a major signal that the entire aim of the common agricultural policy needs to be verified. We must ask ourselves whether the method of limiting production and setting production quotas is in fact good, above all from the point of view of the interests of consumers, as this is chiefly about them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is about Europe supplying as much food as its people require. There are many signals pointing to a need to review the agricultural policy we have been conducting. Many thanks.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, this discussion has gone crazy. We have been talking about falling prices, lowest possible prices and all-time lows for years. All the speakers who are now bemoaning the fact that prices are rising – finally heading upwards for once – and are calling for measures to hold back the price rises.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should be happy that the market is functioning, with your help. With the help of your predecessors, but also of demands made by the European Parliament, the billions of euros that were going into intervention and price stabilisation – the price pressure that ruined market prices on the world market and have caused the countries of the third world to get into difficulty – have been done away with. Finally this circumstance has been eliminated and we are getting closer to the market, entering a situation that is being exacerbated by the use of corn to produce fuels.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are many other reasons why such great demand exists on the market at present. The market reacts, the price goes up and now we, here in the European Parliament, as representatives of the farmers, are asking for prices to be brought down again. I have never been involved in anything so ridiculous in all my 20 to 25 years in Parliament! That is why I applauded Mr Busk. We should be delighted with this situation. Of course we have to be watchful on behalf of those who cannot afford to buy food at normal prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to hold unjust wage rates and misguided social policies in any country accountable, but we cannot take measures to put food in the mouths of the poor at the expense of farmers who, in recent years, have left farming in their hundreds of thousands. This is not the right way to be talking!</p>
      <p sl="de">I am glad that we can even discuss the situation here today and that we have a market in which prices are finally increasing.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is important to initiate this discussion, although, partly because of what the Commissioner has told us, we are not seeing the full scale of the problem yet.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to remind the Commissioner that a few months ago, we asked for a moratorium on the discussion of amendments to the CMO in fruit and vegetables in order to pause and reflect on what was happening – and what is happening now in wine – based on a few points, which I would now like to raise.</p>
      <p sl="it">Firstly: we are talking about harvests that have failed due to climatic events, but there is no mention of the fact that we will be dealing with this problem for years, because climate change is happening in Europe and around the world. Fact one!</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly: compared to 1950, when there were 2.5 billion of us and everyone on the planet had 0.5 hectares each, by 2020 the world’s population will have grown to 7.5 billion (according to UN data) with around 0.2 hectares per inhabitant available for cultivation.</p>
      <p sl="it">I understand where Mr Baringdorf is coming from when he says that this is a fundamental problem, but I do not think that the increases we are seeing at this time are to the advantage of producers. If we look at the difference between the cost of the product and what consumers are charged, we can see that consumers and producers are paying for a very long supply chain. However, this is partly due to policies created here in the European Parliament, so I think the Commissioner should look carefully at the actions we are going to be setting out.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, it has been important to return fallow land to production, although today what we need most of all is in-depth discussion. When the European Community was created, action was taken to meet the food requirements of the European people. Today, we should adopt the same policy. We can no longer allow land to be set aside under a decoupling policy, because this leads to a loss of production and renders our questions unproductive. Therefore, we must prepare for an in-depth discussion on whether the policies of the past few years have delivered a response to consumers and producers, or whether conversely they have created problems for both.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to focus on the position in the intensive sector. I will not take time to recount the dire straits in which many producers in that sector find themselves, rather I want to focus on what I believe the Commissioner should be doing to help. I have four or five points to make.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I think the Commissioner should recognise that soft measures, like market promotion, are not going to be enough. Secondly, she should face up, more than has happened to date, to the long-term impact on grain availability and prices of the rampant switch in the United States to biofuel production. Their targets, which are very aggressive, are in truth drying up the imports that we need in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, with intervention grain stocks at an alarming low and the ratio with usage being totally out of kilter, there urgently needs to be action to address that balance. Fourthly, I suggest that the Commissioner needs to be more proactive in fighting for speedier approval of GM substitutes. With respect, Commissioner, you need, on behalf of agriculture, to match the vigour of Commissioners Kyprianou and Dimas as they resist GM approvals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fifthly and finally, you need to put a floor in the market for our intensive sector, with export refunds extended immediately to meat and hams. On that point I am not sure that helping private storage will solve very much in the longer term.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me be first of all assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that I am happy to see prices going up for our farmers at last, so long as it is farmers who benefit, and not supermarket chains. Up until now the small number of supermarket chains that dominate the retail sector in Europe have been profiteering at the expense of our farmers and producers.</p>
      <p sl="en">In my constituency in Scotland, dairy producers have for far too long been getting GBP 0.17 per litre for milk, which is below the cost of production, while it was selling on supermarket shelves at over GBP 0.50 per litre. That has driven many dairy farmers in my constituency out of business altogether.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have now seen the price farmers receive for wheat go up by only 10 %, while the shelf price in supermarkets of wheat-based products has gone up by 40 %. Once again, supermarkets are using fluctuations in price to pocket bigger profits for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is a disgrace, and I agree entirely with Mr Parish that we should ask the Commission to start an investigation into the pricing policy of supermarket chains in order to ensure that consumers and producers get a fair deal.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, it is clear that the rise in prices that consumers are experiencing directly in their shopping baskets is due to multiple factors, but in my speech I am only going to discuss what Mr Stevenson said.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that the role of intermediaries and large food retail chains is concerning. In many cases they respond to speculative movements, so the increases in the prices of final products are greater, as has been said, in percentage terms, than the increases in the prices of raw materials.</p>
      <p sl="es">The situation is also very concerning for producers who, in the face of the huge purchasing power of the large retail sector, are obliged to reduce their selling prices, without being able to pass on the increases in raw material or fuel prices.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore think, and I support the previous speaker, that it is important for the Commission – and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for being here – to act and take measures: that there should be investigations and the necessary means put in place to bring an end to these practices, which are unfair, and in many cases abusive.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, many of those who have spoken before me have been pleased that there has been a rise in the price of foodstuffs, but we must ask ourselves whether this price is getting through to the farmer. I have very serious concerns about this. Many small farms are currently being closed down in line with the policy of the Commission and the European Union. We must, however, also ask ourselves what kind of foodstuffs farmers are receiving. They are getting beef from Brazil, sugar from South America, dodgy chickens from Asia, and thus cheap foods are pouring into our market, which is ‘lowering’ prices for us, but in fact restricting production in Europe. The question arises: are we going to have to keep on bowing down to the industrial lobby? Why, at the end of the day, can we not start supporting European farmers once again, at a time when a niche has appeared for us to increase this production and raise quotas for milk and starches, for example, for which there is a constant demand in Poland and other Eastern European countries.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the problem of bread, milk, potatoes and other foods undergoing a price hike, which in some Member States is ten times the current rate of inflation, is very acute, particularly for those on low incomes, the main proportion of whose budget goes on food.</p>
      <p sl="el">This problem did not come out of the blue. We know that the food sector is controlled by a few undertakings which make significant profits at the expense of producers and consumers: consumer prices are many times higher than those paid to the producers because of the large number of middlemen and the market monopoly. For this reason there is now an increased global demand for food and animal feed; cereals and oil seed rape are being used in the production of biofuels, not for environmental reasons but as part of the profit-making plans of the oil multinationals.</p>
      <p sl="el">There has been a collapse in prices and EU intervention to help cereal production has diminished, and there has also been a mandatory set-aside because of the CAP. All these factors, together, of course, with dreadful weather conditions, have drastically reduced the EU’s stocks and production. Nonetheless, trade and industry have exploited this at the expense of farmers and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is why food and animal feed prices have risen. These rises have worsened the position of workers, increased the number of undernourished people and bankrupted small and medium-sized livestock farmers. Greek livestock farmers are in despair; they are taking action to demand substantial aid to help them survive.</p>
      <p sl="el">The decision by the Council of Ministers on 26 September to remove the compulsory set-aside, suspend duties on imported cereals and take other measures, to which you have referred, Commissioner, will go some way towards easing the problem, but it does not solve it. The decision suggests half-measures, which are by their very nature insufficient. Substantial measures are required to boost and the stock of animal feed, control prices, and clamp down on cartels and speculation.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful that we can have this debate today with the Commissioner. As commodities prices increase, people are paying more attention to agriculture again. The situation is due, on the one hand – as already mentioned by the Commissioner and some of the previous speakers – to demand from third countries and on the other, to crop failures in traditional agricultural exporting countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Therefore it is essential that we mobilise all the resources that we have in Europe. I have now determined, for example during my visit to Romania, that at least a third of the total cultivatable land is lying idle, as it always has. We have considerable resources within our Member States. A first step would surely be to stop letting land lie fallow.</p>
      <p sl="de">As already stated, as a farmer, I believe wholeheartedly that the first priority should be to produce healthy food, the second priority to produce fodder and the third priority to produce energy materials. Ultimately, however, I believe that the slight price increase for our farmers does not in any way bring the price adjustment that would make up for the losses of recent decades. As many of those who have already spoken have pointed out, we are getting perhaps 10% more in primary materials prices, but retailers are marking that up by 40-50% in some instances. I am thinking of butter, for example, and this does not seem fair to me.</p>
      <p sl="de">One way for us farmers to respond would be to organise ourselves better into producer cooperatives with production contracts, in order to meet the food retailer monopolies head on.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The present debate clearly demonstrates yet again how widely opinions vary in this House. I agree with Mr Stevenson, namely that this price rise means only a very small increase in income for farmers, compared with the trade sector, supermarket chains, and market speculators, who take the lion’s share.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Another problem is that cereal producers will benefit hugely from this, while livestock producers will lose a great deal. We have an untenable situation here: certain sectors are either favoured or neglected under the common agricultural policy, and this price rise is set to make the neglected sectors even worse off, while those that are prosperous will get even richer.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that the increase in prices is a good thing, but who is going to be affected by this price increase? These contradictions are continually increasing, and unfortunately the distortions of the common agricultural policy deepen and exacerbate these distortions. We need to fundamentally rethink common agricultural policy, because piecemeal interventions are merely cosmetic. There can be no normal common agricultural policy as long as livestock production, wine, vegetables and fruit, pig-meat and poultry are neglected sectors. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as I said last month during the debate we had in Parliament on the suspension of compulsory set-aside, which was also a night sitting, the increase in agricultural prices should provoke an in-depth discussion on the direction that the common agricultural policy is taking.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will soon have the Communication from the European Commission on the CAP ‘health check’ on the table, but I fear that in that communication the Community executive will not be bold enough to acknowledge that the liberalisation of the markets also has a price, and that European farmers and consumers are now starting to pay that price.</p>
      <p sl="es">Many Members of this House have always favoured a dismantling of the market management measures and have contributed to projecting the negative image that European consumers have built up regarding the CAP.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I said at the last plenary sitting, I would like to know how we are now going to explain to citizens that we scarcely have the instruments to control these rises in agricultural prices in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">It would also be interesting to ask the European Commission to estimate what the cost is going to be for European citizens of this increase in food prices and to compare this cost with the cost for each citizen of the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also really like to know whether or not citizens will ultimately benefit in the coming years from the liberalisation of the markets and the drastic cuts in direct aid that European farmers are suffering from.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am going to give you a statistic which I think is very significant: before the creation of the CAP, in 1961, the prices of raw materials for producing animal feed were twice as high as the prices paid by farmers 20 years later. The common agricultural policy guaranteed a supply of raw materials at an affordable price and at the same time European consumers also benefited from a fair price for an essential commodity.</p>
      <p sl="es">In a country such as mine, Spain, we are seeing rises in prices of foods as basic as milk. I think that the economics and finance ministers of the European governments should now also be more concerned about the repercussions that this increase will have on inflation in their countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">As you are going to present your proposals on the CAP ‘health check’ to us in November, I would prefer to tell you now what I think, and say that I hope that in this ‘health check’ you will analyse whether the CAP is in line with the new requirements of the global market, because one of the principal causes of the restriction of European production has, I am convinced, been the lack of foresight by Community experts.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to review the current policy of extremely reduced stocks. The Community intervention stores should, as has been said here, be the safety net for guaranteeing supply at times like these, but there are no supplies and the Community stores are empty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a very timely debate. We all know that cereal prices have increased dramatically, and we know the reasons why. Commissioner, it is a fact that we depend on, and still need, grain imports and substitutes from outside the European Union, mostly from the United States. In this respect, I am concerned that it is taking so long to decide on the new strains of grain that are up for approval. I am well aware that this is not necessarily the Commission’s fault. It is the fault of the national governments, because they could not agree. You are going to have to take the decision, and I hope you take it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would urge speedier approval of the new strains of grain that are in the pipeline. As price inputs rise, the cost is inevitably passed on to the consumer. That is not something that anyone looks forward to, but it is where we must face up to the power of the supermarkets.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have known Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf for nearly 19 years now – ever since I have been in this Parliament. I have to say that sometimes he gets it right and sometimes he gets it wrong; he is wrong on this occasion. I am not against prices going up, as long as the price comes through to the producer as well as to the processor and the consumer.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must address not only this issue, but also the use of GM grain. We are importing into the European Union food for our consumers to purchase in our stores when we have no idea how it was produced. There is no traceability of these imports. They could have been produced using any manner of means. That is something that we must confront. A large amount of the meat coming from Brazil, to name but one country we have discussed, is almost certainly produced using GM-grain. How can we tell the difference?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the authors of this resolution and give them my support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The soaring price of cereals and therefore of foodstuffs generally reflects Europe’s current dependence on the volatility of world agricultural markets. Accepting this situation would mean accepting that consumers are becoming a variable for adjustment during the correction phases of these markets. Accepting this situation also means denying the influence of the large supermarkets, which for 40 years have contributed to the downward trend in prices for farmers, while food prices for consumers have stayed the same or have increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This excessive margin capture could have, and should have, been used by the large supermarkets to absorb the rising cost of agricultural raw materials in the crisis we are currently experiencing. Clearly this is not happening. The large supermarkets are continuing to abuse their dominant position and the Commission must now discuss this question as a matter of urgency so as to prevent European consumers from being held hostage to an unfair and dangerous system.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will try to respond to some of the questions raised.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I agree with those who say that it is nice and very satisfactory to see that the market is now working, that the reforms we have been making are working. That was the whole idea behind all the work done to reform our agricultural sector, so now the farmers can actually respond to the market, and that – from the farmer point of view – is what we really want to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to realise that this increase in prices is not a European phenomenon, it is a global phenomenon – and that is the reason why it is very difficult for us to take certain measures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just like to respond to the idea of introducing export refunds. I think it could send the wrong signal to the sector to continue production and thereby prolong the pain to the point where we see an increase in prices – here I am talking specifically about the pigmeat sector. But there will be pressure on prices as long as we have overproduction compared to demand. We see that prices are going down on carcases; we know that it is part of the cycle and we know as well that in autumn there is always pressure on pigmeat prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me just mention biofuels, which, under the mandatory targets that the Commission presented on 10 January 2007, will represent 10% of our fuel transport sector by 2020. We never intended that this would be exclusively European production: we will need imports. However, it is very important that we start on the first generation and thereby encourage our research institutions to try to find the golden solution for the second generation that will not be produced exclusively or mainly on cereals but on straw, woodchips and residues from slaughterhouses. We therefore have potential, and we estimate that, by 2020, between 20% and 30% will be coming from the second generation, and we might be able to do better if we push the research investments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning GMOs, I can fully assure you that the Commission is aware of the problem posed by asynchronous authorisation. You can see the consequences in the Directorate General for Agriculture’s recently published report – which you can find on the internet – where there are three different scenarios. The Commission is currently reflecting on the best way to address this situation without any compromise on our high level of risk assessment, with regard to both the environment and human health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important improvements have already been made in reducing the procedure or the time line – the time necessary – for authorising GMOs. I would like to mention, just as an example, the recent commitment by the European Food Safety Authority to perform the completeness check within six weeks, compared with a much longer period previously. I also expect that stronger support from the Member States will help the Commission in further shortening the time line of the authorising process. Steps in this direction have been taken to increase Member States’ support in the authorising process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am strongly committed to workable implementation of our rules to ensure that trade in animal feed is not disrupted, with clearly negative consequences for our farmers. But I am also committed to ensuring the highest level of safety when it comes to placing new GM products on the market, and of course our trading partners know the specific rules that we have within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just two days ago I came back from Argentina and Brazil. They told me clearly that they will be able to deliver non-GM products, soybean and maize mainly, and the types of GM products that have been authorised in Europe. But they said that we have to be aware that this is more costly. If we are prepared to pay the price they will deliver but we have to remember that they have other customers out there, and here they mentioned China as a big customer.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I am quite sure that we will come back to this issue. I feel certain that we will before too long.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report [2007/2105(INI) ] (A6-0336/2007) by Mr Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Green Paper ‘Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level’.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-366" speaker_id="1038" name="Karl-Heinz Florenz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that the European Union is again discussing tobacco consumption. In my country alone, 350 people die every day as a result of tobacco consumption so it is only right that we deal with this topic at European level. I am very glad that the committee decided to launch a European initiative to continue to promote a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and public buildings. I think this is the right approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">Whether there needs to be European legislation or national legislation that would then perhaps be established within the European framework is a matter for debate. Those who still believe that we do not need it should bear in mind that, in relation to the Air Quality Framework Directive that we passed here a few weeks ago, we argued about whether we would accept 20 or 25 ppm of fine particulate in the air. Commissioner, the figure in the average pub is 540 grams and after midnight at the ‘Aviateur’, a popular pub in this area, it is 1 730 grams, so you see how great the differences are and how necessary this is.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another very important point, which has concerned me for many years, is additives. Even now, 600 additives may be included in cigarettes, and 70-80 of these are on the ‘red list’. These are highly toxic, carcinogenic substances which may damage our young people's fertility and trap them in addiction. These substances require very critical, intense scrutiny, the cost of which must, of course, be borne by the manufacturers. The thought of Commissioner Kyprianou having to spend his last penny on tests made necessary by that industry is deplorable. The question of costs must therefore be settled, by placing it firmly with the Commission. I believe that this will reveal many of the main pathogenic ingredients of cigarettes. Nevertheless, cigarettes are still dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="de">For me, a further important point is the question of whether, in the long term, we can get industry to pay some of the expenditure brought about by tobacco. As far as I can see, we have introduced producer liability in many areas: if you drive your car into a ditch and this was due to some defect in the car, the manufacturer of the car must pay.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I would like to see you make every effort to initiate this redistribution of costs onto the manufacturers of tobacco products because, when you think about it, my country spends EUR 50 billion getting people back on their feet. Why should somebody who has never held a cigarette in their hand have to be involved in that? That is very unfair, and I would be glad to see those on this side of the Chamber who have a social conscience working hard on this issue. The costs should be transferred to where they belong – those responsible for them, the producers. Of course, they will pass the cost on afterwards. I understand that; that is the way of things in a social market economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Every year, thousands of people in Europe die because of smoking. We must therefore put proper, strict rules in place.</p>

    <intervention id="2-367" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Markos Kyprianou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to begin by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur, Mr Florenz. I think he, and other colleagues here, remember from the very first day of my hearing in the European Parliament, which he chaired by the way, that I have made a very firm commitment: I would like to see Europe free of tobacco.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that, slowly and gradually, we are getting there. I would like to thank Mr Florenz for the work and his dedication and the commitment he has to this cause. Also, on a personal note, Mr President, if you will allow me, I would like to wish Mr Florenz a happy birthday. I understand that yesterday was his birthday. I will not mention the age as I do not want to create an interinstitutional problem, but I would like to wish him many happy returns.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say that we see a trend and significant improvement in the area of smoke-free environments in the European Union, as compared to a situation three years ago where we only had Ireland and, I think, Italy which had just introduced these bans. Now we have a much larger number of states that have adopted these more comprehensive bans, even some with a few exceptions: I shall come to that in a minute. But I believe that we need a joint effort to achieve this – the Commission, Member States and, most importantly, the European Parliament. I shall say that Parliament’s contribution to the Tobacco Directive was of vital importance and I would like to interpret today’s report as support for smoke-free environment policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also very happy that the report takes a very positive constructive approach to the Commission’s Green Paper, in particular on supporting the Commission’s view that only a full smoking ban can adequately protect the health of citizens and workers. We have to be frank about that. First of all, a comprehensive smoking ban protects from passive smoking, it is a disincentive for people, especially young people, to begin smoking, it is an incentive for many people to quit. It creates, and this is an important factor, a level playing field among the various operators, especially in the entertainment industry, because the exceptions, in order to be effective, have to provide for separate rooms, sealed, negative pressure, separate ventilation systems – all this creates a certain cost that not all operators can meet. It does create a better level playing field and, also, it is easier to enforce when there are no exceptions. We have evidence from the European Union, but also from other jurisdictions which have introduced these bans before us, that there has been no negative effect on the hospitality sector. Actually, in many cases the revenues went up.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, for me, what is important is a result. That is what we are trying to achieve. The procedure through which we achieve it is not very important for me, whether it is European legislation, national legislation or regional legislation in some cases, what we need to do is achieve the target. I am ready, and I would be willing to accept a step-by-step approach, provided that at the end the target, and not far away, should be an introduction of a comprehensive ban.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where are we today? I would like to mention that. We already have total bans in Ireland and the United Kingdom – the whole of the United Kingdom. We have Sweden, Italy, Malta, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland which have already introduced quite thorough smoking bans even with exceptions on the special sealed-off rooms as I said earlier, with separate ventilation systems. France followed this two-step approach, so as of next year will have a similar situation. Then we have the same restrictions, but with more exceptions, when it comes to hospitality venues for countries like Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands. We have also proceeded in countries like Germany and Austria, where initiatives are under way already to strengthen existing smoke-free regulations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have had a Green Paper as you know. We had a consultation, a debate in the Council and now with the contribution from the European Parliament I am planning to take all these and then decide what will be the next step at European level and what action should be taken. We also have commitments under the international obligation of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control – all these will be brought together to decide what the next steps should be.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will go to another point which is included in the report, the Tobacco Products Directive, and I think that is a very important issue. We will produce a second report on the implementation of this Directive later this year and it will analyse the state of implementation of the directive and identify areas that warrant future amendments. It will discuss and will be inspired by the report. Several issues which feature in today’s report will be included in ours, for example those on the regulation of tobacco ingredients, labelling requirements for tobacco products and products and manufacturers’ liability.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to mention two points. One is the issue of the pictorial warnings. As you know, we have created a databank with different photographs and pictures that can be used as pictorial warnings, but I have to admit that it is very disappointing that very few Member States have actually taken advantage of that. I really regret that. To give you an example, I am just going through my notes, we have now only Belgium which has introduced them. Romania will do it from next year and then we have the United Kingdom also later next year. I have commitments from the Finnish and Latvian governments that they plan to introduce these in the near future and that was after many calls and urging Member States to introduce them.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have many countries outside the European Union, like Switzerland and New Zealand, which signed licence agreements with us so that they can use our pictures and our suggestions so, for me, the situation in the European Union is very disappointing and therefore we are very seriously contemplating actually amending the relevant directive and creating a mandatory obligation to use the pictorial warnings. I also find very interesting the Parliament proposal to have these on both sides of the package. This is something that we will study.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the application of the implementation of the tobacco advertising ban is now everywhere. We had problems with certain Member States. We managed to sort them out, some through legal actions, others through persuasion, but now that applies equally everywhere. One specific aspect I would like to mention is the initiative we took recently to convince non-EU countries to stop allowing the sponsorship of Formula One events by the tobacco industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, we do not have the legal extraterritorial jurisdiction; on the other hand, as these events are broadcast back to Europe they are viewed by the European citizens, they affect young people in Europe, they undermine European legislation and European policies in this area, so I have contacted both those from the private sector involved in this and the respective countries which still allow – there are only three – tobacco sponsorship and host Formula One events. Hopefully soon we may have some positive results but I will pursue this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur, but also the Members of Parliament who are very committed in this effort. For me, and I have said that from the very first day, it is very frustrating that, in the European Union, with the highest levels of education and standards of living, people still die of preventable diseases. More than 600 000 people die of tobacco-related diseases. I believe that this is a lifestyle where we can encourage change.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, exactly 20 years ago, as a legal adviser in the office of the Belgian Secretary of State for Health, I had the opportunity to draw up regulations that led to the first national Decree banning smoking in public places in the then European Community.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, I have the feeling that, with the resolution on which we are voting tomorrow, we are now playing a kind of pioneering role here, too, in this field. The initiative in the Green Paper and the excellent report by Mr Florenz have without doubt shown us the way. Anyone reading the resolution can come to only one conclusion: the European Parliament is opting henceforth for a zero-tolerance policy on smoking.</p>
      <p sl="nl">An immediate ban on harmful additives is demanded, as is the effective application of product liability in respect of tobacco manufacturers – these are examples of sections that speak for themselves. An unrestricted smoking ban in public places, transport, enclosed workplaces – including catering and drinking establishments – is also called for here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this regard, however, my group believes that account must be taken of the decisions taken recently in a number of Member States calling for a high level of investment – which has not yet been written off – in a number of sectors. Account has to be taken of these, but our ultimate objective in the longer term – to be pursued consciously and without hesitation – must be an unrestricted smoking ban, covering these places too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The wind is fully in our sails on this issue. If Eurobarometer and other surveys are to be believed, we have the full support of the people. To anyone who still doubts the need for intervention, I should like to point out that, since we arrived here in Strasbourg on Monday afternoon, statistically some 480 Europeans will have died from the effects of passive smoking.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, we have to take action against this. My group, too, intends to invest the maximum effort in this, and also to support all the supporting anti-smoking campaigns.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the International Agency for Research on Cancer recently examined all available evidence on second-hand smoke and cancer. This was an independent panel of international scientists from 12 countries convened by the World Health Organisation. They concluded that second-hand smoke is carcinogenic and that exposure to other people’s smoke increases the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers by 25-30% – quite a staggering figure.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that people in the workplace and in enclosed public places have the right to be protected from other people’s smoke. Remember that the majority of the population are non-smokers. The best way to deal with this problem is by a comprehensive smoke-free regulation at Member State level, encompassing a ban in all enclosed public places and in workplaces.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not, therefore, agree with Amendment 3 by Mr Florenz asking for limited exceptions. Any exceptions must be kept to a minimum.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nor do I agree with his Amendment 2, which deletes a proposal for amending the Framework Directive on workplace safety and health, requiring all employers to ensure a smoke-free workplace. Employers have a responsibility to protect workers’ health. Further, I would resist any suggestion that exemptions should be granted to pubs or bars not serving food. Not only is this harmful to employees, but it would also lead to health inequalities. For example, in the UK, non-food pubs accounted for half of all pubs in deprived areas, compared with a quarter in more affluent areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think that awareness-raising measures about the dangers of smoking are crucial. Bigger and bolder picture warnings are part of this awareness-raising and, therefore, I cannot support Amendment 6, which deletes paragraph 16, which refers to these pictures.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we would all agree that we must act to help prevent young people from smoking. The younger people are when they start smoking, the more difficult it is to stop in later life. Therefore, I would urge support for paragraph 4 of the report, which is aimed at cutting the number of young smokers by 50% by 2025 and rejection of Amendment 1 by Mr Florenz calling for the deletion of this paragraph.</p>
      <p sl="en">Smoking causes enormous health problems within the population, both of smokers and non-smokers, and I know that some colleagues feel that the use of snus is a better alternative. However, I cannot support measures that may lead to the wider use of snus, because its use has its own health-related problems, including oral cancer. There is no value in trading one health hazard for another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, if we are serious about improving the health of our citizens, then we must encourage all Member States to introduce the necessary measures to make a smoke-free Europe a reality. Can I just suggest that we could make a great start by enforcing the ban here in our own Parliament buildings?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the timing of the Commission Green Paper and the report by Mr Florenz is excellent. It is really high time the European Union returned to the issue of tobacco, as silence has surrounded the subject for too long.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Florenz report rightly focuses on smoking among young people and the harmful effects of passive smoking in workplaces, public buildings and catering and drinking establishments. On the subject of young people, research has shown that 90% of smokers start smoking as children, as under 18s. I am very pleased with the ambitious objectives of the Florenz report to significantly reduce smoking among this age group. After all, young people are susceptible to peer pressure and, in addition, the harmful effects on health are greater in this group.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is my hope, therefore, that the Member States – who think, of course, that they themselves can do everything best and that we must on no account become too involved – will respond to this House’s appeal to commit themselves to halving the harmful effects of smoking among young people by 2025, so that they actually take action by agreeing with each other to do so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to passive smoking and the general smoking ban, a sound liberal principle is that one’s personal freedom ends where another’s begins – and what clearer illustration of this principle can there be than unwilling passive smoking? Passive smoking inflicts great harm on public health and entails costs for the European economy. Each year more than 79 000 adults die in the EU Member States as a result of passive smoking, and there is proof that passive smoking in the workplace accounted for 7 000 deaths in the European Union in 2002, whilst exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke at home was responsible for a further 72 000 deaths.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Of course, ample experience of this kind of smoking ban has been gained already in countries such as Ireland, Scotland and Italy, and this experience is actually all positive. The comments from these countries – including from people who had been very sceptical about this kind of measure – are ultimately positive. Thus, it is tempting to issue a smoking ban at European level, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Recently, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, this House decided against imposing a European smoking ban at this time, instead opting to leave such measures to Member States. I think this is the right decision, as such a controversial decision should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen for the time being – that is, at Member State or regional level. Therefore, the call on the part of those Member States who already have a smoking ban for the voluntary signing of a European charter in order to bring greater clarity for consumers strikes me as the most that can be achieved at present.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is extremely good – and in this respect I commend the Commissioner on his Green Paper – is the promotion of this discussion that has indisputably taken place. The issue is on the agenda in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to make some concluding remarks about the Directive on tobacco products. The Florenz report also looks towards the revision of this Directive. I support everything the report says about picture warnings on cigarette packets. It is tragic that so few Member States have made use of these, and personally I would be in favour of legislating in this regard. Moreover, it should be possible to use these warnings in other ways, too, for example on the kind of information leaflets on how to stop smoking that they have in Canada; the experience with this has been positive, and it also strikes me as an excellent idea.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to wish you a happy birthday, Mr Florenz, albeit belatedly.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know that smoking kills. Every year, it causes the deaths of 650 000 people, and a further 79 000 adults die as a result of passive smoking. We are delighted with the energy and commitment that the Commission has shown on this and are pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has made clear, firm proposals. We also have the majority of citizens behind us. Almost 70% of them do not smoke, most smokers want to quit and Eurobarometer has clearly shown that 86% of those surveyed want a ban on smoking in the workplace, while 84% are for a ban on smoking indoors and 77% want no smoking at all in restaurants.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are therefore very concerned about the amendments introduced by the rapporteur, because Amendment 3 would signify a definite dilution of this strong report by our committee. It basically means a ban with exceptions, and we all know what happens with exceptions – they quickly become the rule. Take Germany, for example, where we have seen that progress has been made thanks to stipulations made by Brussels and the debate at European level. It would be fatal for the EU to cease championing this cause of behalf of consumers in the area of health protection and if we failed to see it through.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I hope that we reject Amendment 3 tomorrow and that we stand up for robust European health protection so that we can finally achieve a smoke-free zone throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Thank you. 650 000 people die each year from smoking and 80 000 people die each year from passive smoking in the EU alone. These gloomy statistics show us clearly that we must do everything we can to combat smoking. Karl-Heinz Florenz has put forward a number of good proposals for action, such as tightening up existing legislation, deterrent notices on cigarette packaging, measures to prevent young people from starting smoking, measures to help smokers who want to be free from their dependence and, in general, measures to support the Member States in combating smoking. That is a good thing. However, I am opposed to transferring more power to the EU in the field of public health, particularly when the Member States are already doing a good job.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The smoking ban in pubs is a good example. At least ten EU countries now have some form of smoking ban in restaurants and pubs. It started with Ireland in 2004 and quickly spread to Sweden, Italy, Finland, Malta, Belgium and so forth. Many more are on the way. Should we now stop this process of setting good examples and wait for EU central legislation? No, I don’t think so, but let the good examples continue to be disseminated. I note that in his report Mr Florenz writes that he wants to call on all the Member States to introduce an unrestricted smoking ban. That is good, as I interpret it as meaning that we do not need to take a roundabout route via the European Commission and still run the risk that it will be thrown out by lobbyists from the tobacco industry.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In conclusion, is there not a danger, after all, of giving with one hand and taking away with the other? We are urging people to stop smoking while at the same time the EU continues to subsidise tobacco cultivation to the tune of more than EUR 1 billion every year. EUR 1 000 million every year. These subsidies obviously must be abolished. As soon as possible!</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to repeat things – four minutes of speaking time are too precious – except to say that, like most speakers, I welcome the broad lines of this motion for a resolution. Information programmes and preventive measures to reduce the number of young smokers in the coming years are only to be welcomed. This goes for deaths caused by tobacco, and in other areas it also goes for road deaths and deaths caused by alcohol. Up to this point I join the consensus. At the same time, however, we must remain reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Just as we do not stop traffic because of the fatal accidents or toxic exhaust emissions, or banish wine and beer to purgatory because of the cirrhosis of the liver suffered by some politicians, on tobacco, too, we must let common sense prevail, and avoid hypocrisy at all costs.

      <p sl="nl">In principle, it must continue to apply that no supranational regulation is needed in this area. Europe should respect the principle of subsidiarity once and for all if it wants reconciliation with its citizens. To give an example, years ago, a European directive laid down that tobacco, too, had to be labelled – which is all well and good, but then bureaucracy suddenly reared its head. The label has to cover 30% of the packet; 35% if it is bilingual. The text must be in black lettering, with a black border of minimum 3 mm and maximum 4 mm thickness, the font must be Helvetica, and so on and so forth. Europe wants to dictate everything, and no one understands where the subsequent irritation of the general public comes from.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, there is the hypocrisy of the subsidies for tobacco farmers, which even as recently as last year amounted to EUR 900 million a year. This has now been reduced to EUR 300 million, but is still many times greater than the sum channelled into information to induce young people to stop smoking. There is also a parallel with our nation-states: in Brussels a pack of cigarettes now costs EUR 4.30, of which EUR 3.30 goes as excise duty to the Belgian State, which spends a few million on anti-tobacco information programmes. Billions of euros a year in excise duties could serve to finance the health costs of combating lung cancer. Forgive my cynicism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What are we going to do, though? Abolish the subsidies and disadvantage our European farmers by importing tobacco products from abroad? These questions, too, must be answered if one is to lapse into grandiloquent lyricism; otherwise, one pulls the wool over citizens’ eyes. Unfortunately, I can find no answer to these questions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, let us also avoid overdoing it, ladies and gentlemen, as the didactic language used sometimes makes me feel rather queasy. In fact, it all makes me shudder. A smoke-free Europe. What fine words. What puritanism. Sinners are to be punished. Let us guard against excessive stigmatisation of the 30% of the population who smoke. Let us refrain from becoming anti-tobacco ayatollahs, as a Socialist Minister in France once implored me. Let us refrain from lapsing into American conditions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In California there are some who want to ban smoking in people’s own homes, too, from 2009. Just imagine! How are they going to do that? With commandos and informers? Compulsory tobacco detectors in every home? Is this the example we wish to follow? Are we going to follow in their footsteps? Are we going to ban the reading of Simenon on grounds that Inspector Maigret with his pipe is a bad example to young people?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Let us remain reasonable. In many European countries – for example Italy, France, the Scandinavian countries and also my own country – smoking was banished from the shop floor and from restaurants long ago; and a good thing, too. They did not need Europe for this. Long live freedom, I say. Let us give those restaurant managers who want one a small room for customers who occasionally like to enjoy a good cigar after their coffee or pousse-café. Who knows, though – perhaps coffee will also be banned and banished in tomorrow’s Europe, as caffeine, too, is addictive. Perhaps it would be best if the Commission put people on bread and water.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, in addition to smokers who are at risk from the dangers of smoking there are the millions of Europeans on the sidelines. The creation of a Europe free from tobacco smoke and the prevention of passive smoking are two of the crucial tasks of the Union’s environmental and public health policy. Member States have also committed themselves to this goal through international law, as, with the exception of Italy and the Czech Republic, all the Member States of the Union have recognised the protection of citizens from tobacco smoke in the WHO Framework Convention as a fundamental right. This right must be effectively protected.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Of the choices presented by the Commission, adherence to the status quo is not a viable option. Voluntary arrangements have not succeeded in protecting people from tobacco smoke. I too would like to thank the rapporteur for advocating binding legal remedies as the most effective way of combating this problem.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We have to protect two groups in particular: children and young people, and employees. We cannot, however, adopt just any rules. We have to stay within the limits of rationality, as befits the powers we have under the EU. Supporting a sales ban on tobacco products to under-18-year-olds applied within the entire EU area is quite a different matter from restricting smoking in private vehicles in the presence of minors. In such a case I would appeal rather to the parents’ conscience and discretion. Do not force your child to breathe in deadly air. Legislators should be careful about aiming at compliance with laws which it is virtually impossible to monitor.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There is also a need to highlight the importance of preventive work and various campaigns. To protect workers, though, it is absolutely essential that a comprehensive smoking ban be brought in in all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I also wish to raise the matter of the manufacturer’s responsibility. The Tobacco Products Directive should be amended to include the manufacturer’s liability when healthcare costs are being financed as a result of tobacco consumption. Smoking is not just something that concerns smokers, because the hundreds of billions of euros in costs which are incurred by society as a result of tobacco consumption have to be paid by the majority who do not smoke. Making people feel guilty helps no one and is, moreover, a poor policy, but the facts have to be stated. Smoking costs too much; it costs lives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as has already been mentioned, every year 65 000 people die in Europe from smoking-related illnesses. The number of victims of passive smoking is also tragically high – about 80 000 European citizens die every year owing to other people’s bad habit. That is why a total ban on smoking in the workplace and other public places should be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our long fight against smoking has not been unsuccessful. Ten or twenty years ago, it was natural for people to smoke almost everywhere: during meetings and even on buses in some countries. Now it is almost an aggression to light a cigarette at social events. The success of the anti-smoking campaign shows us that multinational companies, such as the tobacco companies, are not unbeatable. If we have clear goals for the environment and health and we can mobilise society, NGOs and politicians – not forgetting good lawyers – then we can reach our goals, step by step. This report is taking the right steps in the right direction. We should of course mention that it is smoking we are fighting, not smokers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this motion for a resolution is balanced, precise and comprehensive, and the rapporteur, Mr Florenz, deserves our honest congratulations on his work.</p>
      <p sl="en">My only criticism of this resolution is that it has come too late. The supporting scientific evidence and the undisputed need for the policy options contained in this document have been clear for all to see for many years. It is sadly certain that the delay in making significant progress towards achieving a Europe free from tobacco smoke will have brought about the deaths from a preventable cause of hundreds of thousands of EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Who is to be blamed for this massive sacrifice of human life? I will mention only two of the main guilty parties so as to shame them, even though not in a sufficiently drastic fashion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the tobacco industry. It has spent millions of euros on campaigns of lies and misinformation. It has manipulated the media, politicians and even scientists in order to buy more time, and this it has done purely and simply for financial gain, knowing full well that thousands of lives were at stake.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the governments and some political parties of many EU Member States. They have bowed to the power and influence of the tobacco barons and have continued to hold back on taking effective measures to protect their citizens against the plague of smoking. Even straightforward measures, such as increasing tobacco taxation and making free treatment of tobacco addicts widely available, have been suppressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and I urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco-related diseases of so many lives.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Karl-Heinz, congratulations on your 60th birthday. I am pleased to see that you are just as full of life as the young Karl-Heinz. The best present that the PPE-DE Group could give Karl-Heinz would be to let him withdraw the weaknesses in his own report that he has presented. I think it is important to mention additives in the report. We have been asking for legislation for a long time. Harmful additives must go, and it is a disgrace that the information is so poor. We therefore now expect a rapid proposal from the Commission to get rid of these terrible additives that make cigarettes even worse.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We all have a natural right to avoid smoke in our workplaces, just as children have a natural right to avoid smoke in their playgrounds. Parliament is perfectly right to call on the Member States to address this problem. If you take children to our own stairwell outside the restaurant here, they smell of smoke for half an hour afterwards. I also want to mention one aspect that has come out of the debate. Any credible tobacco policy must include the phasing out of all subsidies, and we must ensure that our companies do not undermine the work through heavy marketing in developing countries.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as the statistics show, approximately 30% of the population continues to reach for a cigarette on a daily basis. I agree unconditionally that non-smokers should be protected from the harmful consequences of inhaling nicotine smoke. I cannot, however, agree with the Jacobinical methods proposed in the resolution. We cannot create a repressive policy for smokers that involves the restriction of their civil liberties.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I believe we should place the emphasis on broad public education and regulate the sales price by raising taxes, as scientific studies have shown this to be an effective weapon in the fight against tobacco addiction. The point proposing a ban on smoking at work is incontrovertible. I do think, though, that it should be expanded by adding a rider guaranteeing that each entity must provide smokers with a place nearby where they may smoke without harming others. In the current climate this space must not be merely an artificial and pointless manifestation of health promotion; it must be an effective action.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the time available to me I would like to touch on another problem, which has its origins in the anti-nicotine policy pursued by a number of governments, namely the rise in smuggling of counterfeit tobacco products, their main attraction being that they are cheaper than the original product. This is currently one of the most lucrative sources of income for smugglers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Please bear in mind that these products are sold in our shops, to our citizens. Those who have taken up selling this product will not hesitate to sell to someone under age. When drawing up an anti-nicotine policy, therefore, we must examine the problem from a number of angles to ensure that the legal reality we establish provides effective help in solving the problems linked to the use of nicotine products.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to our rapporteur. My primary concern is the protection of workers. I join with all Members who want the Member States to respond quickly, and that is what we are doing with this resolution. Results to date show that it has worked in some Member States but not in my own.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to the protection of workers, the question is, 'what steps can the European Commission take to prevent the creation of first- and second-class citizens?' How have the Member States reacted to this discussion so far? Are they for pushing ahead with worker protection at European level and for taking actions and measures such as a ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars? Most of us approach this topic based on our situation and we often forget that we should be thinking about the workers who have to work under these conditions.</p>

    <intervention id="2-381" speaker_id="28247" name="Holger Krahmer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only with regard to protecting non-smokers, but also in other matters, I believe we should not take the EU’s powers to extremes. What are we really talking about here? Surely the point is to initiate discussion about a potentially smoke-free Europe, not to wage a crusade against people who consume a product that is legal in Europe. However, some of the contributions to this discussion, and many of the amendments, sound more like a religious war than the debate that I feel would be appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the same way, the report stated that this policy should create an environment in which smoking was no longer seen as normal. I do not believe that it is the task of politicians to teach people how to behave or to dictate to people what they should think. We should keep things in perspective when it comes to the question of what the EU should regulate and what it should not.</p>
      <p sl="de">Regulations structuring the tax systems of individual Member States are not part of our competence, nor are wide-ranging bans on smoking. Put simply, the Member States have not given us that authority. Even though there is a trend towards non-smoking in Europe, to exploit this trend to adopt excessive rules and to ride the wave of public approval is bad form, in my opinion. We are talking here almost exclusively of bans. Bans usually only increase the attraction of whatever has been forbidden, especially for young people, the group that we are particularly concerned about.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, we should focus our energy and money on educating people about the harmful consequences of tobacco consumption, targeting each group as individually as possible. That is the only way to get people to make wise decisions in the long term.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-382" speaker_id="28227" name="Anja Weisgerber" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics on the consequences of smoking speak for themselves. Mr Florenz is right not to tire of pointing out that 650 000 deaths due to active smoking and 80 000 deaths due to passive smoking cost our health system EUR 50 million every year. There should be no need for us Parliamentarians to discuss effective protection for non-smokers. Therefore, the discussion is not about ‘whether’, but ‘how’ it can be effected.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are several different models of effective protection for non-smokers in Europe. Some countries, such as Sweden and Ireland, have imposed a strict ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and pubs, and in public buildings; others have provided for narrow exemptions. We should respect these different models. In principle, therefore, I think that protection of non-smokers is a matter for the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rapporteur proposes that Europe should intervene in the event that Member States fail to provide effective protection of non-smokers in the workplace. However, where these rules are infringed, I favour the EU keeping to the framework of EU powers regarding occupational safety and health.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also advocate recognition of the existing rules in the Member States. Functioning, existing national rules in the area of protection of non-smokers must be able to be retained. Member States that are well along the way should be rewarded; we need to recognise the effort they have made. We should take national differences and regional distinctiveness into account on a case by case basis, and accept them.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this must still ensure sufficient special protection for children and young people, and for non-smokers. We do not want to water down the protection of non-smokers. This will achieve a high level of health protection while adhering to the principle of subsidiarity and respecting the interests and regional differences of Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Florenz’s report. I strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was delighted when Scotland led the UK in introducing a smoking ban in March 2006, and I am pleased that bans are now in place in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a Scottish ban has now been in place for some time, we have evidence on what kind of health impact it has had. Recent figures from Scotland show that, since the smoking ban was introduced, there has been a 20% reduction in heart attack admissions to hospital.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also continue to raise awareness of the health risks associated with smoking. For this reason, on 14 November 2007, I am launching a written declaration in the European Parliament calling for more research and resources for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a common and costly lung disease whose advanced stage is chronic respiratory failure. It is an under-recognised, under-diagnosed and under-treated disease, neglected by health care providers and the public. The rise of COPD makes it all the more important that the EU adopts comprehensive smoke-free policies and Mr Florenz’s report.</p>

    <intervention id="2-384" speaker_id="28126" name="Christofer Fjellner" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="sv">Thank you very much. I would like to begin by saying that I am essentially sceptical about the idea of the EU banning smoking in public places throughout the Union. Even those who are in favour of this kind of smoking ban must see the problem of us doing it at EU level. After all, decisions like this are controversial. If the citizens find out that they come from Brussels, that someone who is not directly concerned is introducing these decisions, I think that opposition will increase.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, there are things that we can do here in the EU to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoke throughout Europe. For example, we can abolish the EU’s incomprehensible ban on Swedish snuff. I am coming back with the obstinacy of a fool to take the opportunity to highlight the Swedish experience. We have the lowest proportion of smokers anywhere in Europe, we have the lowest proportion of all tobacco-related illnesses anywhere in Europe, but do you know what? Despite this we have roughly the same tobacco consumption as the rest of Europe, but we use snuff rather than cigarettes. The fact is that if the rest of Europe replaced cigarettes with snuff to the same extent that we have done in Sweden, 200 000 Europeans would be spared lung cancer every year. I therefore think that it is immoral to keep our eyes closed.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Unfortunately the Commission’s reasoning seems to be precisely the opposite. Today the Commission ordered the Åland Islands to pay fines of almost SEK 20 million for failing to enforce sufficiently effective bans on snuff there. This is even though snuff on the Åland Islands is a traditional product, which there too has replaced cigarettes and saved lives . Moreover, the Commission does this and has the nerve to claim that it means well and refers to concern for the health of the Ålanders. But I have talked with the latter, and they politely reject this. It is therefore on the Commission’s conscience if smoking increases on the Åland Islands. However, I know that there are still Members here who are sceptical and do not really believe that it can be that simple, that the statistics are not really as clear-cut as I say. I would ask you to meet me halfway, at least on one point, and to vote in favour of Jules Maaten’s proposal to evaluate the health effects of snuff. Let us have the facts on the table as a scientific basis for further debate. I am convinced that it will be the first step towards lifting the EU’s indefensible ban on snuff. Thank you, Mr President.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank the Members for a very interesting debate. It was good to hear different views. I must say that I am very happy that the majority supports smoking bans and all the other measures that promote smoking prevention.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, we must not forget that the main target is to protect young people. Do not forget that that new ideas come up all the time. The new fashion now is to promote smoking among young girls as a weight-control measure. All means are being employed to promote smoking, so we have to be imaginative and comprehensive in our response.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that some Members are reluctant for the Commission or the Community to take measures. They say that we should wait for Member States to play their part. As I have said, we are now in the process of examining and studying what the next step should be at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I must say that, even though the trend is very encouraging – over the last few years there has been a tremendous increase in countries introducing very comprehensive restrictions – the longer we wait to take measures, the more people die. We must not forget that. It is a very important factor.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is the issue of subsidiarity, but subsidiarity does not mean doing. Nor does Article 152 mean that we should just sit back and watch people die. It means that we should complement, support, encourage and even legislate when it is necessary. We do have the legal basis – we have the opinion on that. So it is a matter of a policy decision, not a legal decision. That is something we will be working on.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said from the beginning, what is important for us is how we can best achieve results, not the legal instruments we employ to do so. Do not forget that the new Treaty, agreed just two or three days ago, specifically mentions the European Union’s involvement in the tobacco issue. That should be borne in mind as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s Green Paper refers mostly to a smoke-free environment, and the debate mainly focused on that area. However, that is just one measure. We have to take a series of measures to achieve our goal. We need a smoking ban, which I will come back to in a minute; advertising bans, which we already have; warnings and pictorial warnings, which we have covered; and also educational campaigns.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is true that this is a lifestyle choice, and that people will eventually make their choice. However, we have to help them take their decision based on the true facts and, in a way, counterbalance the aggressive marketing techniques of the tobacco industry, which is spending billions of euros. We have to be able to advise and explain the problems to people, and also give them incentives not to smoke or to give up smoking. That is a very important area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning smoking ban exceptions, these are better than having no ban at all. I accept that. However, the fact is that this will not make things as effective as with a comprehensive smoking ban, with this being not only for the protection of passive smokers, as I have already said, but also an incentive for smokers to quit and a disincentive for non-smokers not to begin smoking. We should not undermine that. It is not strange that the majority of smokers also support the introduction of smoking bans, because they want to smoke when they decide to and not to have to breathe everybody else’s smoke.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not a theoretical discussion. I know there were concerns a few years ago and, because this is a new debate, concerns are still being expressed. However, we now have some experience and we know that it works, and we know that it does not lead to smoking somewhere else. There is now a reduction in the number of smokers and smoking-related problems and, at the same time, we have seen that it has not affected certain sectors of the economy where there was a worry. So we can draw on those experiences and explain to Member States – and even Members of this Parliament – who are reluctant what the benefits are and how effective they can be.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the issue of ingredients and additives, we are working on this. We are taking very seriously into account Parliament’s position. Mr Florenz has been nagging me on this for the past few years. We are proceeding with that, but it needs a lot of work because the directive, as originally adopted, was not functional. So now we are trying to streamline the provision of information, and we will proceed with the assessment of the risks involved.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning illegal and illicit trade, we are working within the context of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and are currently working a protocol to control that trade. The European Union is very active in this respect, and will remain so.</p>
      <p sl="en">I again want to emphasise that we are not acting against smokers, and agree with those who have made that point. On the contrary, all these measures will benefit smokers as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I know the issue of ‘snus’ is a sensitive one for one Member State. However, I have to say, first of all, that the case of Holland is totally different because that Member State did not ask for a derogation, as Sweden did. However, at the same time – and I would be happy to have a more thorough discussion on this – snus is not a safe alternative. It is just as dangerous, as it causes different forms of cancer and different forms of illnesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">Very soon, at the beginning of next year, we will have all the evidence. I am actually quoting Swedish experts. So it is not a question of the rest of the European Union, which is not using it, showing prejudice. I am quoting Swedish experts who have shown me a huge pile of evidence in this respect. Snus might not cause lung cancer, because it is not inhaled, but it has effects and causes problems. At the same time, there is no evidence that it can be effective as a tobacco-control or smoking-control measure. I would therefore be very reluctant in this area, and really doubt there is any scientific evidence allowing this.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I have to say that I can see a tremendous effort on the part of the tobacco industry, because it now feels threatened by smoke-free policies, to promote snus. We should be cautious in this respect, because it could cause other problems and it could be expanded and promoted in an aggressive commercial way. I would be very reluctant to change the status quo as it stands today in the European Union, and we have the judgment of the European Court of Justice to support us in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I should like to thank all the Members again for this very interesting debate. I take note of those who support and those who are against the Commission’s policies. It is very important for us to hear all your views. I shall be having a more thorough discussion with you in the near future – next year – with a specific proposal from the Commission based on the discussion today.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Smoking is a major public health problem that claims several hundred thousand victims every year, including non-smokers. As this is a problem on a global scale, it calls for multifaceted action, commitment on the part of Member States, and effective legislation that is even tougher than hitherto. Protection of European citizens’ health demands this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Clearly, the road to achieving the primary objective, a smoke-free Europe, will be a long one, requiring tremendous effort and commitment. For this reason, we have to take things one step at a time. Several Member States have set an example that we should follow, taking sound and effective action to avert the dangers of passive smoking. One of the next steps should be to introduce a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed workplaces, including the catering sector, all public buildings and all public transport within two years throughout the whole of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="hu">To combat smoking successfully, we need a sound basis, a comprehensive Community strategy based on relevant studies and the best empirical knowledge, aimed at controlling smoking and encouraging people to quit. Planning effective legislative measures, prevention and education all have a key role to play in such a strategy.</p>

      <p sl="et">Only tough PR can explain the fact that whilst 86% of Europeans believe that the workplace should be smoke-free, only 61% think that the same should be true for bars and restaurants. Ladies and gentlemen, waiters and bar staff also have a right to life and to health protection!</p>
      <p sl="et">Each year 80 000 people die from passive smoking. Regardless of their own wishes they have breathed in a mixture of 250 carcinogens and toxins.

      <p sl="et">None of this is news. Yet 30% of European Union citizens are smokers. The free market economy has not stopped an unhealthy habit which causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and costs taxpayers billions.</p>
      <p sl="et">It is clear that lawmakers must act. I agree with the report that only a 100% smoke-free environment is an environment which can meet today’s health requirements.</p>
      <p sl="et">In addition to a ban, however, we also need measures which help smokers free themselves from their addiction. We need only look at the sums spent by the tobacco industry on advertising to understand the enormity of the challenge we face.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the recommendation by Gianluca Susta, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement (08934/2006 – C6-0359/2006 – 2006/0060(AVC)) (A6-0403/2007)</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-391" speaker_id="36396" name="Gianluca Susta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretariat of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in Parliament for the support it has given me. I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as Mr Van Hecke, who preceded me in covering this dossier, for the excellent work carried out and for managing to maintain the unity of our institution right through to the end.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my opinion, this has been Parliament’s greatest strength in the campaign to promote access to medicines in the developing and less-developed countries where they are most needed. The right to health and access to health at affordable prices are fundamental rights and should be guaranteed for all citizens. Unfortunately we know only too well that this is not always the case: all too often the prices imposed by the pharmaceutical industry are too high, with the result that countries where they are most needed find themselves in difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="it">For this reason, as I have already said on several occasions, both in the Committee on International Trade and in plenary, Parliament could not blindly accept the Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement as if it were a universal panacea, and then consider the matter resolved. Parliament wanted more to be done, at least within the European Union, because the European Union can and must do more.</p>
      <p sl="it">Even in the light of the regrettable events of this summer, such as the exchange of letters with Thailand, even if partially resolved, the European Parliament, which has always been a great advocate of using all the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreement, could not give the go-ahead for the ratification of the protocol without obtaining real and effective guarantees from the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it is fair to stress that during these months of close collaboration with the Commission and the Council, we have undoubtedly achieved an important goal for the European Union, by putting an essentially technical dossier at the top of the European political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the end result can be qualified as a success, not only for this reason, but above all because we have succeeded in making progress in extremely sensitive areas, such as encouraging the use of the flexibilities provided for under the TRIPS Agreement so that we can promote access to essential medicines at affordable prices within the framework of national public health programmes.</p>
      <p sl="it">I particularly support the explicit reference contained in the Council Statement – presented on Monday – to Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement. For my group, this represents a guarantee and an assurance that Member States will be able to use this instrument without coming under pressure and that there will be easier access to medicines in countries where they are most needed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Secondly: I am also delighted at the results obtained in terms of TRIPS-plus, namely the more stringent provisions as regards those provided for under the TRIPS Agreement. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed that there should be no negotiations in future bilateral or regional agreements with developing countries on provisions that might have negative consequences for health and access to medicines.</p>
      <p sl="it">Despite this, while recognising the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, I would like to ask whether the text of the statement can be further improved, particularly in the section referring to poor developing countries. This expression could create confusion, since it is now customary to refer only to developing countries and to the category of less-developed countries. To insert a new category would complicate the situation. Above all, it is important to stress that all developing countries, hence even countries such as Brazil, India, etc., must be able to use the current system without running the risk of pejorative provisions being introduced in future.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last but not least, it is vital to underline the efforts made to date in terms of the transfer of research and technological development to southern countries. The ALDE Group is ready to give its assent because it believes that a ‘no’ would send out a negative signal to the countries most in need, and would be irresponsible on the part of the European Union given that the reopening of the WTO negotiations is unrealistic.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, this does not change the fact that we continue to have reservations about the efficiency of the mechanism studied and approved by the WTO. For this reason, and I am almost at the end now, I would like to confirm that the EU will not stop here. Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the guarantees that have been given over the past few months will be honoured in practice.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore we ask Commissioner Mandelson, who in his letter confirmed that he did not intend to negotiate TRIPS-plus provisions, to remove from the draft Economic Partnership Agreement with the Caribbean countries the request for adherence to and acceptance of the obligations of the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Patent Law Treaty and the intellectual property provisions of Directive 2004/48/EC on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, which unequivocally resemble TRIPS-plus provisions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very pleased that we have been able to find a solution agreeable to all on the important issue of access to medicines for poor, developing countries. Our debate during the last months has been fruitful and I would like to thank Parliament for the intensity and the quality of our exchanges. The Commission has always been receptive to the concerns expressed by Parliament and, indeed, shares most of them. That is why the Commission was at the forefront of the debate on TRIPS and access to medicines in the WTO.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have seen in this debate an opportunity for the Commission to clarify its position on a number of issues. We all agree that the amendment of the TRIPS agreement is one part of the solution among many others to the problem of access to medicines. Obviously, other measures are needed, in particular to improve health care systems and the infrastructures, notably in poor, developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some Members fear that the mechanism will not work. This is certainly too early to assert. In our regulation implementing the waiver, and together with Parliament, we agreed to evaluate it three years after its entry into force, and we will do it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also support the work of the intergovernmental working group with the WHO to explore other measures to further improve access to medicines.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has been able to reaffirm its attachment to the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement on public health and its support for the flexibilities contained therein.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, this debate allows me to dispel any misunderstanding about what the Commission is doing in the economic partnership agreements with ACP countries. Let me confirm that, in those agreements and in other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries, the Commission is not asking and will not ask for provisions which could affect access to medicines or undermine the TRIPS flexibilities contained in the Doha declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thanks to this frank and direct debate Parliament is now in a position to give its assent to the Commission proposal. The European Community will then join the other WTO members which have already accepted the TRIPS agreement. This acceptance will enable the EC to continue to play a leading role in the WTO on the issue of access to medicines.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to insist that access to medicines remains a priority for the Commission and I am willing to continue to work in a constructive spirit with Parliament on this matter in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that the Council is not represented in our debate this evening because for once it is our main contact. The atmosphere here is euphoric, everyone is in agreement and tomorrow we are going to vote – by a crushing majority, I think – for the ratification of this amendment to the TRIPS agreement, which is supposed to provide and should provide better access to medicines for countries that are not sufficiently developed and do not have a pharmaceutical industry that allows them this access.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What happened during the long debate we have had on this, is that Parliament was a little more doubtful than the Commission about the efficacy of this system. I believe – and I would like to thank the Council here for having listened to Parliament more than the Commission, for once – that this is what led to the statement distributed on Monday morning, thanks to which we have accepted that an agreement between us enables us to make this small step forward. It is an improvement, but it is an improvement the inadequacy of which we are aware of and regarding the effectiveness of which we have a few doubts. These few doubts need to be removed by the stringency with which the Member States and the Council apply the recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am delighted, however, by what has just been said by Mr Mandelson, who has himself announced a group of experts to find other measures, and an evaluation of these measures, and I think we will be discussing these matters again once we have seen whether the effectiveness meets our expectations. In any case, I am pleased about the positive conclusion to this necessary stage, even if it does not go far enough.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, as rapporteur of the European People’s Party I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sousa, and my other fellow Members for the productive cooperation we have enjoyed, for it enabled us to overcome certain differences between political groups and to maintain a united position on this important issue. The European Parliament has not been limited to areas of responsibility as laid down by the Treaty; it has not been restricted merely to giving its assent. In the July resolution a political victory was achieved expressing a united will transcending party politics.</p>
      <p sl="el">Making commitments by the Commission and the Council was sought and achieved. They coincide to a great extent with the views of the European Parliament. It could be said to have been a rehearsal for institutional cooperation in light of the new role the European Parliament will play once the Reform Treaty has been adopted.</p>
      <p sl="el">The acceptance by the Union of the amendment is thus backed up by real commitments, which ensure the process works successfully. The commitments also go much further: they lay down guidelines for an integrated approach to the issue of the public health of developing countries. The acceptance by the Union of the amendment to the TRIPS Agreement sends a positive and hopeful message to developing countries. We hope that it will also involve the active cooperation of other members of the WTO.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during our last debate in July on access to medicines, I concluded my comments by calling on the Council and the Commission to make clear and formal commitments that would guarantee Europe’s active involvement in finding new solutions and its desire to be a front runner in the fight for access to affordable medicines for everyone. We could not be content with a debate in which no precise commitments were made, and I note today that, after several months of exchanges between the three institutions, certain proposals we had made and that we really wanted are becoming a reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First allow me to applaud the parliamentary work done, and done with a constant concern for accountability and openness. The three successive postponements of the vote in Parliament were motivated by a commitment to global public health. This showed us that the word ‘solidarity’ still had meaning in European policies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore like to thank first of all our rapporteur Mr Susta for his powers of persuasion and capacity for resistance, and all the shadow rapporteurs from the political groups, who throughout these months of collaboration, effort and Common conviction, have risen above party politics to show the quality of work that Parliament can produce. I therefore hope that the Council and the Commission will be able to demonstrate that the commitments made over the last few months during our various exchanges and in the written statement we have received will be respected.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These commitments are: that the Member States are free to use all the clauses allowing them to produce generic medicines and export them to developing countries, and not only to poor developing countries; that these developing countries can use all the flexibilities in the Doha Declaration to provide their populations with the essential medicines they need; that the European Union will not negotiate public health-related provisions in negotiations on trade agreements – and I also note the statements by the Commissioner; and finally that the EU will finance projects to develop research and manufacturing capabilities in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are positive steps forward, and we want to make capital of them now, but I would like nevertheless to say that not all the issues raised by Parliament, or its legitimate concerns, have necessarily met with the desired responses from the other institutions. Our fight for access to medicines for everyone in the world goes on. That is why we will remain extremely vigilant regarding the application of the commitments made by the Council and the Commission today, and at the same time we will continue to demand that all our concerns receive a rapid, adequate response in the coming months. I recall that the first of the commitments made to Parliament was to complete the evaluation of the mechanism that we are to adopt tomorrow. Doubts persist over this, and they need to be addressed. Should that not be the case, in line with the commitments made to the developing countries concerned, the EU should draw the appropriate conclusions to come up with a truly viable, sustainable solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am therefore pleased about the commitments made by the Council and the Commission, and I will therefore call upon my group to vote in favour of ratification tomorrow, even though the long weeks of work we have just experienced lead me to think that, far from reaching an end, the collective agreement we have made is only just beginning.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The WTO decision of 30 August 2003, which provided for a temporary derogation from the TRIPS Agreement, has now been transformed into a permanent derogation by a new decision of 6 December 2005. In his report, Mr Susta makes a number of very pertinent remarks on the practicability of compulsory licensing. I recognise very many elements from my 2005 report transforming the temporary derogation into a European regulation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I fully support the recommendations of the Council and the Commission, which Mr Susta links with the avis conforme . The mechanism created is indeed only a limited solution to the problem of inadequate access to medicines in poor countries. The EU must help developing countries find a long-term solution in terms of obtaining the most essential medicines at affordable price, and must stimulate investment in local production facilities. The transfer of technology, research and technical assistance are of course essential in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this regard, I would refer to recent reports stating that the market share of generic medicines is falling once again, and giving the cause as the cheap production by pharmaceutical companies themselves of medicines whose patent protection has expired. This must present opportunities for poor countries, where, in line with the WTO decision, compulsory licensing can offer a solution in respect of medicines still protected by patents.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we do not want to give vain hope to the millions of people still unable to benefit from the most essential medicines, more – much more – will be needed than a mechanism whose practicability is and remains highly dubious.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, as it happens, 14 years ago I was involved in the issue of intellectual rights in the Polish Parliament, as chairman of a special subcommittee. Today I have the honour of doing the same in our European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Like those who have spoken before me, I would like to emphasise the significant progress that we have made over the last few months, and I would like to stress that, as we see it, the European Parliament has done a lot to put right what was proposed by the European Commission. I am thoroughly convinced that the compromise we are proposing will help to improve access to pharmaceutical products in Third World countries, as they are what mainly concern us.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, if I have understood correctly the Council will read the statement before the vote, otherwise there will be no binding commitment. I would then ask you to omit the word poor developing countries. It is completely irrelevant and meaningless in previous agreements. There are developing countries and there are the least developed countries, and Parliament wants both these groups of countries to be able to benefit from these mechanisms. It is clear that we are speaking the same language here. It is something I was wondering about in your speech, Mr Mandelson: you said that ACP countries had nothing to worry about, but then you also said poor developing countries, ACP countries. I hope that we are not restricting the discussion to them, and that your letter to Thailand does not set the limits for this, but that we are perfectly clear that developing countries which are not among the poorest also really need to be able to protect public health in order to be able to develop effectively, and that we must give them all the help and support we can. I hope that we agree on this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has been called upon to express an opinion on whether the amendment to the WTO agreements on intellectual property – the ‘TRIPS Agreements’ – can be made permanent, as this would represent a swift solution to the problem of access to medicines by developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Considering that up to now, this amendment has offered no proof of its real effectiveness, it is important for the European Parliament to seize the opportunity offered by the ratification of the TRIPS amendment to secure greater guarantees that EU policy on access to medicines will be comprehensive, coherent and effective.</p>
      <p sl="it">The TRIPS Agreement, as the Council has recognised, represents only part of the solution to the problem of access to medicines and public health; it is important therefore that the Council, as emphasised several times by Parliament, should declare its support for all those countries who intend to take advantage of the flexibilities offered by the TRIPS Agreements, to be able to provide essential medicines at affordable prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union must do more to stem the health crisis in the world’s poorest countries, particularly by ensuring that these countries can meet their own needs, without burdening them with bilateral or regional agreements, the ‘TRIPS-plus’ Agreements, on provisions relating to pharmaceutical products that risk having a negative impact on access to public health and medicines.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also believe that it is the task of the Commission and the Council to support WTO initiatives to make TRIPS rules less complex, and specifically to maximise product availability.</p>

    <intervention id="2-400" speaker_id="28300" name="Zbigniew Zaleski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, halfway through it has transpired that among the millennium goals, we have done worst in combating TB, HIV and malaria. World Health Organisation statistics show that in 2005 more than one and a half million people died of TB, which had a high mortality rate in Europe before World War II. Each day 27 000 people die because of a lack of access to basic medicines.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Health is an inseparable condition for wellbeing and economic development, and I believe it is our moral duty to help less well developed countries in this respect. One positive step is to provide support for the protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement in order to allow access to medicines. It is not a complete solution, but we cannot not take the risk if we are to protect the lives of millions of people.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a risk. To begin with, obtaining a licence for the production of generics for export to countries in need is hedged round by numerous conditions that might put people off such an undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, production of medicines of this type may create circumstances for abuse on the part of both the beneficiaries and the exporters themselves, and on top of that the infrastructure in poor countries is so weak that it is just not possible to undertake production there. For this reason some kind of extra, multi-level aid instruments are needed. It seems to me that the most important thing is financial aid intended for setting up local production centres, technology transfer, and investment in development and innovation. We are obliged to show social solidarity with these countries, but we are the ones who have to work out a way that will do most to increase the effectiveness of the aid provided while at the same time protecting our own market.</p>

      <p sl="de">In this procedure, Parliament's only options are to agree with the proposal or reject it. The way that Mr Susta, the rapporteur, and all the shadow rapporteurs – and here I would like to thank particularly Kader Arif from my group – have handled it increased considerably the predefined scope for Parliament to take action.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for expressly pointing out that this accord, this Protocol, which we will vote on tomorrow and which Member States will then be able to ratify, is only a building block – an important one, but only a building block – and that there are many more steps to be taken to give developing countries with no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector a real opportunity, which they need, to provide their citizens with essential medicines.</p>
      <p sl="de">This step will help us in our cooperation and it will especially help us when Parliament gains further rights of consent in the many other policy areas, in the area of trade, for example.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, given the ethical importance of this issue, the discussion that we are engaged in is of great political relevance. The dichotomy between protecting intellectual property and promoting the health and well-being of the populations of less-developed countries arises out of a conflict of interests that can be resolved only by a comparison of values.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Simply put, this opposition is clear. On the one hand we have a certain debatable model of protecting intellectual property based on the argument of the incentive for innovation and the consequent expansion of scientific knowledge, while on the other are millions of poor human beings, living in countries with scarce resources who cannot be condemned to suffer and die for economic reasons at a time when we have the knowledge that can save their lives.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This comparison makes it clear on which side the fundamental values lie. In this light, at various times and in various places certain steps have already been taken to make the intellectual property protection system more flexible so as to promote access to medicines for all. However, it turns out that progress so far is not sufficient. The mechanism now being considered is merely a means of easing such a distressing problem.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We need to go further. Parliament has pointed in this direction, making a decisive contribution to encourage the EU to adopt a position in line with its underlying values. The solution now found reveals this concern and I would therefore like to commend the Presidency of the Council for its efforts to achieve, through statements and commitments, a position that shows Europe at its best: a political community always set on irrecusable humanist values.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A6-0245/2007) by Mario Mantovani, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning (COM(2006)0479 – C6-0294/2006 – 2006/0163(COD))</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-406" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Peter Mandelson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mantovani and I would like to express the Commission’s thanks to him and to the responsible committees for their proactive engagement and supportive stance throughout the negotiations on the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning.</p>
      <p sl="en">This recommendation goes to the heart of what the EU is about: mobility, cooperation between countries, promoting prosperity and helping individual citizens. We propose the EQF because you, the European Parliament, and the Member States asked us to find ways of promoting mobility and lifelong learning, without which we cannot achieve the Lisbon goals. The EQF has been developed within the Education and Training 2010 work programme, the education dimension of the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EQF seeks to overcome the barriers that remain to European workers and learners when they wish to change jobs or move to another country for work or for study. Too often, Europeans have difficulty in using their qualifications in another European country. Even in their own country they find their educational pathways blocked by poor integration of the different parts of their national education system.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EQF will relate the countries’ different national qualification systems to each other, acting as a translation device. It will thus make other countries’ qualifications more readable and so enable individuals to move to another country if they wish to work or study.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the national level it will – indeed it is already doing this – stimulate the development of national qualifications frameworks. Qualifications frameworks promote lifelong learning by, for example, making it easier for people to move between different types of education and training institutions, for example from vocational training to higher education.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should acknowledge that the EQF is a technical, even complex instrument. It will be used mainly by experts and educational authorities, but it is for the benefit of the citizen.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are debating today is the product of a collective endeavour between the Commission, countries, social partners, education and training associations and other stakeholders. The EQF has very much been built on a consensus and we have sought to carry stakeholders with us throughout the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EQF recommends that countries relate their qualification systems to the EQF by 2010 and ensure that individual national qualifications carry a reference to the appropriate EQF level by 2012. These dates were proposed by the Council and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also been happy to agree to the insertion of a new recommendation on quality assurance proposed by Parliament, which we feel reinforces the importance of these principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also agree to Parliament’s proposal to include a reference to credit systems which recognises the rapid development and application of these components of qualifications frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that Parliament and the Council have indeed improved the text. The approach adopted in the negotiations by the Parliament, Council and Commission reflects the consensus behind the EQF across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is now a momentum behind the EQF; the great majority of countries recognise its potential for mobility and as a lifelong learning instrument.</p>
      <p sl="en">A large majority are now developing a national qualifications framework related to the EQF, so this proposal is already having a major impact on Europe’s education and training systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope you can agree to support this proposal at first reading so that it can formally be adopted by the Council in the coming weeks.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that tonight marks the beginning of a major project which Europe, the Member States and the regions and cities of the European Union have been waiting for for a long time, a goal that various stakeholders in the fields of education, employment, trade and the economy have been working towards for years, and something that society as a whole wants.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tomorrow, with the approval of the European Qualifications Framework, we will lay the foundations for a better tomorrow, giving future generations a common point of reference for their cultural, educational and vocational engagement, training and of course employment.</p>
      <p sl="it">In keeping with the Lisbon Strategy, the European Qualifications Framework represents a direct channel for improving links between schools, universities and the workplace, and between formal, informal and non-formal lifelong learning, ensuring transparency in the recognition of qualifications and certificates, both at national and sectoral level, and always within the European framework. Finally, it will strengthen cooperation between Member States in the sensitive area of comparing different systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is the recurring theme which, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy, has led us to assume the proper responsibility, with a choice that I am certain will promote growth, development and competitiveness in a Europe obliged to recognise social cohesion as one of its objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is a longstanding project, arising from the Bologna process as the system of accumulation and transfer of credits as an equivalent, before surfacing again at the Barcelona Summit system for vocational training. It was improved at Bergen in 2004, and again in the 2005 Council, which reiterated the need to adopt the current framework. An historic journey that clearly illustrates the ambition of European decision-makers to create a new instrument, considered by many as revolutionary, but necessary for the European integration process which we have been persuing for so many years.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am convinced, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that this framework will not only encourage cross-border mobility, but will act as the driving force for the EU’s internal mobility – if we think of students, workers, researchers and volunteers in general, and all those who need to move freely through Europe without causing panic or undue concern. You must remember the story of the Polish plumber, which terrified France: it was one of the main reasons why the French voted against the European Constitution in the referendum.</p>
      <p sl="it">Well, the text we now have before us is the result of many months’ work, of close collaboration with the Council representatives under the Portuguese Presidency, which immediately saw the importance of this ambitious project.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission, in the person of Commissioner Figeľ, has kept a close eye on this process throughout, and it is thanks to this spirit of partnership that we were able to improve the text, inserting key concepts close to the heart of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. For this, I am extremely grateful to my colleagues, to the shadow rapporteurs – I see Mrs Castex, Mr Kusstatscher, the liberals – as well as Mr Mann and Mr Kasoulides, and all those who contributed to this. Thanks to their generous involvement and commitment, we were able to include the following concepts: social integration; the requirements of the labour market; personal development along different training paths; non-discrimination with the inclusion of disadvantaged persons; equal opportunities; respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of coordination points within the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">We also made sure that the recommendation was non-binding, even though it remains legislative in nature. Obviously this was not down to any weakness, but came more from a sense of responsibility and realism in order to encourage and promote the application of this instrument in those countries that need more time. In short, there is no doubt that it can be improved, but in this life everything can be improved. However, I am convinced that we have before us a text with a soul and a conscience.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is my belief that the job of the European Parliament is to legislate in the real interests of citizens. Well, this is what we have done here. The approval of the text at first reading is evidence of this, partly thanks to Mr Gaľa on the Committee on Culture and Education, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which all made a positive contribution.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, because he has really tackled a subject that goes much further than we might imagine.</p>
      <p sl="es">Really, in a globalised world, Europe and the various EU countries will be defined by the qualifications of their human resources. If we had to summarise in one pillar what it is that is going to enable Europe, and all the countries that make up Europe, to be competitive in this global world, it is the qualifications of the human resources, the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">With this in mind, it is absolutely essential that lifelong education and training should be adapted to the demands of the labour market and constantly respond to them. If this is not the case, it will be impossible to compete.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will also come up against the following paradox: people are getting older, but these older people are getting younger and potentially more active, yet they have insufficient resources to continue being productive and giving to society and finding fulfilment in the world of employment.</p>
      <p sl="es">With this in mind, the first aspect is that lifelong training, based essentially on a technological dimension, which is what gives added value, should be a fundamental concern. There is, however, a second aspect, which concerns the future of Europe, and this is integrating these human resources into a competitive internal market, for which qualifications are needed that are recognised by all Member States, which will enable citizens from different countries to compete with each other based on training that is recognised by all.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, because it is necessary for individual development in such a competitive world and because it is necessary for the development of the internal market, this is a subject that has much greater importance than it is perhaps being given by being debated so late in the day.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, for his work on the report on the European Qualifications Framework. We have been debating this subject in the European Parliament since spring 2006. As we know, a strong mandate for the European Qualifications Framework is an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy. It will serve as a translation device between different qualifications systems and their levels, and its implementation will result in greater transparency, comparability and portability of citizens’ qualifications in individual Member States. In addition, the European Qualifications Framework will help international sectoral organisations to improve the links between their sectoral qualifications systems and national qualifications systems, thus helping to increase the mobility of workers and learners.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, I express my support for the non-binding nature of the European Qualifications Framework in the Member States and for the creation of national qualifications systems in accordance with national legislation and practice. However, the European Qualifications Framework will become an effective instrument for recognition and comparability of qualifications at a European scale only if it is consistently implemented as a part of the lifelong learning systems in the EU Member States. Since the EQF is directly linked to the way in which citizens assert themselves on the labour market and affects the quality of vocational education and training, it can also be considered a relevant tool for boosting competitiveness.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-411" speaker_id="1922" name="Thomas Mann" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE-DE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, the European Qualifications Framework is the starting signal for the emancipation of vocational training at EU level, as it will enable vocational qualifications to be recognised throughout Europe, just as academic qualifications are. This takes time and requires a willingness to cooperate, coordinate and change mindsets. People who defend only what they know, and shy away from new experiences, should not be surprised to find that they lack mobility.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need greater clarity. National training qualifications must be comparable, although this does not mean that they have to be standardised. I already called for this last year, in the EQF own-initiative report that I prepared for Parliament. A great deal has happened since then. Fears that Member States would lose powers have been allayed including in my country. Lifelong learning and the EQF were major milestones of the German Council Presidency, which was acknowledged as successful. Now it is full steam ahead with creating a national qualifications framework, which is not exactly easy, given Germany's federal structure and the autonomy of each Land.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Mario Mantovani on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for his tenacity in dealing with the Commission and the Council and for keeping everyone in the Groups who followed the EQF informed. I do hope that the report will be adopted in the first reading tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">From now on, there is a need for much discussion between trainers, teachers and training institutions, as we go into the details. I experienced this just yesterday in a meeting with vocational college teachers in Hesse. When ranking qualifications, for example, the German Master Craftsman or Tradesman Certificate belongs in at least the third or fourth of the eight levels. Others are not familiar with this qualification at all. The strength of the German dual system is not apparent to people unless they have experienced it for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our European teaching and learning workshop, which is based on the principle of subsidiarity, the employment and vocational policy dimensions will be considerably strengthened in education and training. Together we must and will achieve an ambitious goal: to incorporate a quality standard, the EQF, in certificates and diplomas by 2010.</p>

    <intervention id="2-412" speaker_id="28148" name="Françoise Castex" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent consultation on this recommendation on the European Qualifications Framework. I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council for listening and being available to everyone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the EQF we have a tool that serves the mobility of European citizens, whether as part of training pathways or as part of professional mobility. Free movement of persons, which is written into our Treaties, is still hindered by citizens’ difficulties in having the qualifications obtained in their country of origin recognised throughout the EU. These qualifications, which are awarded by each Member States, according to its own procedures and systems, come under the sovereignty of each Member State and the EQF respects this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, qualifications increasingly need to be used outside the country in which they were awarded, something we wish to encourage out of respect for the value that the diploma or other qualification gives to its holder. We therefore need a tool for comparing and especially for converting qualifications from one Member State to another. This is a particularly necessary and sensitive issue for professional qualifications. That is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was keen to incorporate professional qualifications into the EQF. This has been done and we are glad.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Employees and companies are increasingly mobile in the European job market. However, employees and employers therefore need guarantees, in all Member States, concerning those things that measure the competence and value of a worker, namely their professional qualifications, regardless of how they were acquired.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I would, however, like to underline one other point. At the moment the EQF is a nice but empty shell. For it to exist properly, the diplomas, qualifications and certifications created in each Member State need to be calibrated and registered against references in the European Qualifications Framework. This will constitute a large amount of work for all the Member States, and will require a lot of energy and specialist expertise. The European Commission’s support will be essential, as will that of the European agencies – I am thinking in particular of Cedefop. The participation of the social partners will also be essential, at all levels. They must be involved, as the recommendation states, by the Member States and the sectoral dialogue committees at Community level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, for the EQF to be complete and effective, it will also be necessary for the economic partners, the professional branches, to understand and appropriate it for themselves. This is not only because they award the qualifications that should be included in the EQF, but because companies need benchmarks for classifying their jobs and for recruiting. The EQF rapidly needs to become their common reference framework and I dream of an appropriate deadline by which the EQF will be the reference framework everywhere, even in collective agreements.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all, I must commend Mr Mantovani on preparing this very significant document.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The principal aim of this document is to find a way of determining and comparing different qualifications within the labour market and education system.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Without doubt, the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) will have a beneficial impact on the efficiency and flexibility of the EU labour market. More importantly, the EQF would help to reduce discrimination against both immigrants and EU citizens in the workplace.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Unfortunately, both Lithuanians and citizens of other EU countries have difficulty in using their qualifications in other Member States. Very often their qualifications are not recognised by employers or institutions.</p>
      <p sl="lt">People feel discriminated against, because they do not have equal opportunities to compete in the labour market. They often have to accept jobs which pay less and for which they are overqualified. At a meeting with Lithuanian nationals living and working in London, I was made aware of quite a few complaints regarding discrimination in the workplace and difficulties in obtaining the work for which these people are qualified.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It makes them feel like ‘second-class’ citizens, yet their qualifications and skills are often much higher than those of the citizens of those countries doing the same kind of work. They cannot get the job they want or an adequate salary, simply because their qualifications are not recognised.</p>
      <p sl="lt">To sum up, this document is of great importance to most people. Regretfully, neither the Commission, nor we Members of Parliament, have been able to solve this problem in 22 years.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In 1985 the Council decided to introduce a system to match different countries’ professional qualifications. It has not yet yielded any results. Unfortunately, once again, we are in no hurry and are proposing not to introduce it until 2012. Moreover, it is being left to the Member States’ discretion.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, establishing the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is something that is of significance to the Europe of today and of the future. Whether a person will be fulfilled in their personal life and in society depends, after all, on that person’s preparation for life and for work. Historical and contemporary determinants have given rise to a need to devote particular attention to people aged 50 and over and to young people from families experiencing economic difficulties, especially in the new Member States. Not all of them can, or should, go abroad in search of work. Conditions need to be created for people to develop in their own environment, in the place where they live. National qualification frameworks should mean an instrument serving to classify qualifications in line with criteria laid down for specific, attainable levels of study. The European Union should support the efforts of Member States both legally and economically. The Union should offer citizens not only the potential for free movement, but also recognition of their occupational qualifications.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, thank you very much to Mario Mantovani, who followed the footsteps of his neighbour on the bench in this question.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have before us the result, which will require educational authorities in the Member States to use this shared framework as a translation device and a reference point. There is plenty of room for more pressure to be applied for greater transparency, better comparability and thus equality and recognition of different qualifications within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">I particularly welcome the fact that vocational training is specifically mentioned alongside general education, and given equal status, and that not only formal diplomas will be measured against the standard but also informal skills that people gain in the workplace or at home.</p>
      <p sl="de">Tricks are often used to make access to the labour market more difficult. Not infrequently, educational authorities, vocational boards and professional associations attempt to resist competition from outside by being reluctant to recognise tertiary and vocational education qualifications gained elsewhere, for reasons of form. In 2010 that will be a thing of the past.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ‘encouraging lifelong learning’ sounds fine, does it not, with the EU working openly for the good of people and for employment?</p>
      <p sl="de">Only this morning, Mr Barroso said that he did not like opt-outs, but was in favour of compromises to respect diversity. Those are fine words, but here we are with yet another attempt to bulldoze wonderful diversity into a common, harmonised, featureless landscape.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now it is the turn of education, broadly speaking. However, education is not within EU competence! It is only covered by proposals under Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty. So this is also an attempt to smuggle in a competence by the back door. If the EU wishes to assume competence over education, let it do so honestly, go through the usual channels and employ the transparency we hear so much about.</p>
      <p sl="de">Following the model of the Bergen Framework, setting up the EUROPASS diploma and certificate supplements with the European credit transfer system will require a harmonised EQF level. By issuing qualifications at sectoral and regional level, as well as at national level, this EU proposal will ensure an almost complete grip on qualifications. By issuing grades and awarding qualifications it will ensure that the EU bypasses universities and national governments.</p>
      <p sl="de">The UK Government is in favour of harmonising qualifications. It is preparing for this by placing control of the universities under the Privy Council, ready to hand universities over to the EU. What universities think of this seems to be immaterial.</p>
      <p sl="de">HMG’s true position is revealed by its only objection to this scheme. It does not want the EU logo on the qualification documents. That is because they do not want people to know that education has been handed over to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Please tell me, why is it that my Government has taken that stance? Why is it in favour of an EU project but wants to keep it from the people? Are other national governments taking the same line? I would not be surprised if they were, because they, too, may wish to keep it from their people that their universities are being used in this way.</p>
      <p sl="de">You may gather that I do not like this project, but it is not for reasons of national pride in Britain’s universities and colleges. No. It is because, as a teacher, I value education and recognise that European countries have universities of which they are justly proud – great centres of learning whose alumni have contributed down the centuries to the arts, literature and science, enriching the lives of people everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">I recognise also that this impetus to civilisation came about because those seats of learning evolved separately and independently, with each developing its own particular flavour and identity.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is strange, is it not, in an age in which personal identity is being jealously guarded and identity theft is regarded as the crime it is, that some people thoughtlessly seek to destroy the unique identity of the institutions which made them what they are, denying others the education they acquired there?</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we should not have been able to debate the proposal to recommend a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) today had not our fellow Member, Mr Mantovani, made good use of the experience of former MEPs working on the subject or collaborated so well with the Commission and the Council. Today we can thus deal with setting up the eight qualification levels covering general education, adult education, vocational education and training, and the three levels of tertiary education qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="el">In answer to my fellow Member who spoke previously, we stress that Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty are the right legal basis for the proposed recommendation simply because they allow for lifelong learning. Under no circumstances do we accept that education should be an EU area of responsibility: it remains the preserve of national responsibility. Comparing qualifications within the EQF, however, ignores teaching methods and types of educational establishment. As a result, such a comparison refers only to knowledge, the capacity to understand, and the practical application of knowledge and skills.</p>
      <p sl="el">Greece and many other states are particularly keen on the optional nature of the EQF. The view has officially been expressed that promoting qualifications league tables has nothing to do with shaping the national educational system or recognising certification for studies. Besides, for non-formal and informal education, because of its diversity and the special circumstances under which it is acquired, automatic certification is not possible, but a mere reference.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is a decisive document to enable the national and sectoral reference frameworks of qualifications to be compared at European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The certification of qualifications obtained is essential to enable progress achieved outside formal education, especially in working life, to be integrated with advances achieved in the formal systems. It thus contributes to greater democratisation throughout the EU as regards the management of personal professional careers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This directive, as moreover one of the amendments proposed and approved in Parliament emphasises, promotes the validation of these qualifications in accordance with the Council conclusions on common European principles for the identification and validation of non-formal and informal learning.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this will enable us to advance towards a single European legal framework that aims to be coherent without diminishing the guarantees that in some cases exist already. Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive that we are discussing will be a decisive tool for greater flexibility on the labour markets, offering a better defence of workers’ interests and a better chance of providing quality services. At this point I can only welcome the Portuguese Presidency’s efforts in the field of education to move surely and relatively quickly towards approval by Parliament at first reading. It is clear that in these circumstances we should also highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur Mr Mantovani and the shadow rapporteurs, notably Mrs Castex.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order to be more effective, to derive more benefits from professional and academic mobility in the European area we need to work even more effectively in implementing the European Qualifications Framework and in linking it to the European credit system, and this report promotes a significant advance in that direction. Thus, the proposal for a directive promotes equality of opportunity in the knowledge society we live in, with the aim of better integrating the labour markets of the various Member States, taking account of the rich diversity of the various national systems. It therefore deserves a positive response from us.</p>

The introduction of the Qualifications Frameworks will give rise to greater social cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European reference framework will reduce the complexity of a system with 27 bilateral relations for the recognition of qualifications obtained from academic and professional education. The Bologna Process of creating, by 2010, a European Education Area is thus supplemented by an instrument of recognition of all qualifications that may be obtained in the Union’s Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although 9 out of 10 European Union citizens believe lifelong education is an important instrument for career development, the lack of financial resources leads to big deficiencies in the training required for the current economy. A recent eurobarometer shows that only 58% of the respondents are able to use a computer, and only one half of them declare that they are Internet users. Moreover, over 60% of the citizens cannot use a foreign language in their work. National budgets designated to lifelong education vary from 40% of the total amount used for education in Northern countries to under 10% in the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thus, initiatives such as Grundtvig or Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs should be extended and doubled by funds that would supplement the insufficient national finances.

The European Qualifications Framework is a key instrument in overcoming this discrepancy and also a tool to re-assess and re-organise the vocational orientation and information system.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The development of the EQF will facilitate the mobility of manpower within the 31 participating countries and promote the involvement of sectoral and industrial organisations from the new EU Member States in the absorption of resources from the European Social Fund allocated for the acquisition of new qualifications or upgrading of the existing ones.

      <p sl="hu">Recognition of citizens’ knowledge, skills and competence is indispensable for the European Union’s competitiveness and for social cohesion, as well as for individual citizens’ mobility. Participation in lifelong learning and access to lifelong learning for all, including the disadvantaged, must be fostered and improved at both national and Community level. Young people, adults, immigrants and manual labourers throughout Europe who have informally acquired skills that have never been recognised must be encouraged to participate in lifelong learning programmes, thus avoiding social and labour-market exclusion of these groups.</p>
      <p sl="hu">To do all this, an important role can be played by a common reference framework that serves as a translation device between different qualification systems and their levels, whether for general and higher education or for vocational education and training.
