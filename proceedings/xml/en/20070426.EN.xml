      <p sl="en">Mr President, I do not wish to hold up the proceedings, but I and others tabled a text for a written declaration concerning the fact that the Bureau of this Parliament had reversed its decision to introduce a total ban on smoking in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have received communications from the services and now from the President stating that a written declaration on an internal matter of the Parliament is not within the rules. However, if you look at the Rules of Procedure it is very clear that a written declaration may concern any matter within the field of responsibilities of the European Union, which clearly this is. Could I therefore ask through you that the President refer the matter of interpreting the rules on this point to the committee that is responsible for interpreting the rules, namely the Committee on Constitutional Affairs?</p>

    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Joaquín Almunia" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I am going to read the Commission statement on relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and although you and I speak the same language, I shall do so in English.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Commission is pleased that this item has been put on the agenda because it is now more than two years since we last discussed Switzerland. It was in 2004, on the occasion of the conclusion of the 10 new bilateral agreements. Let me start, therefore, with a general remark.</p>
      <p sl="es">The bilateral and multilateral relations that link the EU and Switzerland are very good. Switzerland is a highly valued partner for the EU in many areas. Our bilateral relations are based on a solid foundation of around 20 important and over 100 smaller sector-specific agreements. These agreements range from free trade in goods and the free movement of persons to Swiss participation in our research and Schengen cooperation. Any existing differences should not have an inordinate impact on our relations.</p>
      <p sl="es">In February, the Commission adopted a state aid decision on Swiss cantonal tax favours for certain types of companies, in particular holding companies. This decision has received much media attention in Switzerland and has been dramatised, by some, into a major conflict.</p>
      <p sl="es">Legally, the Commission has no doubts that the cantonal tax schemes qualify as subsidies, because these tax regimes offer unfair tax advantages to companies established in Switzerland for profits generated in the European Union. Income generated in Switzerland is taxed higher than profits made in the EU. This unequal treatment is at the heart of the state aid problem. The rules in question are liable to distort competition and may affect trade between Switzerland and the EU. All criteria of Article 23 of the agreement of 1972, the provision which declares such state aid incompatible with the proper functioning of the agreement, are therefore fulfilled.</p>
      <p sl="es">Politically, too, it seems hard to accept that a neighbouring country that enjoys privileged access to our internal market and takes part in a large number of our programmes and other activities should grant such tax favours. The benefiting companies are often set up with the sole aim of avoiding the taxation of profits in our Member States. I would like to point out that tax schemes of this kind or similar are not allowed inside the EU, pursuant to the state aid rules set out in the EC Treaty. In the past, the Commission has adopted decisions against them. We are not against tax competition, which also takes place among the Member States, but it must be fair.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission wants to find a mutually acceptable solution. Therefore, we also asked the Council in February for a mandate to start negotiations with Switzerland on this topic. Member States support the Commission in this respect, and such a mandate is currently being prepared in the Council. I am also counting very much on Parliament’s support in this matter. We proceed from the belief that we will find a solution for this problem, just as we have always found solutions for problems in our relations with Switzerland in the past.</p>
      <p sl="es">On a different matter of importance, I would like to express the Commission’s expectation that Switzerland will, hopefully, soon be ready to negotiate the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons. If Switzerland were to exclude the citizens of two Member States from this very important agreement, it would be unacceptable for legal, institutional and political reasons.</p>
      <p sl="es">Bulgaria and Romania should also receive a financial contribution from Switzerland for the reduction of economic and social disparities, on the same terms as the other 10 new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">In view of the Swiss position on EU accession and the European Economic Area, there is currently no alternative to further strengthening of bilateral relations. With that in mind, the Commission is prepared to look into the Swiss proposal for the negotiation of a general framework agreement, provided that it brings an added value to our relations, for instance with regard to the updating of existing agreements in line with the evolving Community acquis .</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the statements made today by Commissioner Almunia. I believe that these statements also largely meet with the consent of my group. The relationship between the European Union and Switzerland has been a special one since time immemorial. Commissioner Almunia touched on the various agreements.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this respect, our partnership with Switzerland is characterised by particularly close cooperation but which has not, as yet, ended up with Switzerland becoming a member of the European Union. Nevertheless, Switzerland is an extremely important trading partner as well as being a friend and neighbour. I find this particularly congenial since my electoral district directly borders Switzerland. I would therefore like to appeal to all sides not to jeopardise these good neighbourly relations by means of stubbornness or excessive demands placed on one side or the other.</p>
      <p sl="de">The tax dispute has already been touched on. The topic of Switzerland would certainly also be cause for a comprehensive discussion here in Parliament. Today, however, as has been described by Commissioner Almunia, we are obviously concerned with the subject of fiscal practices. On this theme, I would like to say that, unlike our colleagues from Great Britain, for instance, and representations to the contrary coming out of Switzerland, we are of the opinion that this issue does not involve intervention in a country’s right to levy taxes, but is more an issue of whether enterprises which belong to the European single market, and which may enjoy the advantages afforded by this single market, are receiving unjustified subsidies. We are talking about the principle of equal treatment and the abolition of hidden subsidies. In this respect, the approach adopted by the Commission, that the Swiss have to apply some finishing touches here, is the correct one, even if it may have been more prudent to begin with negotiations instead of a procedure. The statement that it is a matter for the canton is neither applicable nor effective in my opinion because what we are talking about are hidden subsidies which must be abolished.</p>
      <p sl="de">For its part, the EU must clarify the fact that while it naturally respects Switzerland’s sovereignty on tax matters, the EU’s basic principles, which Swiss enterprises also benefit from, must apply to all enterprises within the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to point out that we must find a solution to this problem in the interests of European enterprises, as well as its citizens, to which both parties have contributed. That is why I am calling on both the Commission and our Swiss neighbours.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="1985" name="Pervenche Berès" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PSE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome your statement, because you have taken note of what we have been saying for some time now, namely that the practice that is being developed in certain Swiss cantons – without mentioning the main ones of Zug, Vaud and Schwyz – constitutes a violation of the 1972 agreement on forms of State aid that contradict the rules of fair competition and that affect the nature of trade between the European Union and Switzerland. The fact is that Switzerland, as a friend of the European Union, benefits from the same conditions of access to the EU internal market as any Member State. You cannot have your cake and eat it, meaning, in this case, that you cannot have both the internal market and exceptions for certain Swiss cantons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not a question here of referring to this or that media figure among natural persons, but indeed of referring to substantial sums that are at stake due to the practices being developed by certain legal persons. Therefore, once a problem has been identified between friends, it should be dealt with. This is what you are proposing to do. You will have my group’s full support in this matter, and I am delighted that other groups in this House share this approach.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as Switzerland is concerned, we are told that Swiss internal affairs are being interfered with. However, in an international trade environment, freedom is not unilateral. Account must be taken of others’ circumstances, and the freedom of one party stops where that of the other begins. I believe that, when it comes to our excellent relations with Switzerland – and President Barroso reiterated this when he was in Bern the other day – this is how we must act.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At times, Switzerland has been able to divide and rule among Europeans, and everyone will recall the circumstances in which, after the Feira conclusions had come out and we wanted to adopt the Directive on the taxation of savings within the Union, some people used Switzerland to divide us. I am delighted that the conditions for negotiating the mandate granted to the Commission will clearly enable the Member States to speak with one voice, while showing respect for Swiss sovereignty. That is a very good sign, in my view.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I should like simply to make an obvious point: when one considers the logic of the Swiss taxation system, the idea that a taxation system should take account of external costs is absolutely integral to the Swiss thinking on taxation. To put it plainly, certain Swiss practices confirm the fact that, from the moment that production does not take place on Swiss soil, the cost of infrastructure or of employing qualified workers does not have to be incorporated in the taxation system. We must – at the very least in terms of trade with the European Union – highlight the following situation: as the taxation system developed in certain Swiss cantons currently stands in relation to that of the EU Member States, we are losing revenue, since these production activities are being developed on our territory and the tax on the capital gains generated in this way is being channelled into Switzerland to avoid the need to provide any funding for these external costs. I wish you luck in the negotiations.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="4544" name="Diana Wallis" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his statement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Here in Parliament we have long wanted to discuss the whole of our relationship with Switzerland and to celebrate Swiss success in three successive referendums on EU issues – referendums that would scarcely have passed in many of our Member States. Although Switzerland is not a Member State, Swiss people are informed Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="de">We wanted to discuss the interesting government report on European policy last autumn to recognise that, yes, the Swiss wish at present to pursue their own national interests outside membership, but also perhaps to counter some misconceptions about what might be on offer here. In my view it amounts, as the Commissioner has said, to building on the bilaterals and perhaps a framework agreement that simplifies the administrative load on both sides. However, what some of us would call ‘membership-light’ is not on offer, and that is where the current difficulties over cantonal tax might stem from.</p>
      <p sl="de">Either you are a member of the European Union or you are not. Switzerland is not, and both sides do well to recall that. Switzerland does not enjoy the benefits of membership, nor is that country subject to all of the obligations. That is the difficulty of such an atypical, variable geometry: it will forever throw up problems and sources of irritation. However, those problems should be solved with goodwill.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take the tax issue head on. If what the Commission really wants from Switzerland – which I suspect to be the case – is to extend the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation, then let us talk about that. Even between Member States it is a voluntary code. I have no doubt that there are offshore taxation arrangements in a Member State I know only too well that would not bear close scrutiny, yet I do not see such activity from the Commission in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need a discussion as benefits the relationship between the EU and our nearest geographic neighbour in the heart of Europe, a country providing our second largest export market and an inspiration to us and many in terms of its democratic structures and internationalism. Instead, we tell the Swiss that their cantonal tax systems are ‘predatory’. That is a strong and unpleasant word. If they are indeed predatory, I would expect to see a line of obvious cases of actual harm to Community trade: practical examples that could be cited and demonstrated as having this predatory effect. I have seen none mentioned. Indeed, the Commission relies instead on an argument that it does not have to demonstrate but merely show that the structures could have this effect. However, there are no actual examples and I wonder whether that is because, under examination, they would not stand up against the strained argument that is put forward – an argument against a non-member state, based on an old free trade agreement, designed primarily to deal with the trade in goods.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us look at it in another way. Perhaps my voters in Yorkshire might wonder why I spend so much time on Switzerland. However, if my northerly region of England had enjoyed over the years the level of fiscal autonomy vis-à-vis London that Swiss cantons have in their country, maybe we would not have been such a drain on EU Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="de">Switzerland contributes financially to our enlargement process with popular consent. This is a deep and complicated relationship, one that over the years I have found exasperating and frustrating, but never, ever dull! We are often told to be nice to the Swiss before a referendum. We are asked continuously what we will do if they vote ‘no’. The answer is that the choice is always that of the Swiss people, but if they wish to work with us, we have to work with them in a respectful and proper way. The best I would like to see is that one day there are Swiss ministers in the Council, a Swiss Commissioner and Swiss colleagues here with us to debate these issues, not us doing so at second remove.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on relations between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation provides us with an interesting and timely opportunity to reflect briefly on what we can learn from the ancient democracy of the small, yet historically important federal republic of Switzerland.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the Swiss federal tax system were well known to the taxpayers of the EU Member States, it would be a model to be imitated – as indeed it is – especially with a view to protecting economic freedom.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would remind the Member States’ taxpayers that Swiss legislation is based on important principles, such as the principle of legal equality, the principle of economic freedom and, above all, the principle of the guarantee to property.</p>
      <p sl="it">The principle of legal equality imposes the duty to tax according to economic capacity. Thanks to constitutional provisions, the principle of economic freedom forbids the collection of certain taxes on trade that would be prohibitive in the context of trade policy. Lastly, the important principle of the guarantee to property, enshrined in Article 26 of the Federal Constitution, forbids the imposition of tax when it takes the form of expropriation; thus the guarantee to property constitutes a limit to taxation.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is what needs to be learnt by those Member States which, like Italy, still oppress taxpayers with their tax legislation and tax burden, which in Italy exceeds 40%. From this great historical experience, we need to learn the principles of economic freedom contained in the Swiss Constitution. Those of us from Padania have the good fortune to be the next-door neighbours of those free people of Switzerland.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, let us also think about the principle of freedom of belief, on the basis of which people are not obliged to contribute taxes to pay for the costs of religion if they do not belong to that religion, and also the fundamental right to express one’s wishes directly through the referendum on taxes. It is time to do away with the Member States’ fiscal dictatorship over taxpayers! Let the people have their say on taxes!</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="28255" name="Andreas Mölzer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ITS Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Swiss citizens rejected entry to the European Economic Area back in 1992, no one would have been able to imagine today’s emerging developments. On the one hand, both the EU and Switzerland are benefiting from cooperation and bilateral agreements, for instance, in connection with security and asylum. On the other, we have relentless negotiations, demands and even blackmailing, for example, in connection with the extended freedom of movement of persons and the taxation of savings income, or currently in connection with company taxation as regards which, it is the intention to use derogations relating to rail transit, which are so important as far as Switzerland is concerned, as a means of exerting pressure.</p>
      <p sl="de">When Switzerland tightened its Asylum Act many years ago, the European Union did not hold back with its criticism. This was designed to clamp down on the 75% of applications for asylum which were incorrectly submitted every year, which is actually what happened. This about-turn by Switzerland, which has traditionally been so welcoming to visitors, forced those persons within our Union who dream of multiculturalism to reconsider, and the Union actually had to make an example of this Swiss Asylum Act.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now is the time for us to seek solutions together to common problems which we face in the tax sector, as well as with regard to migration and integration. Above all, we should use Switzerland as an example in terms of direct democracy, for only if EU citizens are once again under the impression that their intentions are being taken seriously, that they can have their say in matters, might we then be able to extricate ourselves from the crisis currently facing the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">The disputes surrounding the EU Constitution and additional EU enlargement offer adequate opportunity to use Switzerland as an example.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="1318" name="James Nicholson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Union has many bilateral agreements with Switzerland. These have seen the prospering of both the Swiss and Member States of the European Union. The bilateral agreements should be recognised by all representatives of a joint and shared desire for prosperity. There are further indicators that show the things we share and the direction we are heading: amongst other things, Switzerland is the second-largest trading partner of the European Union after the United States. 900 000 EU citizens live and work in Switzerland, while many more travel between these borders on a regular basis. However, the present disagreement between the Commission and the Swiss Government is disconcerting and should be addressed swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="en">I realise that the issue of double taxation which the EU and Switzerland are facing is no small one, but I would not like to see threats made in the preliminary rounds of negotiations, or in later rounds for that matter. The issue of double taxation does not offer an easy way to investment, jobs and revenue for the Swiss cantons that allow the double standards. The Council and Commission and Parliament should do its utmost to protect the interests of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish you well in your negotiations and look forward to a positive outcome.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all, I would like to thank Commissioner Almunia for the information he has presented about relations between the European Union and Switzerland.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, I would like to hear what Mr Almunia has to say about the ultimate political goal of these relations. In other words, is the development of closer relations between the European Union and Switzerland undertaken with an eye to membership of Switzerland in the European Union at a future date; if so, when can we expect this, and what must Switzerland and the European Union do before then? If the development of closer relations is not aimed at Switzerland's membership, but is aimed instead at a privileged partnership for Switzerland with the European Union, then what should be the principles of such a partnership?</p>
      <p sl="lt">I do not think that bilateral agreements definitively solve the problem of Switzerland's political future; therefore, I would like to hear from Mr Almunia something similar to a road map , from which one would be able to see the direction of the Commission's work in developing the European Union's relations with Switzerland. From the material presented it is hard for me to say whether the Commission has such a road map , or whether temporary agreements are a substitute for it.</p>
      <p sl="lt">My proposal would be as follows: it is necessary to produce a road map of the development of relations between the European Union and Switzerland, the ultimate goal of which would be either Switzerland's membership in the EU, or its privileged partnership in terms of the yet-to-be approved Constitutional agreement. In order to choose either solution, it is essential to know the Swiss people's own opinion about the prospects for their country.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Until we solve this political problem, we will continue to make various agreements, and both parties to the negotiations will try to demand more favourable conditions for themselves at the expense of the other party.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As I study the existing and planned agreements, I have serious doubts as to whether we might just be making greater demands on Switzerland, which is still not a member of the European Union, than on the European Union Member States themselves. In my opinion, the opposite should be the case.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I hope that Commissioner Almunia might disperse my stated doubts by responding to the issues I have raised.</p>

    <intervention id="4-020" speaker_id="28355" name="Mieczysław Edmund Janowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Switzerland is viewed as a historic example of European integration by many people. We need only to think of Jean Jacques Rousseau or Johannes von Müller. However, it seems to remain an island, a Sonderfall , beyond the united Europe which surrounds it on all sides.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us remember that, in a referendum held in 1992, 50.3% of Swiss citizens themselves voted against their country joining the European Economic Area. I do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of the Confederation in any way. In highlighting the good cooperation between Switzerland and the European Union in almost all areas, I hope that the right solution can also quickly be found in terms of taxation. This is extremely important in order to achieve transparency in terms of our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On behalf of the new Member States, including my own country, I would specifically like to welcome the outcome of the referendum held on 26 November 2006, which accepted the establishment of a Swiss Financial Instrument to the tune of one billion francs. For their part, these countries have flung open their doors to Swiss capital investments. In Poland, for example, imports from Switzerland rose by 20% during this period, while exports increased by only 5% less. I am sure that Swiss funds will be used sensibly for innovative purposes, including scientific research, providing support for small and medium-sized companies, as well as protecting the environment and fostering regional development.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to add that Switzerland has a particularly positive image in the European Union. According to my data, around 72% of Europeans would be happy to welcome the Swiss Confederation into our common European home. Perhaps it would be wise to make the most of this positive attitude.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-021" speaker_id="4555" name="Daniel Hannan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, why are the Swiss doing so much better than us? Why is the Helvetic Confederation richer, more content, more orderly and better administered than the European Union? Allow me to suggest a reason. Switzerland is founded on what one might call the ‘Jeffersonian principle’: the notion that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the people they affect. The European Union, by contrast, is founded on the converse principle. The very first line of the very first article of the Treaty of Rome commits us to an ever-closer union. Whereas power in Switzerland is dispersed, power in the EU is concentrated, and from that one structural flaw come most of our present discontents: the unintended consequences of our directives and regulations, the inflexibility of our policies, the sense that the government has become remote from the governed, the determination of our national electorates to vote ‘no’ to Brussels at every opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why then do we keep bullying and hectoring the Swiss over their refusal to join us? Why do we attack their success in keeping their cantonal taxes down? Why do we encourage that minority of Swiss legislators who see EU membership precisely as a way of sidestepping their voters and escaping their system of direct democracy? Is it that we envy our neighbours their success or is it that we fear that our own citizens will be encouraged by their example to demand independence for their own states?</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me propose an alternative approach. Instead of seeking to drag Switzerland into our Union, why do our Member States not instead apply to become cantons of their confederation? They are, after all, getting something right, these Switzers!</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there are many referenda in Switzerland and this is one of the reasons why I would not want to be a canton in even such a pleasant country. Switzerland is a wealthy country, which does not have to be a member of the Union and, at the moment, does not wish to join the Union. At the same time, it is a good, strategic partner for the European Union. When one has such a partner, Commissioner, one negotiates and discusses, rather than initiating proceedings. I agree here with my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. As a Polish MEP, the case of Switzerland reminds me of the unfortunate and, until now, unsuccessful attempts of certain German and French politicians, such as Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, to unify taxation in the European Union, which would de facto lead to an increase in tax in my country. There will be no consent to this move. I am therefore not surprised that the Swiss now complain about Brussels interfering in the internal affairs of their country. This whole matter shows that the Union should take a look at itself. It should reform its own economy in such a way as to make it truly competitive, without resorting to proceedings, penalties and demands addressed to third countries or its own members.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, allow me just a few words.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I wish to insist that the Commission considers relations between the EU and Switzerland to be very good. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had the opportunity to meet the President of the Helvetic Confederation on 3 April. They discussed these very good relations, which do not exclude some legal problems, which can be likened to those which exist among the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Every time the Commission considers that the Treaties or Community legal provisions are not fully respected, as guardian of the Treaties, it is obliged to react. This has been the case with the issue under discussion: the tax decisions adopted in some cantons of the Helvetic Confederation. It is not about tax competition. It is about the enforcement of the rules that were adopted in our Agreement with Switzerland of 1972. It is not about tax competition but state aid. The Commission very often opens this kind of procedure on the grounds of failure to enforce state aid rules in the Member States, and it is a very important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not know whether you are aware that over 20 000 letter-box companies have been established in Switzerland with the sole purpose of avoiding taxation in the European Union Member States. We have been discussing this issue with the Swiss authorities since 2005. We have not found a solution other than to open this procedure. We are asking the Council for a mandate to negotiate with the Swiss authorities to reach a solution to this conflict. I hope that, in the coming weeks, the Council will give us this mandate with the backing of a very large majority of the Member States. I hope that during the negotiations, these issues, which constitute sizeable problems for thousands of European companies, will be resolved.</p>

      <p sl="es">This is the result of many contributions over this period of time not just from my colleagues in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, but also from disabled people’s organisations and from the European Commission at the meeting with Commissioner Špidla.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report was approved almost unanimously within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality with just one abstention and that makes it clear that this is a balanced report, which is intended to highlight not just the situation of disabled women but also the extremely important role played by women responsible for and dedicated to care and assistance for people suffering any kind of disability, as well as the work of the associations involved in it.</p>
      <p sl="es">This report – which we will vote on later in this House – contains an important appeal: the need for both the European Commission and the Member States to try to introduce and implement flexible measures and a system of assistance that reflects the heterogeneous nature of this group of people, so that they can be applied and adapted to each case, since there is no place for stereotypes here, and women generally suffer double discrimination. On the one hand, because they are women – which is still a handicap in many European regions, regrettably – and, on the other, because they are disabled.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to provide appropriate resources and policies, with innovative services, in order to guarantee the most independent and autonomous life possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to stress the importance of the development of information and communication technologies, a fundamental tool in the integration of disabled people into society.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is important to increase public awareness from childhood, since it is they, the children, who hold the key to the future in their hands.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must continue to promote consideration and debate in order to progressively reach a situation in which equal opportunities are a reality for everybody, regardless of their gender or their social, economic or political status.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like, finally, to stress the role of families – in particular women, who in the majority of cases are responsible for caring for disabled people – and the crucial role played on a daily basis by associations of disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is essential that the work of families and organisations be supported and recognised, from both economic and social points of view, since in many cases it is an activity that requires full dedication, leading to isolation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, and although this is a subsidiary issue, I believe that we institutions of the European Union must consider all working together to that end.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is concerned about disabled women, who are victims of double discrimination: on the grounds of gender and on the grounds of disability.</p>
      <p sl="es">The different forms of discrimination suffered by disabled women and young people prevents them from living independently, since these barriers often deny them access to education and to the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is entirely unacceptable that around 80% of disabled women are victims of violence. The risk of suffering sexual abuse is four times higher for disabled women than for women who are not disabled. The European Union must protect the rights of these people and allow them effective access to all forms of protection.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank Mr Herranz, who has had the initiative to draw up this report with a view to increasing public awareness of the dramatic situation I have just referred to.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, it is entirely appropriate that this Parliament should be adopting a resolution on the situation of disabled women in the European Union. The draft resolution is absolutely right to mention the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by the European Commission on behalf of the European Community on the same day that it became available for signing, 30 March last. At least 22 Member States have added their signatures. Furthermore, I would like to point out that the Commission inspired the specific provisions of that Convention on respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of disabled women.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament's adoption of this resolution is also fully in line with the European strategy in the field of disability, a strategy that contributes to the implementation of the measures mentioned in the report. The Commission is therefore already working on the application of the provisions of the directive combating the discrimination suffered, in particular, by disabled people who want access to employment and professional training. Furthermore, the new regulation on the Structural Funds introduces the use of accessibility for disabled people as a criterion for the selection of projects.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also take note of the appeal to the Commission that it draw up legislation to guarantee the autonomy of disabled men and women. In this regard, the Commission intends to launch an impact study to look into the possibility of proposing new legislation in this regard, on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, which makes it possible to extend the scope of the current directives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the Commission will shortly begin a study on the current situation of disabled women, taking account of the provisions of the United Nations Convention. This study will provide us with a basis for defining specific actions, and will also make it possible for the Commission to gather data and information.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The report produced by my colleague Herranz García calls upon us to change our view of disabled people. We must, together with them, ask what solidarity they really need, and furthermore, we should accept everything these people offer as testimony to the undeniable value of their lives. But I ask myself whether political institutions at all levels are able to take this step. As a doctor and a woman who sympathises with disabled women, I do not view their situation as a punishment, but as an area in which human society can gain great inspiration and a beautiful fountainhead for a world founded on solidarity, hope and love.</p>
      <p sl="sk">People with disabilities are a very great source of inspiration for us. With their moral and spiritual resources they are of irreplaceable value to the human race. They show us and teach us that human beings have value simply through the fact that they exist and not through what they possess or through what they are able to produce. European society, which is often in thrall to the pernicious influence of economic neo-liberalism, does not understand these things. A person with disabilities represents a living challenge to our shared humanity.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This report is also a challenge to us to show respect to all of those who, formally or informally, care for people with disabilities. The formal recognition of those who care for people with disabilities should be the aim of all institutions. I would therefore like to conclude by requesting that the European Commission undertakes a study into the recognition of informal work in the field of caring for people with disabilities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, as far as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is concerned, this report, which puts women who have to live with disabilities at the heart of our work, is extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are a range of legal instruments, such as the UN Convention, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 13 [of the Treaty on European Union] and the Manifesto of Disabled Women which we should observe very closely. At all levels, it is clear that women are not victims; rather, they are repeatedly disadvantaged. This multiple discrimination must also be reflected in measures adopted by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have designated 2007 as the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities for All’. Here too, however, women, especially women with disabilities, constitute a marginal group. As has been stressed so unequivocally by Commissioner Almunia, 80% of women with disabilities are also victims of violence, everyday violence. They repeatedly experience violence and, above all, sexual violence on a very much more frequent basis.</p>
      <p sl="de">The DAPHNE programme must therefore put a stronger emphasis on combating this violence and we must also strengthen the networks of women with disabilities. In their working lives, women have it doubly difficult if they suffer from a disability. They already suffer in any case. Unemployment levels among women are above average and the social exclusion of disabled people is increasing at a rate which is no longer acceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must therefore use the best model from all European countries as an example and make much better use of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund for promoting model projects and remind Member States of their duties. We have written gender mainstreaming into the structural regulations but do not have the funds available to proceed with sanctions against the Member States which do not abide by it. This is a fairly central requirement. It is clear that greater pressure must be applied here.</p>
      <p sl="de">We require integrated education. This is necessary for both sexes. It is a very important learning curve for people both with and without disabilities to be prepared as early as Kindergarten to live an independent life. To this end, we must not let charity prevail and we must quite definitely help men and women obtain their rights as well as establish barrier-free access for them, and not just to buildings and public local transport, but to new media as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also hope that the Gender Institute can help bring the organisations and best practices together. Every one of us may wake up tomorrow suffering from a disability. What matters is strengthening each person’s individuality and valuing his or her uniqueness. Then we really will be in agreement on many issues.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for a constructive and incredibly important report.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that attention needs to be given to the situation of women with disabilities, and measures taken to remedy that situation. People with disabilities are discriminated against, and women are discriminated against. There is, then, double discrimination against women with disabilities, not to mention the further discrimination that exists against those that happen to be women, disabled, of a different ethnic background and of a different sexual orientation.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is the Member States and society that have a responsibility to remove all obstacles to everyone participating fully in society. In particular, account needs, then, to be taken of the situation of women with disabilities. It should never be the person with disabilities or her relatives that bear the responsibility. We have a collective and common responsibility to build a society characterised by solidarity, and full participation by everyone in all aspects of that society - for example study, working life or social and cultural life - is something for which we should take responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In quite a few Member States, it is women who bear the main responsibility for the care of children with disabilities and of relatives in a similar situation. I read an extremely telling quotation by the mother of a child with disabilities, who said: ‘I am not only a mother but also, among other things, a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, nurse, neurologist, teacher and architect specialising in adapting our home for the needs of our disabled child.’</p>
      <p sl="sv">Not only are women carers, then, but they also have to fight for the rights of people with disabilities. I think that it is very clear from this report that it is women who often bear the main responsibility. That is unacceptable. It is not women’s but society’s responsibility to enable all people with disabilities, together with their families, to lead independent lives and to make decisions for themselves. This is also, of course, a demand for gender equality.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Girls and women with physical and mental disabilities are subject to more violence and sexual abuse than other groups. Not only, then, do they suffer discrimination because of their disabilities; they are also subject to abuse. Women with mental disabilities, in particular, are open to abuse, often perpetrated by people in their immediate circle. These women are in a dreadfully vulnerable position. If we are to prevent abuse, we must be aware of such violence and afford it greater visibility.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is not our sympathy that women with disabilities need or demand, but the self-evident right to participate fully in society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, a society is judged by its attitude towards the weak, sick and disabled. That is why all actions aimed at providing support for people who are disabled, ill or who have difficulties in adapting to their surroundings, not only prevent social exclusion or poverty, but also foster social integration, as well as improving the quality of life and the mental and physical health of people who are in some way disabled, allowing them to lead a fulfilling life.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All action taken to provide more information and increase awareness of disability and which includes providing disabled access to buildings, educational opportunities, reducing red tape in the support system and increasing funding, especially for disabled women and children, should be a priority for programmes at a national and European level. It is important to improve access to the labour market, including Internet access, to make use of tax incentives aimed at promoting the employment of disabled people and to make working time more flexible, especially for mothers with disabled children.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is equally important to make the institutions more accessible, to improve the monitoring of how aid is allocated, to provide physiotherapy services and psychological support across the board and to increase the number of certified therapists and instructors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, providing support and care for disabled people, which helps their physical and personal development, should not encourage selfishness. The problem, especially in my country and in other poor countries which have joined the European Union, is not so much a lack of desire to help people who are in some way physically or mentally disabled, but rather the fact that there is poverty and unemployment, a lack of funds for transport, wheelchairs and other equipment which, together with measures to make buildings accessible for the disabled, would facilitate mobility.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Nearly 15% of Poles are disabled. These people face many problems on a daily basis, in spite of an extensive network of NGOs and legions of volunteers who want to dedicate their time to helping others. In Poland, there is a lack of schools for autistic children, there are not enough reading materials written in Braille for the blind and poor, disabled people cannot afford specially adapted cars. In addition to this, almost all tax relief has been abolished for people who already live in poverty, sometimes even extreme poverty, as a result of low pensions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The previous socialist governments in particular followed macroeconomic goals in their approach to disabled people. They abolished family-friendly tax relief and significantly reduced disability benefits. This happened when the country was adapting its legislation to fall in line with legislation in the European Union, where neo-liberal utilitarianism, rather than human worth and dignity, is what really counts.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The majority of mentally disabled children attend special rather that mainstream schools, which does not help them to integrate. That is why even the most well-drafted and meticulous reports dealing with the issue of disability will remain theoretical entities, with no opportunities for practical implementation, in view of the greed of the wealthy and the fact that moral values and principles have been replaced by market laws and the free movement of capital in one direction, namely from the poor to the rich. That is why we appeal, once again, for solidarity. We need solidarity not only on paper in the Union's documents, but in the decisions and actions taken. We especially appeal to the decision-makers, who are responsible for safeguarding our health and our society, for solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, around 250 million women in the world are disabled. Furthermore, in the European Union, the rate of employment of disabled women stands at 2%, compared with 36% for disabled men. These women are under-represented, and sometimes not represented at all, in many areas of social, professional, cultural and political life not just in France, but throughout Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In France, the law stipulates that companies with over 20 employees must meet the target of having a 6% disabled workforce. However, the average rate of employment of disabled people is in reality only 4%. It is downright unfair that companies should prefer to pay fines – even very large ones, at times – rather than to employ disabled people. However, 40% of disabled women are constantly seeking employment. This grotesque situation must stop.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, I am surprised to note that the techniques of quotas and of positive discrimination, which are widely used by Parliament to, among other things, promote foreigners’ rights within the European Union or female participation in political parties and professional decision-making bodies, are not recommended so strongly for disabled women, or even provided for in this report. Europe is undoubtedly a multi-speed Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a milestone in terms of the rights of people with disabilities, entered into force at the beginning of April. This convention stipulates that all 650 million disabled people worldwide have the same rights as people who do not suffer from a disability. It encompasses civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and thereby offers effective legal protection. For the first time, disabilities are recognised as a human rights issue. It is regrettable, and here I would also very much appreciate another statement from the Commission, that the EU Commission has got cold feet and refused to sign the additional protocol, which would have given individuals and organisations the right of appeal before the UN Committee of Experts.</p>
      <p sl="de">When we here in Parliament talk about disabled people, especially about disabled women and girls, we must ask ourselves time and again whether we would not be better off talking about the impeding environment. When we look at this building and all other institution buildings, including those of the European institutions, it then becomes clear that we still have much work to do in order to actually improve the opportunities available to disabled persons. Here in this House, for instance, a woman or girl with a disability could only get access to the canteen via the freight elevator. This is very regrettable and we must certainly put our own house in order and see that we are also, alas, contributing to these people having no reasonable freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Worldwide, it is primarily women who have to endure a double dose of discrimination. As far as these women and girls are concerned, however, it is very important that we do not just talk about their misfortune, for these women are also self-aware and, although they have a disability, naturally have the same rights when it comes to shaping society.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is especially regrettable that girls and women with disabilities experience much more than their fair share of sexual violence, be it by family members, care staff or other workers. In particular, there is also the fact that as far as these women are concerned, unfortunately, it is also very difficult that they are victims and do not have the same rights when it comes to getting married or starting a family. It is still the case that disabled girls and women are sterilised and forced to have abortions. There are many more compulsory abortions and because such women are not accorded the same rights in terms of sexuality or motherhood, their reproductive rights are also greatly restricted.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to the UN report, only a quarter of women with disabilities are gainfully employed. In this area, we must implement real change at a European level. We also know that, compared to men with disabilities, women, in part, earn just half of what men do. Here, too, we should again ask the European Union for more precise figures. We are already aware that, despite the principle of ‘equal pay for the same work’, glaring differences exist between men and women when it comes to women with disabilities. This is shocking indeed.</p>
      <p sl="de">According to estimates by UNESCO, only 3% of people with disabilities worldwide can read and write, with this figure estimated at 1% when it comes to women and girls with disabilities. Here, we must make much greater efforts in the area of humanitarian aid, but we should also place the topic of educational opportunities and enhanced education, especially for girls with disabilities, quite high up on the agenda once again. In this area, Member States must do much more.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is therefore very important that we get this theme going at a European level and that we focus much more attention in this area. What is very important as far as I am concerned, however, is that our resolution should not fall behind the UN Convention. From there, we must actually make it much clearer that these women naturally do not just want to be seen as victims. They want to make it clear that although they have a disability, this disability should not result in discrimination on the labour market or in terms of education. We must attach greater importance to protecting these women against violence and send out very clear signals.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope that we really can take a step forward with our resolution and not fall behind the UN Convention.</p>

      <p sl="it">As regards its content, I think it is in everyone’s interest if I mention a few key points that characterise our work. Taking my cue from the report itself, my first point is that I think it is important, in our relationship with the Member States, to emphasise that the costs of disability must be borne by the community as a whole. The second point is that all the provisions, directives, projects and plans that are drawn up by the Community institutions must take account of the fact that some people in our countries have disabilities, and that they always constitute an important part of all the provisions that we must adopt. The third point is connected with the need to grant economic and social dignity to everyone involved in the care sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am sure that in every country there is now a prevalent feeling that the right response to the problems of disability is to make the most of everyone’s residual abilities and to place them at the disposal of the whole community. That is the best solution for the differently able and also for all of us.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, in this European Year of Equal Opportunities, which we hope will be for everyone regardless of gender, this report is of particular importance, as it draws attention to disabled women, who are particularly vulnerable to various forms of discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore commend the rapporteur on her work and express the hope that the Commission and the Member States duly take on board the report’s proposals. We know that disabled people and their families generally have more difficulties to face in their everyday lives. They need help and measures that take account of their particular situation, so that they can take full part in the various activities of society.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Hence the need to integrate disabled people’s needs and women’s rights into all policy areas at national, regional and local level, in particular the policies of town planning, education and training, employment, housing, transport, health and social services, including personalised assistance where applicable.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What are needed, therefore, are strong public policies backed by significant investment in particularly sensitive areas, in order to guarantee equal opportunities for women and disabled people. For this to happen, public priorities have to change.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We cannot go on prioritising the nominal convergence criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact and, in turn, cutting public investment, as has happened in Portugal, leading to the closure of maternity wards, emergency services, health services and schools. This undermines human rights, especially in the more vulnerable sections of society, as in the case of women and the disabled.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is wrong to declare that we want equal opportunities for all and to launch a propaganda campaign, only to pursue neoliberal policies that exacerbate inequality and social injustice. More than statements of intent, what we need is political change in order to prioritise social justice and genuine policies of social inclusion and equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender.</p>

      <p sl="el">Yet another European resolution on a vulnerable social group, but to what extent are our proposals here in Parliament implemented? To what extent do they affect the policies targeted at the regions? To what extent are specific and special cases of disability addressed, be the disability major and visible or minor and invisible? To what extent are new technologies and new treatment methods planned for the disabled? How do we guarantee humane care for them? How are the European Structural Funds disposed of to help the disabled in their life, especially disabled women, taking account of the fact that they have full, but special rights to education and work and life. As my honourable friend, Mr Breyer, so rightly said, disabled women also want to have a full family life.</p>
      <p sl="el">We must, of course, remember that it is women who take care of the disabled and that they too have rights, in order to be able to help. Do we ensure that women looking after the disabled have the possibility of developing the qualifications they have acquired from this work, so that they can re-use them? Do we recognise the service of women in the family, in schools and in the community? Do we recognise their voluntary service? Today we have an opportunity not only to vote, but also to see how – with specific measures – we shall implement everything we want for disabled women.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think everyone in this House would agree that disabled women are often the most vulnerable individuals and the EU's values urge us to protect and to enhance the opportunities for disabled women. One way to approach this problem is by creating more education and labour market opportunities for women with disabilities, thereby granting them independence and alleviating the pressure on their carers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without adequate education it is very difficult to gain access to today’s labour market and to prosper. However, incorporating educational programmes for those with disabilities into our school systems and encouraging lifelong learning among women with disabilities would allow these women to support themselves and to maintain their independence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Member States should also encourage employers to hire disabled citizens by creating economic incentives to do so. The proposal in the motion for a resolution is a move in the right direction in that respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">No two people are alike and, even when we begin to categorise and label people, we must remember that every human being is individual and has unique needs. The EU Member States must take this fact into account when considering legislation related to women with disabilities. Women with disabilities constitute a very diverse group and all actions designed to support those women must take account of this diversity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, this is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Yesterday we started a European truck tour to send this message to everyone in Europe. I think that alleviating the plight of women with disabilities is a very important priority in the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.</p>

Europa va avea succes doar dacă utilizăm creativitatea tuturor cetăţenilor săi.

În acest sens, cred că utilizarea tehnologiei informaţiei şi a comunicării va ajuta persoanele cu handicap să se integreze în viaţa economică şi socială.

      <p sl="unknown">The Conference of Presidents has instructed me to provide you with the wording of a press release issued yesterday by the President of Parliament and to make an additional comment in relation to this statement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">By a very large majority, the Conference of Presidents adopted the content of a press release which the President of the European Parliament issued yesterday on the issue of Mr Bronisław Geremek’s mandate. Yesterday’s press release reads as follows:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">‘The European Parliament has not, as yet, received any communication from the Polish authorities concerning Mr Geremek’s mandate: Bronisław Geremek is a politician of high standing who has always supported democracy in his own country and European integration. We will examine all legal avenues to ensure that Mr Bronisław Geremek may continue his work.’</p>
      <a text="(Loud applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">My statement from yesterday continues as follows: ‘According to our information, the Constitutional Court in Poland is currently also investigating the questionable law on which the withdrawal of Mr Geremek’s mandate is based. A decision by the court is expected over the next week. I have commissioned the European Parliament’s legal service to check the exact legal position. This topic will also be discussed tomorrow by the Conference of Presidents.’</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, this has just happened and the Conference of Presidents conveys its sympathy and solidarity to our fellow Member, Mr Bronisław Geremek.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the increasing fear of job losses, which has not only resulted in an increase in the incidence of various illnesses and, consequently, high costs on the part of enterprises and health insurance companies, combined with the associated risk of poverty, also diminishes the possibility and inclination of European women to have children. However, children should no longer be the cause of a poverty trap and the conscious decision to have a home and family should not be punished by living the life of a pauper. If we continue to drive forward with our policy of putting people in full-time employment and safeguarding jobs, we will not only reduce the level of absence caused by illness but may also help bring about a rise in the number of children again.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The questions of workers’ health and working conditions, the organisation of health, hygiene and safety services in the workplace and the list of occupational diseases came to the fore in the Community in 1989 with the publication of Framework Directive 89/391. Other directives covering various aspects of hygiene and safety at work have since been adopted.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The adoption of this report will hopefully lead to greater attention being paid to the effective implementation of these directives and to working conditions, with a view to reducing the figure of over 4 million accidents at work per year and over 4 500 deaths and injuries leading to permanent incapacity across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We strongly believe that there needs to be a policy of real improvement in the practices of the various Member States. The Commission must, as a matter of urgency, submit a more thorough report on the current situation regarding workers’ safety and health in the workplace. Furthermore, the International Labour Organisation conventions and other legislation in these areas must be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The Freitas report being put to the vote today concerns the outermost regions and, in particular, Réunion. The outermost regions suffer from geographical and geopolitical constraints that make them more isolated and less able to export their goods to the European continent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Designed as it is to compensate for additional costs, this scheme offers support to local fisheries sectors by processing fishery products and transporting them to, and marketing them on, the European continent. It also helps to increase the competitiveness of local companies and of the fisheries sector at European level. The effectiveness of this scheme can be illustrated by the fact that this compensation has enabled Réunion to increase the volume and value of its exports since 2000.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Renewing this compensation scheme will enable us to continue our efforts to integrate the industrial, longline and coastal fishing sectors of the outermost regions into the internal market. These efforts must be supported by other factors such as the taking into account of the variation in oil prices, because it ought not to be forgotten that the outermost regions rely heavily on oil and that transport costs constrain the export of local goods.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are delighted that the report adopted today has incorporated all of the proposals that were tabled by the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP). These proposals were already contained in the Committee on Regional Development’s opinion, which we drew up.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given their importance, we should like to highlight the following proposals submitted to Parliament by the PCP regarding the increase in the overall budget:</p>
      <p sl="pt">the increase of EUR 2 million in the overall budget from EUR 15 to 17 million, of which EUR 570 000 is earmarked for the Azores and Madeira.</p>
      <p sl="pt">the removal of the 75% compensation limit for transport and other related costs, thereby guaranteeing 100% complete coverage of these costs to continental Europe and for local markets in the outermost regions;</p>
      <p sl="pt">the removal of the expiry date, thus making the compensation scheme permanent, with a five-yearly review;</p>
      <p sl="pt">the local processing industry continues to be permitted to use fish caught by Community vessels where the local fleets’ catch is insufficient to supply that industry;</p>
      <p sl="pt">positive discrimination in favour of traditional, small-scale inshore fishing;</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of the Freitas report, for the following reasons:</p>
      <p sl="pt">1. It takes account of the particular characteristics of the fisheries sector in the outermost regions, by ensuring compensation for additional costs incurred by the economic operators involved in fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">2. The report proposes that the compensation scheme should become permanent, in view of the permanent difficulties faced by the fisheries sector in the outermost regions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">3. It proposes the possibility of supplementing the Community compensation scheme with national aid.</p>
      <p sl="pt">4. It proposes greater flexibility in the financial management of the scheme, by providing for variations in the funds allocated to each region or Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pt">5. It proposes an increase from EUR 15 to 17 million in financial resources, which will fund the compensation scheme every year during the period 2007-2013.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In other words, although the Commission’s proposal was good to begin with, Parliament’s proposals have managed to make substantial improvements, by meeting in full the need to compensate the additional costs involved in fishing in Madeira and the Azores, which will now have an annual overall budget of EUR 5 million for the purpose.</p>

    <intervention id="4-097" speaker_id="4461" name="Luís Queiró" is_mep="True" mode="written">
      <p sl="pt">The completion of the internal market and the gradual removal of trade barriers has helped considerably to boost economies of scale in the outermost regions. However, the natural barriers to trade that remain in these regions put companies located there at a distinct disadvantage compared to those deriving full benefit from access to the Community market. It is these geographical and structural conditions peculiar to the outermost regions that justify the compensation we pay for the additional costs incurred in marketing fisheries products from the outermost regions for the market in continental Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Accordingly, the continuation of the compensation scheme for the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guiana and Réunion into the period 2007-2013 means that we must finally adopt a specific development aid strategy for these regions, in particular in the fisheries sector, by strengthening the partnership. Accordingly, this should be a permanent scheme, with the possibility of a certain degree of flexibility, in view of the specific conditions in these regions and in order to make best use of the scheme.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore vital we lend these measures our wholehearted backing.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am very pleased with Mr Freitas’s report, which takes full account of the additional costs faced by some French overseas departments when they export their fishery products. The interests of Guiana and Réunion, as exporters of these kinds of products, have well and truly been protected. The European Parliament has issued the following four requests, in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, that the initial ceiling on compensation of additional costs, which has been set arbitrarily at 75%, be abolished. On the one hand, this rate is not based on any logical criteria and, on the other, there is no reason why fishery products should not benefit from such a favourable scheme as agricultural products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, that State aid for the production, processing and marketing of fishery products sourced from these regions be possible and that compensation be awarded for imported products, such as salt and oil, that are used during the processing of fishery products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, that recourse to intra-Community imports be permitted, if the catches of the outermost regions’ fleets are not large enough to guarantee the profitability of the processing industries in these regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, that the financial envelope for Guiana and Réunion be increased to EUR 5 518 000.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) were established following the reform of the common fisheries policy adopted in 2002. Council Decision 2004/585/EC defines a general framework for the running of the RACs in order to ensure that they are dealt with in a consistent and balanced manner. The Commission’s proposal, supported in full by Parliament’s rapporteur, is aimed at putting the RACs on a sounder operational basis by improving the conditions under which they are funded.

      <p sl="pt">We support this report, which improves the operating conditions of the Regional Advisory Councils (RACs). Their mainstreaming into the budget means that the Community contribution will no longer be digressive and that they will become subject to a single method of accounting.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The key issue that needs to be addressed, however, is that of the RACs’ long-term financial viability. Given that the RACs are an integral part of the common fisheries policy (CFP), Community funding for their normal operations should be guaranteed on a permanent basis.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report before us applies to funding and not to other aspects of the Council decision such as the number, composition and functioning of the RACs, which will be dealt with in another review of Decision 2004/585/EC. It is difficult at present to carry out an assessment of the RACs given that only four of the seven are operational.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Our support for this proposal is based, however, on a vision of the RACs as an instrument for encouraging the decentralisation of the CFP, for ensuring that the fishermen and their representative bodies are involved in the decision-making process regarding the CFP – which we feel is not completely the case at the moment – and for guaranteeing that the interests of all Member States on the issue of fisheries are fairly represented.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in 2006, 31 000 illegal refugees found their way to the Canary Islands and tried to emigrate from there to the European mainland – six times more than did so the year before. We have seen similar scenes in Southern Italy and Lampedusa.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If the human tragedy of the refugees is to be addressed, it must be done by tackling the hopeless situation in their countries of origin, not by importing transitory social tension.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Accordingly, our group welcomes Frontex and the establishment of intervention brigades in the countries that are facing the problem of mass immigration, on the condition that this new instrument is deployed efficiently and not simply serves as a media spectacle.</p>
      <p sl="nl">External border control falls within the Member States’ remit, but the flows of refugees that are common today illustrate that these external borders have become too permeable. The exponential influx of illegal immigrants can therefore only be addressed by taking additional, but not replacement, measures to support the Member States, which, it is to be hoped, is where Frontex will come in.</p>

Frontex’s rapid intervention teams are desperately needed, certainly in light of the huge shortcomings of various Member States when it comes to protecting external borders.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We will have to wait and see how efficient these teams will prove to be in practice. The entire concept hinges on the willingness of all Member States to meet their Schengen obligations. There is currently far too much apathy, far too much leniency, and mass regularisations of illegal immigrants have put the entire Schengen concept at risk. Even if the Frontex rapid intervention teams work well and efficiently, this will all be in vain if some Member States refuse to face up to their political responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">In this connection, however, we should not forget the other main routes, above all, our external borders with Eastern Europe. In this context, I believe that the resources available under Frontex should be substantially increased. At the same time, we must demonstrate the realities of Europe in the countries of origin of illegal immigrants, so that the dream of a land of milk and honey no longer prompts such acts of desperation and ensures that cooperation with these countries in the area of repatriation, which is indeed largely financed by us, functions more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are opposed to the creation at EU level of what are called Rapid Border Intervention Teams along the borders of the different Member States, as it is indicative of the EU’s repressive, military nature.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This measure forms part of the current trend towards security at all costs and reflects the policy of criminalising immigration, which illustrates a lack of respect for human dignity and for fundamental human rights. These rapid border intervention teams, the walls and the immigrant detention centres are instruments for implementing a Fortress Europe policy, to which we are vehemently opposed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This measure is being justified on the grounds of combating illegal immigration. I wish to highlight the fact that one of the main components of the policy put forward is repression, whilst overlooking the real causes of immigration, namely poverty, hunger, war, the lack of prospects of a decent life for millions and millions of human beings, including Portuguese people, caused by capitalist exploitation and the brutal centralisation of wealth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other hand, given that border protection falls under the competences of a State, we feel that this proposal – despite some safeguards – represents a further step towards creating a European coastguard, which, if it materialised, would constitute an attack on national sovereignty.</p>

Thousands of people die each year in attempting to reach Europe in ways that are unsafe. RABIT is part of the work designed to prevent people from dying in the hands of cynical people-smugglers.

      <p sl="fr">The regulation submitted to us establishes a mechanism that is designed to provide a Member State that is faced with a massive influx of illegal immigrants with assistance, in the form of Rapid Border Intervention Teams, for a limited period of time. This reserve, which consists of 250 to 500 border guards within the European Borders Agency (Frontex), will be made available to those Member States that need it in order to protect their external borders.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that, although the control of the external borders is incumbent on the Member States and comes under the intergovernmental remit, the massive influx of illegal immigrants that occurred, for example, between 15 August and 15 December 2006, when immigrants left the coasts of West Africa for the Canary Islands, showed just how wide open the Union’s external borders were to a rapidly increasing number of immigrants. Cooperation among Member States would therefore seem vital in this area. More than 31 000 illegal immigrants landed in the Canary Islands in 2006, that is to say, six times as many as in the previous year.</p>

It must be emphasised in this connection that the human dignity of the immigrants must be observed and that individuals are not discriminated against on account of their gender, race, ethnic origin, religion or outlook on life, any disability they may have, their age or sexual orientation, nor should the Regulation have a negative impact on the rights of persons seeking protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU as a whole is also defined by its borders. In this context, it is clear that the Union’s external borders are a territory under the exclusive sovereignty of the Member States, but also territories whose integrity, monitoring and protection is in everyone’s interests, given that problems that arise on those borders tend to have ramifications for the other Member States. First and foremost, one thinks of illegal immigration. Yet there is also illegal trafficking and – on a rather different tack but an issue for which the rationale still holds – environmental threats.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is entirely right and extremely important that we share the disproportionate burden carried by the Member States that, due to geographical reasons, have the most vulnerable external borders. Quite apart from being an expression of solidarity among EU Member States, cooperation of this nature arises above all from the need to make border protection as effective as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">These teams will therefore have the task of patrolling the areas surrounding the EU’s external borders under the authority of the national border guards of the host Member State.</p>

      <p sl="sv">We have chosen to vote against the report because we believe that the tonnage redistribution levels proposed by the Commission are adequate. Moreover, we question the need for increased aid for an already over-established sector. The EU already has considerable over-capacity in its fishing fleet, together with limited fisheries resources. The difficulties, discussed in the Council, of checking that the catch capacity does not increase with conversion is therefore one of the reasons why we have chosen not to support an increase in the levels concerned.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In June 2006, after the political agreement reached in the Council on the new European Fisheries Fund, a decision was taken to amend two provisions of the basic regulation on the revised common fisheries policy (2371/2002) applying to the management of fishing fleet capacity. The amendment is aimed at permitting some adaptations of the fleet to improve safety, working conditions and hygiene, product quality on board and energy efficiency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The current proposal, from June 2006, subsequent to the EFF, provides for limited aid for modernising the fleet to improve safety, working conditions and hygiene. It covers energy efficiency, providing for the use of 4% of the tonnage withdrawn with public aid. Furthermore, it states that the reduction in power following the replacement of an engine with public aid may not be restored.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In spite of our reservations regarding the Commission’s proposal, our vote in favour is based on two proposals made by the rapporteur, which are as follows:</p>
      <p sl="pt">the 10% of the tonnage scrapped can be used for modernisation, which, being limited, will allow for prioritising the modernisation of small-scale coastal fishing vessels, that is to say, vessels with an overall length of less than 12 metres;</p>

      <p sl="en">Why I cannot vote in favour of the resolution on the Human Rights Report:</p>
      <p sl="en">1. The report fails to mention social, economic and cultural rights; neither does it call for these rights to be treated as an EU priority. While millions of people worldwide die of hunger, have neither housing nor work and live in deepest poverty, the EU report does not refer to these violations. It reduces human rights to civil liberties only, thereby disregarding the principle of indivisibility of human rights as set forth in the UN Charter;</p>
      <p sl="en">2. The report does not mention human rights violations committed or supported by EU Member States. However, in order to avoid hypocrisy the EU needs to investigate and tackle human rights violations committed with the involvement or support of EU Member states in third countries or against third-country nationals;</p>
      <p sl="en">3. The resolution calls for military intervention in Sudan. This is wrong because the protection of human rights must be through civilian, not military, action. War remains the most severe human rights violation, yet it is not mentioned in the report. No reference is made to the killing of civilians by EU Member State forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU’s role in the world and in particular in its immediate neighbourhood involves its ability to use soft power to increase universal respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">On the other side of that coin, the time has come for us to address seriously the enormous threat to the spread of human rights arising from China’s cooperation strategy and international aid, China being an emerging power in this area.

For this reason, I am not surprised by the bloodthirsty countries that sentence their opponents to death without compunction. I believe that we have a duty, and perhaps the ability, to stop them.

I have spoken about this before and I wish to do so again.</p>
      <p sl="fi">If we are talking here about a real problem, discrimination, which we really must do something about, why on earth do we use the inappropriate word ‘phobia’ in this connection?

Where in the past, debates on homophobia were held on many occasions, these days, it is more about everyone indulging in a bit of Poland-bashing.

      <p sl="de">The PPE-DE Group declares its support for the decisions taken by the European Parliament in relation to homophobia (in particular, the decision of 16 January 2006). In this spirit, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats emphatically rejects any form of homophobia as well as all forms of discrimination, whatever its nature.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, the PPE-DE Group has the utmost confidence in the institutions of the European Union, in particular, the European Commission as the ‘guardian of the treaties’. Given the existing legal position (the anti-discrimination Directive), the Commission will take the necessary steps, as far as there is a need on the part of EU Member States, in order to put a stop to these initiatives which must be rejected in every respect.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the PPE-DE Group wholly supports the appointment of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights to investigate the situation relating to homophobia in Europe and does not wish to take further action before the results of the study are known.</p>
      <p sl="de">Polish society enjoys the wholehearted confidence of the PPE-DE Group in that it will take the appropriate steps against these homophobic trends which have started to appear.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The procedure in Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure specifies that ‘when placing a statement with debate on its agenda, Parliament shall decide whether or not to wind up the debate with a resolution’.

A dialogue of the deaf, then.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This resolution is not a repeat of the interinstitutional debate in which, I might add, only the initiated were able to take part. The procedure can be criticised all the more for the fact that Parliament’s services, which have already been consulted, are refuting the allegations that have been adopted. Poland itself had already responded, on 5 March, on its Prime Minister’s official website, to the fresh accusations being made by Parliament.</p>

The implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the biggest hindrances to economic and social development in the EU and in the least developed Member States that suffer from economic difficulties, such as Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report clearly states the objective of using ‘the economic recovery to cut their budget deficits and by making labour markets more competitive’. The idea, in other words, is to cut the State’s social functions and to deregulate the labour market in terms of salaries and the job security of public administration workers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The primary objective of this report is no longer zero deficit but budgetary excess. Naturally, the rapporteur is not comfortable with the 2005 pseudo review of the Pact, when there is clear evidence of the Pact’s irrationality given the economic recession the EU was experiencing. This, as we all know, is a political pact, the fruit of the prevailing neoliberal ideology, in which economic justification is just an alibi.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, the events of March have dramatically served to underline the fact that the crisis which has long been smouldering in Zimbabwe has escalated. The brutal treatment of peaceful demonstrators and opposition politicians, as well as the threats made against Western ambassadors, show a regime whose ‘rule of law mask’ has finally dropped.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Mugabe is battling to hold on to power using all means at his disposal. Given the deplorable economic situation (I can only recall an unemployment rate of 80% and an inflation rate above 1 700%) and increasing levels of repression, public opinion in the country is openly turning against him more and more. This is now no longer restricted to just the general population. Even his own party, the Zanu-PF party, is no longer fully behind him. His attempt at the party congress in December 2006 to postpone the Presidential elections by two years to coincide with the date of Parliamentary elections in 2010 was referred back to committee, where it failed.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency, we have, over recent weeks, made it quite clear where we stand in relation to events in Zimbabwe. In two statements on 12 and 14 March, the criminalisation of the peaceful ‘Prayers Meeting’, which took place in Harare on 11 March, was condemned, and the release demanded of those persons under arrest, along with a call for legal and medical aid to be granted.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its note dated 13 March 2007, the German embassy in Harare, on behalf of all EU partners, emphatically called on the Zimbabwean Government to observe the principles of the constitution. Coordinating closely between themselves, EU ambassadors in the country expressed to the Zimbabwean Government the fact that they were ready at any time to look after those persons arrested and injured by the government, and were also prepared to do this personally.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency, we condemned in the strongest possible terms in our statement of 18 March the renewed arrests and mistreatment of members of the opposition on 17 and 18 March, as well as the imposition of a ban on leaving the country against two female opposition members seriously injured in the attacks on 11 March who wanted to undergo medical examination in South Africa. Following this, the injured opposition members were able to fly to South Africa. The majority of members of the opposition who had been arrested were released.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the behest of the EU, in its debate on 29 March, the UN Human Rights Council dealt exclusively with Zimbabwe. In a declaration supported by 50 countries in total, the EU made it perfectly clear where it stood in relation to the current situation in Zimbabwe and called on the Mugabe Government to respect law and order, defend human rights and cooperate with the UN’s human rights mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all paying very close attention to the reactions of Zimbabwe’s neighbours. Our embassies in the region are involved in an intensive political dialogue with the governments of their host countries. We all agree in terms of our analysis that there are increasing signs that solidarity with the Mugabe regime is crumbling throughout the region as a whole, not least under the pressure exerted by civil society. In this regard, we are particularly hoping that our African partners will now openly show for the first time how important the solution of the Zimbabwe crisis is to them.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition to individual remarks such as those made by Zambia’s President Mwanawasa when he compared Zimbabwe with the sinking Titanic, the policy change by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has particularly caught our attention. At a special summit on 28 and 29 March 2007, its Heads of Government acknowledged their regional responsibility in the Zimbabwe conflict for the first time. President Mbeki has been provided with a clear mandate to set a dialogue in motion between the government and the opposition. His activities are to be supported by his Tanzanian counterpart, Mr Kikwete, in his capacity as current Chair of the SADC organ on politics, defence and security. The Secretary General of the SADC will present a report on the economic situation in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The principal demands placed on Mugabe by the SADC are to keep to the date set for the Presidential elections in 2008 and to cease repression of the opposition. On 30 March, the central committee of the Zanu-PF party decided to hold Presidential elections in March 2008 and to bring forward the Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for 2010, to 2008 as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mugabe has been chosen as the leading candidate without any internal discussions. At the same time, changes were announced which would forcibly improve the starting position of Mugabe and his party in the run-up to the elections. These include, inter alia , the increase in wards and, consequently, their gerrymandering, the appointment, not through direct elections, of senate members in proportion to the strength of the party in Parliament, and the fact that if the office of President remains vacant, the new President shall be determined by Parliament and not through new elections. These new regulations still have to become law as a result of changes to the constitution.</p>
      <p sl="de">The government has not stopped the use of force against individual members of the opposition. It has branded members of the Tsvangirai wing of the MDC opposition party terrorists and, in so doing, is trying to drive a wedge between the opposition which united for the first time following the March unrest. The State has, however, refrained from prohibiting or breaking up large-scale events such as the ‘Prayers Meeting’ referred to in the country’s two largest cities. The ban on gatherings and demonstrations has also been lifted, except for several areas in Harare.</p>
      <p sl="de">Already by the end of 2006, the party congress of the Zanu-PF party had demonstrated that Mugabe’s position was no longer undisputed. In the meantime, Mugabe has increasingly been developing a siege mentality, which has manifested itself, not least, in the formation of parallel organisations such as the youth militia, which falls outside the military and police hierarchy. Their impressive, even oppressive, presence in front of the central committee’s session building certainly had an impact on the decision-making process of politburo members in favour of Mugabe’s appointment as a Presidential candidate.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite Mugabe’s tactical victory at the central committee meeting on 30 March, which gave him the nomination as a Presidential candidate in 2008 and thereby weakened the position of his critics within the party, the feeling in Zimbabwe is that a sort of apocalyptic mood seems to be holding sway. Therefore, within the EU, in addition to discussions on current developments, thoughts have turned to the post-Mugabe era. Over recent days, both the EU/Africa working group and the EU/Africa Directors have looked into Zimbabwe intensively. Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the crisis in Zimbabwe in detail.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its conclusions, the Council welcomed the SADC initiative and declared its willingness to support it, if called on to do so. It has underlined its view that only a broad, constructive dialogue can form the basis for genuine reform and national reconciliation in Zimbabwe. At the same time, it has stressed that the EU will also implement humanitarian measures in future which will benefit the population directly.</p>
      <p sl="de">In its communiqué following the special summit in March, the SADC called on the EU to put an end to sanctions. In view of the current situation in the country, we will not comply. Our policy must remain credible. Reacting to the unrest which took place in March, and this is something which the Council also decided upon on Monday, we will widen the consolidated list of persons subject to sanctions to include the police officers who are primarily responsible for the current crisis and the human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is agreement between the EU partners that a solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe can only be achieved with African help. Following their political about-turn in March, our African partners expressly called on the EU to be patient. We will continue to monitor closely, however, whether, and to what extent, the SADC policy which is being striven for is acquiring some sort of shape.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are conscious of the fact, however, that we cannot sit back indefinitely. In the foreseeable future, the EU will have to adopt a stance in relation to the SADC initiative in terms of its content. We will also react with the necessary vigour to events in the country. The EU cannot, and will not, remain silent on human rights violations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission is very concerned about the current deterioration of the political and socio-economic situation in Zimbabwe. In particular, we condemn the recent acts of violent repression against the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also fully supported the statements issued by the German Presidency condemning the recent violence, arrests and mistreatment of detainees. The Government of Zimbabwe was also called upon to release those detainees and to respect fundamental rights. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue with all political forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last Monday, the General Affairs Council also issued conclusions to this effect. In this context, the Commission continues to attach great importance to enhanced dialogue with Zimbabwe’s regional peers. We fully acknowledge the major role they can play in promoting national reconciliation in this country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission therefore welcomed the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which took place on 28 and 29 March 2007 in Dar es Salaam. The regional leaders decided to engage in the resolution of the Zimbabwe crisis by appointing the South African President, Thabo Mbeki, as a mediator. It was agreed with all the European Member States that a high-level message would be delivered to SADC on the subject. Firstly, to recognise the major role the organisation can play in the resolution of the crisis and, secondly, to give SADC real breathing space in its mediation efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">We feel, therefore, that nothing should be done to jeopardise the SADC initiative and that the EU should be seen to be ready to follow SADC efforts to resolve the Zimbabwean crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">Furthermore, it was agreed to make an effort to properly inform the region and Africa at large of the content of EU measures, or sanctions, regarding Zimbabwe. They consist of a visa ban for the Zimbabwean leadership and the freezing of their assets, in addition to an arms embargo. Trade, economic and essential aid cooperation has not been affected by the EU measures. In this sense, the level of aid committed to Zimbabwe in 2006 alone was around EUR 193 million: EUR 86 million by the Commission and EUR 107 million by Member States. This kind of assistance, for the direct benefit of the Zimbabwean population, is due to be continued.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their statements. Every Member of this House will be aware of the appalling situation in Zimbabwe. We have expressed our views in some 16 resolutions in recent years, but the Mugabe regime persistently reminds us that no matter how bad the situation, it can always make matters tragically worse.</p>
      <p sl="de">Millions have fled the country; many of those who remain are on food aid; hyper-inflation is expected to reach 5000% by the end of this year; unemployment stands at 80%; 3000 people a week die from HIV-AIDS; and Zimbabwe has the world’s highest orphan rate. Those are the grim statistics. When people try to gather or make any sort of protest, they are, as we have seen, brutally attacked by the regime’s police.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree that there has been one positive development: Mugabe’s latest brutalities have at last provoked a response from neighbouring African countries. This must be encouraged. The Southern African Development Community has finally recognised that a crisis exists in Zimbabwe. That is a very significant development. It is further evidence that opinion across Africa is shifting. Mugabe is now seen by his peers as a dictator who has selfishly abused his own people and whose actions threaten wider economic development across the whole continent. They no longer accept Mugabe’s tired excuse that Zimbabwe’s problems came from outside.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear for all to see that it is Mugabe who has brought his country and its people to their knees. He went into the SADC summit expecting endorsement of his policies, but instead left with a flea in his ear and the appointment of South African President Mbeki as facilitator of the dialogue between Zanu-PF and the opposition. Mbeki’s task will be to create conditions for free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, until freedom is restored to Zimbabwe there must be no let-up on the pressure on the regime. All too often, European governments have on spurious grounds failed even to apply the EU’s own travel ban and other restrictive measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">When Mugabe finally falls from power, the international community must be ready to act without delay. I call upon the Commission and the Council to begin serious planning now for a massive, comprehensive and urgent programme of assistance to Zimbabwe for the post-Mugabe era.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the Zimbabwe that I knew was a proud country, leading in the region, proud of its hard-earned freedom, a beautiful country, where black and white Zimbabweans believed in the future, where black and white together tried to heal the painful wounds of the Rhodesia era’s racism, a country where citizens worked at building a democracy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is in stark contrast with the Zimbabwe of today, with its appalling statistics. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is currently one of the world’s lowest: 37 for men and not more than 34 for women; 80% of the Zimbabweans are living below the poverty line; one third of the population have fled the country, with millions of people having sought refuge in neighbouring countries, and 50 000 more refugees being added to their number every month.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The economy of the country that was once known as Africa’s grain basket, has plunged by 40% in one decade, and there is no improvement in sight. The Zimbabwean economy is still shrinking by 5.7%, which makes Zimbabwe the only country in Africa whose economy is not growing. The hyperinflation, to which reference has already been made, means it is impossible for the many Zimbabweans who stayed in Zimbabwe, with its mass unemployment, to meet their daily basic needs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Union was right to decide to penalise with even more extensive personal sanctions the Zimbabwean leaders, who, with their state terror, have brought about this level of devastation. As we all know, there is a great deal more needed to find a way-out. This way-out is described in our joint resolution. It outlines how the country might go forward into a post-Mugabe era, describes concrete steps and measures, and, rightly, makes a dramatic call on Mbeki and the SADC members to block the door to state terror, with as heavy a hand as necessary, and to clear the path for dialogue in the post-Mugabe era.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We are behind the broadest possible opposition to Mugabe and in favour of Zimbabwe. We would ask the Council to extend the scope of the sanctions. Anyone who is responsible for this ever steeper downward spiral in this country that was once so proud must be called to account, including ministers, representatives, army leaders, the police and the secret service, as well as the governor of the central bank. We would ask the United Kingdom to use its presidency in the Security Council to add Zimbabwe to the agenda. Finally, we really do hope that Mbeki, playing an even bigger role, will bring the Mugabe regime to an end, for, after nearly three decades, it is time for it to be done away with for good.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, if a specific country is often mentioned in Parliament it is a bad sign, as it means that the human rights situation in that country must be serious. We are afraid that, in the foreseeable future, Zimbabwe was, is and will remain precisely such a country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The paradox lies in the fact that we are celebrating the 27th anniversary of this country’s independence. Unfortunately, this independence does not involve freedom. For example, one and a half months ago, the opposition was brutally crushed. Two people were killed and 300 were arrested.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is the political side of the situation, which we frequently most like to discuss in Parliament. However, there is also an economic side to the problem which is perhaps even more serious. In Zimbabwe, nearly 4.5 million people are malnourished, one third of whom have been helped by the World Food Programme, and have received food as part of that programme. This is a country where the average life expectancy is 35.5 years. As the previous speaker mentioned, Zimbabwe is one of the world record holders (in negative terms) in this respect. One fifth of its population is infected with HIV, and there 3 200 new cases every week. Zimbabwe has the highest rate of orphans in the world. The unemployment rate in this country stands at 80%! Eighty per cent of the population also live below the poverty line! Every month, a few thousand people flee the country. Over 30% of its citizens have already emigrated to neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Zimbabwe is the only African country in which the economy is in decline. During the last decade, economic turnover in this country fell by 40%, and this year it fell by almost another 6%. Last year, the average rate of inflation rose to 2 200%. This year, it will no doubt exceed 5 000%! Since 1998, agricultural production has fallen by four fifths! Zimbabwe's two main industries, namely tobacco and gold mining are teetering on the brink of collapse.</p>
      <p sl="pl">These are all just statistics and, tragic and telling though they may be, I am afraid that dry figures, percentages and numbers may obscure the individual tragedies faced by millions of people. Zimbabwe may be far away, but let us remember the words of Ernest Hemingway: ‘Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.’ Zimbabwe is a country which has fallen into a ‘black hole’. It is disappearing before our eyes, it is ceasing to exist economically and socially, and the only sign of a functioning government is political repression. We cannot remain silent. We cannot pretend that sympathy, without any political decisions, will be enough.</p>
      <p sl="pl">That is why we need this debate; that is why we need this resolution. We need a joint resolution, a resolution that is above political divisions.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, it sounds rather ironic and tragic when those who made Zimbabwe a colony, those who plundered its natural resources all these years, are today fighting for its independence and freedom. Why does the European Parliament keep addressing the subject of Zimbabwe? Is it because human rights are being infringed? No, ladies and gentlemen. Let us call a spade a spade. It is because Great Britain dreams of making it a colony once again and because the other large countries in the European Union are again dreaming of new colonies on the African continent. These are the facts. Zimbabwe acquired its independence through a hard and bloody fight against the British colonists.</p>
      <p sl="el">Are there problems? Of course there are. Is the situation as it is described? Of course it is, but it is the result of years of colonialism, it is the result of the measures imposed all these years by the European Union and other imperialist countries, measures designed to achieve an economic stranglehold on and the political isolation of the Zimbabwe regime. In the final analysis, if and how the situation changes in Zimbabwe is a matter for its people and neither the European Union nor anyone else is entitled to interfere in its internal affairs.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today there is a plan which has been developing for many years. What is this plan? To fund and buy out the opposition. Millions are being given to various persons who stand as political opponents to the regime. Non-governmental organisations are being funded that consist of paid employees who stand for nothing in the community in Zimbabwe. There are sanctions and, at the same time, Great Britain does not keep to the agreements it has made with Zimbabwe. Even the illegal arms trade continued and Margaret Thatcher's son was arrested and that is a known fact and was reported in all the newspapers.</p>
      <p sl="el">We therefore consider that the European Union has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe or any other country. Any problems there may need to be resolved by the people themselves as they so choose. That is why we voted against the joint motion for a resolution and we are saddened by the fact that, although you know that all the measures you take and the embargo you impose on Zimbabwe makes things worse and causes thousands of people to die, you continue with the same barbaric policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Mr Mugabe and mouse hunters. Is there a connection between Zimbabwe’s President and these people indulging in this rather curious pursuit? Very much so, because in the immediate vicinity of Mugabe's estate – Africa’s largest private residence – respectable citizens keep their heads above water by hunting mice on a daily basis. Indeed, these animals are, according to them, like beef to us. This is how deep Zimbabwe, up to recently Africa’s grain basket, has sunk under Robert Mugabe’s tyrannical regime.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This regime is founded on a campaign that is absurd and criminal in equal measure, as a result of which since 2000, thousands of productive farms have been confiscated from their white owners and handed over to Mugabe’s incompetent and indifferent figureheads, resulting in a large-scale famine. By the way, Mugabe's Zanu-PF Party uses the food shortage as a weapon against the opposition. The correspondent R.W. Johnson recently levelled ultimate criticism of Mugabe's tyranny. He reported that in Zimbabwe, people are eliminated on a mass-scale like animals and that most casualties are the direct result of intentional government policy. This genocide is probably ten times worse than that in Darfur, yet it is ignored by the UN.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Arnold Tsunga, chairman of the human rights organisation Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, used identical words to describe the situation. Tsunga called Mugabe’s policy ‘cunning genocide’, because it is not being noticed by governments, aid organisations or the press. My message to the Council, the Commission, and to this House, is that this indictment of cunning, implicit genocide should never give us one moment's peace until such time as it can be withdrawn.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Pafilis, four minutes ago, you gave the most cynical speech on Zimbabwe which has been heard in this House since 1999. You will actually stop at nothing and are legitimising a dictatorship. I recommend that you again take to heart the moving appeal given by Bishop Tutu, for I consider him to be above suspicion.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is sometimes believed that it is impossible to sink any lower in a country if it has the lowest life expectancy worldwide, has the highest rate of inflation across the globe, if unemployment is running at 80%, if just as many people are living below the absolute poverty level, and if the economy has shrunk by 40% over the last decade. Unfortunately, the power of the regimes in these very countries is still sufficient to hit out at the population, as happened most recently on 11 March. Many were arrested and tortured. As members of Parliament, we are particularly horrified by the brutal mistreatment of our colleague, Nelson Chamisa, who, en route to Brussels for a committee meeting of our Joint Parliamentary Assembly, was brutally beaten up at Harare airport by regime thugs, losing an eye in the process.</p>
      <p sl="de">My thanks go to the Council which clearly expressed its views on the Council situation on 13 and 18 March and in the General Council as well on 23 April, and also expanded the list of travel bans imposed on leading supporters of the regime. At least the SADC has recognised that there is a crisis in Zimbabwe and has employed President Mbeki as a mediator. We are aware that unfortunately, Mugabe feels somewhat encouraged following the SADC meeting and repression is also continuing throughout the whole of the country without the international community paying any attention.</p>
      <p sl="de">South Africa always plays a key role. President Mbeki must play the role of mediator in a credible fashion. We know how difficult it is to accept that a liberator can evolve into a tyrant, but it is in Mbeki’s hands to go down in the annals of history as someone who, in the end, has also helped human rights and democracy in Africa on the road to success by taking the side of the long-suffering people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">‘Mugabe is mad for power and he will cling to it, even if it means destroying the economy and destroying Zimbabwe. Mugabe is an evil man, a bully and a murderer. I will not be bullied or bought by him. I accept that it may mean that I lose my life.’</p>
      <p sl="pt">Are the opposition leaders, human rights activists, those campaigning for Zimbabwe’s development and this courageous archbishop receiving proper support from the Commission and the Council? That support implies mobilising the necessary solidarity from other Africans of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community. In the name of serious debate on Africa’s problems and of positive interaction between Europe and Africa, will they too be invited and made welcome in Lisbon on the occasion of the EU-Africa summit during the Portuguese Presidency?</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Parliament resolution is important and timely in order for us to have clear answers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am in total agreement with what Mr Gahler said with regard to Mr Pafilis. I have never heard such perversion of the truth in my life as what he just said in this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, I welcome the joint motion that seeks strongly to uphold the sanctions against the ruthless violence of the regime that is plaguing Zimbabwe in the worst possible way. I thank those who have worked hard on this motion for a resolution, and I am pleased with the result.</p>
      <p sl="en">Isolating Mugabe and other members of his regime is of the utmost importance in showing both the international community and the other African nations that the European Union Member States will not tolerate these blatant abuses of human rights and dignity. We have consistently opposed this brutal menace and will continue to do so together. Mugabe should remember his promise to step down and do so now. This is the only action that he could take to benefit Zimbabwe. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
      <p sl="en">Members of Zimbabwe’s illegitimate government are not allowed to enter any EU Member State and I refer, in particular, to the EU-Africa Summit scheduled to be held in Lisbon in December. The joint motion for a resolution makes clear and reasserts that this move would seriously undermine the European Union’s resolve. It would hamper the future use of soft power wherever we might need it. The European Union sanctions in place put real pressure on Mugabe’s brutal regime. As such, they need to be reinforced, strengthened and taken to the next level.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the next level, it is well known that Mugabe is seeking financial backing and support from countries, such as China, that are not always as firm on issues of freedom and democracy as I and many others would like. This joint motion shows Parliament’s determination to take this issue to the UN Security Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the money that we give to Zimbabwe must be spent in the proper way and must not swell the dictator’s coffers.</p>
      <p sl="en">I end by stating very clearly that we are for the Zimbabwean people but we are not in any way for Mr Mugabe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we were all impressed by the fight for independence of the people of Zimbabwe twenty-seven years ago. At that time, Zimbabwean society was seen as an example of colonial struggle by other developing world countries. This respect for the people of Zimbabwe now provides the main moral imperative to support the fight for democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Exactly a month ago, during the plenary session of the European Parliament, we saw the bloodied face of the democratic opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, on the television screens in this building. He is now the true leader of Zimbabwean society.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Now, the oppressed leaders of the student movement, civil society, the trade unions, the European Union, the institutions and the European Parliament all have to do everything they can to help the people of Zimbabwe, to help civil society in that country and to help Zimbabwe return to democracy, freedom and the rule of law. The Republic of South Africa and its president, Mr Mbeki, have a particularly important role to play in this process. The European Parliament supports all actions to foster democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">When addressing the European Parliament, Russian Duma delegates state they profess the same values as the European Union. However, Russia is not about to listen to anyone's advice on how to deal with domestic matters.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The brutality against peaceful demonstrations by residents in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod expose the Russian Government's intolerance and fear of independent thinkers, especially as the presidential elections of 2008 approach.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As soon as Russia experienced the political and economic power of its energy supply ‘weapon’, it ceased to pay any attention to international public opinion and the signals it sends about breaches of human rights in the country. Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union, and for the sake of energy policy we apply a double standard: one for Russia and another for the rest of the world.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is a good thing that we have managed, in this House, to draw up a compromise version of the resolution on human rights infringements in Russia, as it is important for the European Parliament to have a united position and to address both Russian society and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, with one voice. In the sad days following the loss of the first democratic Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, it is especially important for all those who have been rooting for democracy in Russia and for whom a democratic Russia ought to be an important partner for Europe, to now acknowledge that the Russia of today has not fulfilled all the dreams which we shared when Boris Yeltsin appeared on the political stage in that country. Unfortunately, these hopes have remained unfulfilled. We have to acknowledge this fact and that is what our resolution expresses. I would like to once again point out that I am pleased that the resolution is the result of a compromise between many, diverse political groups.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have to say that, for me, the images shown on television of how the demonstrations held by human rights campaigners in Russia were repressed, were indeed traumatic, as they also reminded me of the worst times in my country when street protests were brutally crushed by the police. I would like to point out that, surprisingly, the Russian Human Rights Ombudsman shares this assessment of the brutality of the Russian police. That is why our declaration contains an appeal to the Russian Duma and to our colleagues, namely Russian Members of Parliament, to set up a special committee to deal with this issue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In appealing to you, Members of this House, to adopt this resolution, I would like to also appeal to the Russian citizens, who sadly currently do not have access to real information, to be aware that our actions are not a sign of Russophobia, as the Kremlin's propaganda often claims. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. Our actions, our struggle to defend human rights in Russia, to bring democracy back to Russia stem from our deep feelings of friendship towards this country and our deep respect for great Russian literature and for Russia as a great nation. We want that nation to enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy in the European Union and I would like the European Parliament to be an institution that is like a beacon of light for Russians, illuminating the path to democracy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, this week, the European Parliament has dealt with Russia on several occasions, in the sub-committee on human rights with Commissioner Piebalgs, at a joint meeting of the Delegation for relations with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, and now here in plenary, because the problems are becoming more and more acute. We have observed the massive human rights violations in Moscow and St. Petersburg with dismay, where peaceful demonstrations against the authoritarian bias of the system were suppressed by violent intervention by the police, with attacks made against passers-by who were not involved and western journalists.</p>
      <p sl="de">The intimidation and suppression of the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of the press in Russia has become systematic. We are familiar with this type of disinformation and lies from the war in Chechnya. Many media are under government control or operate self-censorship. Independent journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya were murdered. With 13 journalist murders during Putin’s time in office alone, Russia occupies third place after Iraq and Algeria – an alarming result.</p>
      <p sl="de">The political opposition cannot find any mouthpiece. The freedom of the press and freedom of speech are under immense threat. Potential political opponents of Putin, such as Chodorkovsky and Lebedev are sitting in prison without a fair trial and Gary Kasparov was arrested repeatedly. Non-governmental organisations are harassed by means of laws which curtail the rights of civil society. The Russian leadership is not only using its courts but the entire security apparatus as well in the meantime in order to intimidate political opponents. The powers that be in the Kremlin are hitting out. As a result, progress towards the rule of law and an independent justice system are also under threat. It is a perfidious strategy to brand people who are calling for genuine democracy in the country as extremists so as to take away their credibility. Putin is not a flawless democrat. He comes from the KGB and his origins leave their mark.</p>
      <p sl="de">Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the United Nations, yet it violates basic fundamental and human rights. The EU is negotiating a new partnership agreement. This agreement must contain a section on human rights which is also a constituent part of all agreements and treaties. We are showing our solidarity with our friends in Russia who are fighting for a peaceful and democratic future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the clampdown on peaceful demonstrators some weeks ago sends an alarming message about the future of basic freedoms in Russia: freedoms of speech, the media and demonstrations. The Russian Government committed itself to guaranteeing these freedoms as a condition for being admitted to the Council of Europe in 1996. Today, 11 years later, the majority of people in Russia feel insecure and have no trust in law and justice. Sixty-five per cent claim to be unhappy, and more than half disapprove of the Government, which is already heading beyond mere authoritarianism, as one opposition leader put it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We expect the Russian Government to react to this resolution, which is a unanimous expression of serious but friendly concern. We also expect the European Council and Commission to make it absolutely clear at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit that restoration of these basic freedoms will be a crucial test of Russia’s ability and willingness to be a credible international partner.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this point, Russia has become essentially an authoritarian state. EU leaders will share responsibility for the further worsening of the situation there if they are not willing or able to face these new realities with determination and clarity. Speaking with one voice, on the basis of European values, is the only way to help Russia back to the road of democracy. It is vital that Russian citizens should enjoy the same freedoms – including freedom from fear and police violence – that we have been enjoying.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, for a long time, the countries of the old European Communities laboured under the illusion that the authoritarian one-party state and the violent oppression of any form of organised opposition in Russia were a product of Communism. I remember that the German radical student leader Rudi Dutschke, who has been dead for a long time now and was nick-named the Bürgerschreck, warned the Left in Western Europe against this position. In his view, what happened in Russia at the time was completely unrelated to Socialism or Communism, but very much related to what he referred to as an ‘Asian’ tradition. This is a tradition in which a small group, using the toughest measures, manages to remain in charge in a large and sparsely populated country.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Every time someone in Russia is put in power who wishes to resolve this unsatisfactory situation, there has, to date, been every chance that his successor would have resorted to the old abuses. Khrushchev in the 50s and 60s, and Gorbachev in the 80s and 90s failed to change Russia from the top down.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The current President, Putin, like the tsars and Stalin previously, seamlessly fits into this old Russian mould. He managed to gain power when his chaotic predecessor, Yeltsin, was no longer able to run the country, and, having gained popularity among the Russians by destroying Chechnya, is now in the process of taking away their democracy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunate is the country that owns oil or natural gas, because the possession of them, and of the wealth that exports bring in, puts the leaders in a stronger position of power and makes domestic change virtually impossible. Moreover, the criticism levelled by most of the outside world that wants to buy energy will quickly subside. Russia now finds itself in the same position as Saudi Arabia or Iran. Even in the two largest cities, which, so far, offered the most scope for criticism and diversity, demonstrations by opponents are made impossible. The European countries and their residents should not accept this lying down, but should act in solidarity with those who want to turn Russia into a decent democracy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the need to develop relations between the European Union and Russia and the creation of a new dynamic strategic partnership, as required under the geo-economic and geo-strategic circumstances, cannot lessen or negate our criticism about the continuing infringements of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia. I understand and comprehend the European Union's 'Realpolitik' vis-à-vis Russia; at the same time, however, we also need to defend the basic principles of our collective European democratic civilisation. From this point of view, I consider it necessary for the question of human rights to be placed high on the European Union's agenda and within the framework of reinforced political dialogue with Russia and its political leadership. A first opportunity will be the summit on 17 May and the meeting with President Putin.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I should like to comment on something else. It would be a serious political mistake for the European Union to equate human rights in Russia and the situation that prevails there with just certain circles which are openly funded by specific Russian political refugees within the known clique of oligarchs. The recent statements by Mr Berezovsky in London are typical of the intentions of certain circles.</p>

      <p sl="de">However, Russia also has its shady side. The measures currently being taken by the Russian Government against human rights and fundamental freedoms are casting very dark shadows. To act against its own citizens in the manner it did on 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg is unworthy of a genuine member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the cornerstones of a democratic State. The peoples of Europe, including the citizens of Russia, paid for these rights with their blood.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my admiration for the great Russian leader, Boris Yeltsin. He is one of the people we have to thank for the triumph of democracy over dictatorship in the second half of the twentieth century. Yeltsin represented the real Russia, a Russia that fosters civil society, a democratic Russia, a Russia which upholds the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This week, in Strasbourg, there was a special meeting of the Subcommittee on Human Rights in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, during which we carefully interviewed witnesses regarding what is happening in Russia at the moment. All agreed that Russia is heading in a dangerous direction. The careful monitoring of the upcoming elections to the Duma in December of this year and the presidential elections next year are currently most important to the European Parliament. On our part, we have to do everything we can to bring civil society in Russia closer to democracy, to help these institutions ensure that the elections are truly free, fair and that the results not falsified.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, very sad events are taking place in Russia. Attempts to bring democracy to Russia are being suppressed, as are demonstrations and freedom of speech. However, we must be aware of the fact that Russia does not have a tradition of democracy and that those, such as Alexander I, who wanted to bring democracy to Russia in the past, have had to give up or have been widely criticised, as was the case with Boris Yeltsin, as he passed away. We have to be aware of the fact that, according to surveys, more Russians want order than democracy. This is why, when we support everything that is positive in Russia and which brings hope, we have to be aware that, in dealing with the Russian Government, we are drawing up agreements with a government which has a different set of values to Europe. Russia does not have, and has no experience of democracy at home. Neither does it have any experience of normal, civilised behaviour in terms of external relations. This should serve as a warning to all those who want to build a future for Europe on the hope that Russia will show solidarity and be a good partner.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Unfortunately, these accusations could be levelled at all powers today, both from the East and the West, who usurp the right to dominate the world, who want to be global judges, policemen and moral watchdogs. Accusing Russia of anti-democratic practices and human rights infringements today could be described as ‘the pot calling the kettle black’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The harassment of political opponents, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as measures that make it difficult for people to practice their religion – these are all part of everyday political life in many parts of the world, although it is often disguised by lies reported by the media.

In the meantime, there has been a massive relapse. Russia is an authoritarian state with an increasingly aggressive foreign policy. I believe we should emphasise with the utmost clarity that fish always start to stink from the head. The use of OMON militia against demonstrators and foreign journalists such as the German television correspondents would not have been possible without explicit instructions from the Kremlin. We must be clear on the fact that President Putin should bear overall responsibility for repressing the first tentative shoots of democracy and freedom in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need clear language here and should not simply talk about slip-ups. Putin is responsible; the Russian leadership is responsible.

      <p sl="lt">In recent years Russia has become economically stronger, and opinion surveys show a result favourable to the present régime. Therefore, it is particularly difficult to understand the Russian Government's actions aimed at the opposition in the middle of April.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Being unable to make themselves heard in the mass media, opposition parties and non-governmental organisations have attempted to draw attention to breaches of democracy in Russia. The inappropriate reaction to demonstrations of just a few thousand people, as well as the actions of the militia and OMON, reduce the already faltering authority of Russia in the West and complicate the forthcoming negotiations for a new treaty between the EU and Russia.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Only a few officials in Moscow dare to admit that the actions of the power structures have exceeded permissible limits.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, honourable Members, first of all, I would like to express my thanks for having the opportunity to participate in the debate for the second time and take the floor as the German spokesperson on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all watched the events of 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg with a great deal of anxiety. Quite a few of us wonder whether, in view of these developments, the freedom of assembly in Russia is in jeopardy. The Russian Constitution guarantees Russian citizens the right to assemble peacefully, without bearing arms, in order to hold rallies and demonstrations, parades and pickets.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is obviously contrary to the manner in which the Russian authorities acted recently against demonstrators in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Gary Kasparov reported these actions to me in a personal telephone call. It also needs to be borne in mind that the demonstrations of 14 and 15 April differed from previous marches in that the militia acted in a more hard-line manner and that, on this occasion, accredited journalists were detained temporarily as well as attacked.</p>
      <p sl="de">The reporting carried out by several newspapers after the incidents was thoroughly critical. Kommersant talked about ‘Making mincemeat of those who disagreed’ and Moskovskiy Komsomolets about ‘All power to OMON’, while Novaya Izvestiya talked about ‘A besieged fortress and unprecedented toughness’.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there were also reports in which events were played down. A similar picture could be seen in the reaction of the Russian Government. While some government offices defended the action, the spokesperson on human rights, for example, Mr Lukin, conceded that the police had substantially exceeded their authority. The Governor of St. Petersburg, Mr Matvienko, ordered all complaints regarding attacks by Russian police units to be investigated. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, adviser to the Russian President on EU issues, made the same demand, while Ella Pamfilova, Chair of the commission, pointed out that the actions of the militia had damaged Russia’s standing worldwide.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Federal German Government also reacted to these events and, on 16 April, publicly expressed its anxiety in a statement given by the EU Council Presidency. In addition, Germany’s Deputy Government spokesperson, Mr Thomas Steg, declared in Berlin on 16 April that the excessive use of force at the weekend was cause for concern. The action taken against journalists was also unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Federal German Government is awaiting a full account of events from the Russian authorities. Following the incidents in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the German embassy in Moscow immediately lodged a complaint at a high level and requested an immediate and full explanation. We will naturally also speak to the Russian authorities with a certain degree of vigour concerning the situation regarding the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly at the forthcoming human rights consultations between the EU and Russia which are scheduled for 3 May.</p>
      <p sl="de">The development of the human rights situation in Russia must continue to be followed very attentively. This especially applies to the freedom of speech and assembly and free and fair access to the media. As a member of the United Nations, including its role as a member of the new Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Russia is obligated to respect fundamental rights. Respect for these fundamental rights is also of the utmost importance in view of the forthcoming elections in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="de">We will make it clear to Russia that it is in the country’s own interests to do everything possible to ensure that the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly are strengthened and not weakened further.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that a substantial part of the values and human rights on which Europe is founded have been established by Russian intellectuals and artists. We should remind ourselves of this fact and ensure that we continue to tread along this path and not a different one.</p>

This has resonated among his audience, 50 000 of whom have this week signed the online petition asking for his release.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our first thoughts are, of course, with Graham and Margaret Johnston and with the other members of his family, to whom we send our sympathy and support.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all the BBC management and staff and to journalists, trade unions in Britain and worldwide who have led the campaign for Alan’s release.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the colleagues here today told me that Alan is known quite simply as someone who brings stories to life. Today his life is our story. Alan Johnston’s courageous presence, as the only permanently-based Western journalist in Gaza, has precisely enabled him to report the suffering of the Palestinian people, and now he has become the ultimate case of a journalist caught up in his own story – a victim of the suffering itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are told that Alan remains alive and secure, but not who is holding him. We can speculate whether his abduction was for reasons of politics, money or recognition, but we do not know which, if any. We can recognise that to prevent what has happened to Alan from happening to others requires a political understanding and solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, today our response is not political – it is humanitarian, to say to whoever is listening: release Alan Johnston without harm and without hindrance. The European Parliament should welcome the assurances of help made by Europe’s Foreign Ministers this week and of ‘permanent contact’ promised by our own High Representative. We are sure you will act on these promises. I understand too that Commissioner Almunia, responding to today’s debate, will pledge that his colleague Mr Michel will this weekend press Alan Johnston’s case with President Abbas and representatives of the Palestinian Authority. We thank you.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament acknowledges the support and cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and we are proud of Europe’s support to sustain your staff and the vital services they provide, but it is your intelligence services who have been able to make contact with those who have abducted Alan, and it is in you that we place our hopes for a breakthrough.</p>
      <p sl="en">In radio circles, they say that the biggest crime is to say nothing into the microphone. Alan Johnston’s kidnapping is the radio silence that now must come to an end.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, there are reporters who carry out their duties to a more or less satisfactory extent, just as there are better and worse media. Alan Johnston was a good journalist, working for a well-known, popular and respected medium, namely the BBC. Alan Johnston was kidnapped, in spite or because of the fact that he specifically wanted to work for and among the people of the Middle East, an area currently facing crisis. He worked for these people as he informed the world of their situation and, by providing us with information, allowed us politicians to also attempt to resolve the crisis, a crisis over which we sadly have very little influence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, kidnappings, terrorism and murder are sadly all phenomena that are part of today's world, a world where there are no principles left, not even – if one may describe it thus – the principles of warfare. These wars are being fought in the most base manner. Alan Johnston fell victim to this phenomenon. To a certain extent, we are all victims. I hope that the relevant authorities will do everything possible to free Alan Johnston.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there is no doubt that Palestinians in Gaza are suffering greatly through the gross violation of their human rights by the dreadful siege situation imposed on them by the aggressive Israeli Government actions and the tolerance shown for such actions by Western governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, there is no doubt that the daily plight of the Palestinian people is brought to public attention worldwide through the work of journalists. These journalists risk their lives in order to serve the cause of freedom of information and consequently assist in promoting the Palestinian people’s fight for justice. The kidnapping of journalists such as Alan Johnston is, therefore, against the interests of the Palestinian people and is severely damaging their just demands. We call upon the Palestinian people to redouble their efforts to secure the release of Alan Johnston. We believe that in so doing they will be helping themselves most of all.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Gaza is a small, but very urbanised area, virtually cut off from the outside world. Opposition from the neighbouring Israel has meant that the port and airport that had been planned with EU funds have not come into being, any more than has the open link with the much larger part of the future Palestinian state along the river Jordan. Israel was, for a long time, a place that offered employment, but it has largely taken this option away for fear of attacks, and admits far fewer people into the country via the border post of Erez.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Israel also controls the border crossing with Egypt. In this isolated area, a large section of the Palestinian population live like sardines, with no job, with no income and with no adequate housing. The wise decision to remove the Israeli colonist villages from this coastal strip may have done something for those who had lived in them and who were hated by those around them, but hardly anything for anyone else there.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Gaza is a disaster area full of people without any future to look forward to, and that makes it a sort of prison or breeding ground for acts of despair. For a long time, these acts of despair mainly consisted of suicide attacks against Israeli targets, but they also include kidnappings. Alan Johnston is the fifteenth journalist to be kidnapped in Gaza and in the month following his kidnap, nothing was heard about him for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">All Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and the PLO’s imprisoned party leader, Marwan Barghouti, unanimously condemn heinous acts of this kind. A lack of convincing success stories on the path to a state of their own and to provisions and income for their people has meant that they are losing control over events. Without any prospects for the future, unknown criminals are taking over power. This does not do anything to make the situation in Palestine or Israel any better. Journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, are less and less able to follow events on the ground. This is why we must be vigilant, and this is why the kidnapped journalists must be freed.</p>

      <p sl="sv">My thoughts go out to his immediate and extended family and to his colleagues, and I have to say that I have high hopes of his being released. We know that Palestinian leaders condemn the kidnapping and that the kidnappers do not have the support of the Palestinian people.

Armed with these factors, we too can help bring about his release.</p>

However, it is by ensuring the presence of as many journalists as possible there and making sure that as many journalists as possible write about what is happening that those in Gaza have the best chance of getting us all to help improve the situation of the people. Because the Palestinian people know that the kidnapping in question is contrary to their interests, I am certain that the kidnappers will not receive any support and that they will, in the end, have to release Alan Johnston.</p>

Yet another journalist who had the courage to work in difficult and dangerous conditions has fallen victim to kidnappers, thereby also depriving us of the information which we politicians and international public opinion can get about the tragic conditions that prevail in the area.</p>
      <p sl="el">I trust that the fact that this has galvanised public opinion and the political leadership in the Palestinian territories and the efficacy of the National Unity Government, which is becoming more visible day by day, will help to bring about the release of the journalist Alan Johnston, identify those responsible and apportion responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I hope this debate and resolution will add, in some small way, to the international pressure to successfully achieve the release of Alan Johnston following his abduction two weeks ago.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in this Parliament must speak out strongly to send a clear message of condemnation of the acts of violence that have taken place and the kidnapping of a man who has gained a reputation as one of the world’s leading media broadcasters. He has built up a reputation over many years – but in particular during the last three years in Gaza – as a broadcaster who is objective and balanced in his reporting of a very difficult situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">We call on everybody who has any influence or power over his captors to do all they can to secure his release. For the Palestinian people themselves, this crisis is adding to an already tragic situation. It is sending out a message to the rest of the world that not even experienced journalists are welcome or safe in Gaza.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is a man who has been informing the rest of the world of the suffering, injustice and tragedy that continues there. Targeting him by kidnapping him is not only an appalling crime in itself, but it is self-defeating in terms of the Palestinian people’s cause.</p>
      <p sl="de">Gaza is isolated enough without cutting off accurate media reporting. We are calling on the Palestinian Authority in particular to work for his release as an absolute priority and on the Council and Commission to maximise their efforts to that end.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, to Alan Johnston’s family and friends, I express my sincere support on behalf of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament. I hope that their ordeal will soon have a relieving and positive conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">I too would like to offer my support and that of the ALDE Group to Alan Johnston and his family.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not think any of us can imagine why he is being held. He is a man who has consistently spoken up for the Palestinian people. To kidnap someone like him is unbelievable. What do they hope to achieve? It certainly does nothing for the Palestinian cause, as many Palestinians themselves have pointed out. His only offence is his belief that the story of Gaza and its people should be told in a fair and balanced way, and he has being doing that in an exceptional manner for the last three years. He was the only foreign correspondent living permanently in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all hoped that he would have been released by now, as the 14 others kidnapped since 2005 were released, and we are today adding our voices to those calling for the Palestinian Authority to redouble its efforts to secure Alan Johnston’s speedy release. We are also calling for all attacks on journalists to cease. What more can any of us say? I am sure that people across the EU are hoping and praying for his release. All we are doing today is trying to add our voices to those of his parents and his colleagues, and to say to his kidnappers: realise that if anything happens to him, you will have lost a strong voice telling your story to the world. All you will achieve is to isolate yourself and the Palestinian people further. That cannot be what you want. You want your voice to be heard, not to be further marginalised. These acts make it more difficult for those of us who have always supported the Palestinian cause to persuade people of the validity of the argument, and that is why it is completely self-defeating and betrays the Palestinian people, who continue to suffer.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Alan Johnston has been a BBC journalist for 16 years and has worked in a variety of countries, including Afghanistan and Uzbekistan, so he has not exactly chosen a comfortable life! During his three years in Gaza he has taken a strong interest in social and political developments there and he has told the story of the people of Gaza. Therefore, as others have said, it very much harms the Palestinian cause for him not to be doing the job that he loves and does so well.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2005 and 2006 alone, 181 journalists and assistants were killed, 1678 arrested, 56 kidnapped and 2780 physically attacked or threatened. The year 2006 saw the highest death toll since 1994 when 103 died, in particular in Rwanda, Algeria and the former Yugoslavia. Censorship and media bans are, of course, widespread and persistent.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this joint motion for a resolution we are calling on all EU bodies – Member State diplomats, the High Representative for CFSP and the Commission – to strengthen and coordinate their efforts to secure Mr Johnston’s release. We are also calling on the Palestinian Authority to increase its efforts and it, no doubt, will give the matter all the greater priority if it is pressed by the Palestinian people. I thank all those in Gaza – journalists and citizens of all kinds – for their vocal demands for Alan Johnston’s release. They know that they need a journalist of integrity and commitment to give them a window on the world.</p>

The BBC correspondent, Alan Johnston, was abducted in Gaza on 12 March. A large amount of anxiety was prevalent at last Monday’s Council of Foreign Ministers surrounding Mr Johnston, who has already been missing for six weeks. We call for his immediate and unconditional release.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Johnston is an internationally respected journalist with many friends in Gaza. It has always been a matter of concern for him that the world should see with its own eyes how things stand there. His abduction is a criminal act which I can only condemn in the strongest possible terms.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it has been more than six weeks since Alan Johnston was kidnapped, and the Commission has expressed its solidarity with his family, friends and colleagues at this very difficult time.</p>
      <p sl="en">Margot Wallström, as Vice-President of the Commission, has made a public statement on the kidnapping of Mr Johnston on behalf of the whole College, expressing its deep concern over his plight and calling for his immediate release. This week, the kidnapping was condemned by the Council, which has called for Mr Johnston’s unconditional release. Furthermore, yesterday, my colleague Louis Michel also raised the issue of the abduction of the BBC journalist during a meeting with the Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister, Mr al-Ahmad. He asked him to use all his influence and contacts and to do everything in his power to locate Mr Johnston. The Deputy Prime Minister assured Mr Michel that he would do all he could to secure a rapid release.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Michel also repeated those requests in his meetings with other Palestinian interlocutors during his trip to the region. Intensive coordinated diplomatic efforts are under way for an immediate release of Mr Johnston. Our staff in Jerusalem are following developments closely and inform us that the Palestinian authorities, in cooperation with the security forces, are discussing all possible options with the UK Government, with a view to a successful outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">This remains a high priority for President Abbas, and we note the public statements that have also been made by Prime Minister Haniyeh, as well as by Mr Barghouti, on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, and by Palestinians around the world, condemning this kidnapping.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, by means of this resolution today, we are giving expression to our significant anxiety regarding the increasing number of political assassinations which have been committed over recent years in the Philippines. The human rights organisation, Karapatan, has recorded 839 cases of summary executions since 2001. All the victims were individuals who had given their support to matters of concern facing the Filipino people: farmers fighting for their land, workers and trade union leaders who are standing up for fair wages and better working conditions, and committed members of the clergy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Arbitrary executions, omnipresent political repression, growing militarisation and the fact that perpetrators from paramilitary and military units are exempt from punishment and protected have, unfortunately, become a government trademark. For a long time, foreign countries have looked away. As far as the International Court of Justice in The Hague is concerned, ignorance and a misjudgment of the situation are just as responsible for the fact that foreign countries have turned a blind eye for a long time as the approval given by the USA which the government in Manila could, and can continue, to rely on.</p>
      <p sl="de">We condemn the rough and systematic violations of citizens’ rights, the abductions, the disappearances and political assassinations. We firmly call on the State authorities in the Philippines to carry out the necessary inquiries and to bring those responsible to justice. We call on the State authorities to ratify the UN Convention on abduction by force and to enact the implementing provisions. All these steps are required as the first step in de-escalation so that, in a few weeks, halfway democratic elections can be guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in his report dated 22 March to the UN Human Rights Council, the UN’s special rapporteur, Mr Philip Alston, explained in unequivocal terms what these summary executions in the Philippines are all about. As has been formulated in the joint resolution, victims of these summary executions include members of opposition parties, the clergy, trade union leaders, farmers, journalists, lawyers, human rights activists and so on, as well as witnesses of other summary murders who were accused by government representatives of being a front for illegally armed groups.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Arroyo Government bears a high degree of responsibility for over 800 political assassinations since he came to power in 2001. Within the framework of so-called counterinsurgency, the Filipino army and police also resort to ways of committing political assassinations. In a chapter of the report entitled Orders of Battle , in the light of documents held by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, it is clearly shown that summary executions are an army and police strategy. This report, on which basis the Armed Forces of the Philippines act, and which is also frequently implemented by the Filipino National Police, makes provision for a military fight against political opponents.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now, the Conservative group obviously wishes to strike any reference ‘to the role played by the armed forces in these murders’ from the joint resolution. This is nothing short of scandalous. This would not only amount to a slap in the face for the United Nations and its special rapporteur, but also a slap in the face for the victims and their friends and family. In the UN special rapporteur’s report, the following must also be emphasised: ‘Newspapers carry almost daily reports of senior military officials urging that such groups be neutralised and calling upon the populace to recognise that to support their candidates in the upcoming elections would be to support the enemy.’ That leaves nothing to be desired in terms of clarity and I ask that the passage mentioned not be deleted from the resolution so that this House sends out a clear signal.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, on the eve of important elections – the local and legislative elections in the Philippines – it is appropriate and timely that we should be discussing some of that country’s main problems, in particular the worrying escalation of extrajudicial crimes and assassinations – now more than 800 since President Arroyo took power in the archipelago in 2001 – the huge majority of which have so far gone unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="es">The current situation shows a clear pattern of political assassinations in the Philippines, and we must therefore call upon the government in Manila to take the appropriate measures with a view to putting an end to the threats and harassment against members of the opposition, journalists, farm workers calling for their rights to be respected within the context of the agrarian reform under way, human rights activists and even witnesses in trials of their victimisers.</p>
      <p sl="es">Various human rights organisations – such as Food First Information and Action Network (FIAN) – have for a long time been warning, for example, of the non-implementation of national agrarian reform programmes, which means that many landowners are refusing to hand land over to the farmers. The climate of violence linked to this situation has now led to the assassination of at least 38 campesino leaders.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should welcome the fact that the President has committed herself to the principle of ‘zero tolerance’ in the face of human rights violations, but their scale demands much more ambitious actions, particularly in view of the fact that various national and international reports directly implicate parts of the army and the police in those violations. Notable amongst these reports are the statements by the UN Human Rights Council’s Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston, and by the Melo Commission.</p>
      <p sl="es">The situation is particularly alarming in the Bontoc peninsula, where hundreds of farmers are facing many cases of harassment and physical violence perpetrated by private armed groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I believe that it is important to take note of the work carried out by the negotiation panel of the peace process as well as the government’s announcement that complete self-determination for the people of Mindanao would be guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, I must once again express the reservations of many of us about the inclusion of certain groups – such as the Ejercito del Nuevo Pueblo – on the European Union’s list of terrorist groups, since that does not contribute to future peace negotiations but rather hinders them.</p>
      <p sl="es">As requested by various international organisations and institutions defending and promoting human rights, we hope that this urgent resolution will help to persuade the Philippines Government to take a much firmer position in the fight against political murders and to guarantee the safety of the people under threat, in particular farmers and political and human rights activists.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in two weeks, elections will be held in the Philippines. The risk is rising that internal political conflicts will escalate. Since 2006, as has been mentioned by my fellow Members, journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, farmers and priests have been murdered. What is unclear is who the perpetrators are. It is clear, however, that the murders always follow the same pattern. The authorities are incapable of conducting investigations with sufficient thoroughness. The judicial system is overloaded, under funded and inefficient. The number of convictions is so low that one can almost already talk about a climate of impunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Arroyo and his government are aware of the seriousness of the situation. A special police task force and the independent Melo Commission were set up. Their recommendations resulted in the State President ordering the strengthening of the investigation and prosecution processes, the establishment of special courts and, finally, the creation of witness protection programmes as well. In February, the UN’s special rapporteur, Mr Philip Alston, was able to question those responsible and affected extensively. I side with his demand that accusations regarding the involvement of elements of the military or individuals in the army should be examined. The European Union should offer both technical support and support in terms of personnel to enable these murders to be cleared up and the justice system to be improved in a sustainable manner.</p>

Unfortunately, the situation in the Philippines is once again such that, while in other countries elections celebrate democracy to some extent and are refreshing even if they create tensions, the Philippine press are only writing about how many people will die and how violent the forthcoming elections will be. This has been happening for over half a year, and is something that I have been following closely. It is a bad omen for that country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I visited the Philippines this year and tried to become acquainted with the situation. I would like to say that in the Philippines the voice of the European Union is listened to very carefully and it is a good thing that our Parliament is very critical of any violence which may accompany the political process. We should clearly ask the government of the Philippines to intensify efforts to ensure that political killings cease to be a constant part of the election campaign in that country.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Gloria Arroyo’s succession to the Philippines Presidency after former President Estrada’s impeachment trial on corruption charges, and her eventual election in May 2004, have brought some improvements to the country, particularly in terms of security. The Government of the Philippines has degraded the military effectiveness of Islamist terrorists in the south-east, and negotiated a peace accord with one group and an ongoing ceasefire with another. However, for some time, sadly there has been a series of murky extrajudicial killings, allegedly carried out by the security forces. The government rightly recognised this as a very serious matter and ordered appropriate investigations.</p>
      <p sl="de">This resulted in a series of recommendations this February from Justice Melo’s independent commission, set up specifically to address this issue, followed by a six-point government-endorsed plan to stop further human rights abuses and end the existing climate of impunity. I warmly welcome this approach, and in particular the setting-up of a dedicated police task force, Usig, to bring those in authority who have ordered human rights violations to eventual justice.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the Philippines have ratified the key, international human rights covenants and conventions. The government of the Philippines respects its citizens’ human rights in principle. A further positive note is the abolition of the death penalty in June 2006. The EU has worked towards this time and again.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, there is cause for alarm. In 2006, the killings and abductions of journalists, left-wing political activists, civil rights activists and Church representatives increased significantly throughout the entire country. The opposition has provided reports of executions without court proceedings and holds the government and its security apparatus responsible. At the very least, the government is accused of failing to resolve crimes with the necessary vigour. For its part, the government rejects these accusations and suspects, at least in part, purges within the militant left-wing camp.</p>
      <p sl="de">The most prominent recent victim was Bishop Alberto Ramento, who was extremely critical of the government. His murder was already described as having been cleared up the very day it had been committed. It was alleged to have been a robbery with murder committed by a youth. Grave doubts were expressed by Mr Ramento’s cohorts and criticism made of the inadequate and unprofessional preservation of evidence.</p>
      <p sl="de">Shortly before starting out on his European trip in the summer of 2006, President Arroyo appointed a Commission chaired by the former Supreme Court judge, José Melo, to investigate the murders of politically active government critics. The Melo Commission report was published in February 2007 in the face of massive public pressure. This report confirmed the accusation surrounding a lack of readiness to produce clarifying evidence and apportioned primary responsibility to the armed forces. An investigation by UN special rapporteur Alston has reached the same conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU has repeatedly addressed the Philippines on this problem in an unequivocal manner through its embassies in the country and political meetings within the framework of the human rights dialogue. On the strength of this, and under public pressure from active Filipino civil society, the government gave a public presentation of the measures taken hitherto, acknowledged its shortcomings and asked the EU for support in establishing special courts and special public prosecutors’ offices, in consolidating witness protection, strengthening the technical and forensic capabilities of the security forces and in consolidating consciousness on the part of the security forces in observing human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the invitation of the Filipino Government, an EU mission is currently in the country examining the conditions for this request. Furthermore, the national Human Rights Commission and civil society should be strengthened with a view to observing the situation. In addition to the killings and abductions of critics of the regime and government, serious accusations are being levelled in the Philippines concerning torture, the disappearance of individuals, unlawful detention, human trafficking and the abuse of women and children. Above all in the military conflict with various Communist and separatist rebel groups, and in the fight against terrorism, human rights violations are regularly committed by the police and the military and acts of violence also committed by members of extremist groups.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Commission follows developments in the Philippines very closely. In recent high-level contacts – including the meeting between President Barroso and President Arroyo last September, and between Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Foreign Minister Romulo in March – we have encouraged the Filipino authorities to advance their economic and social reforms, but expressed grave concern about the sharp increase in extrajudicial killings. We also made clear our support for the peace process in Mindanao.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our primary concern is that the extrajudicial killings should stop and that the crimes which have been committed should be properly investigated and the perpetrators duly prosecuted, building on the conclusions of the reports of Senior Judge Melo and Professor Alston.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, together with Member States, is therefore responding positively to a request from the Filipino Government to provide technical support for investigations. Because the areas in which support has been requested are quite diverse, we are preparing a needs-assessment mission with Member State and Commission participation, which will visit the Philippines in May for direct discussions with the authorities and other interested groups, including civil society. The Commission is funding the majority of the costs of the mission and has played a lead role in its preparation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The findings of this mission should provide a basis on which the EU can mobilise effective support for the investigations. Naturally, we will seek to work in close coordination with the UN rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, Professor Alston. I am very glad that Parliament has signalled its support. We must continue to encourage the authorities to make sure that the investigations are adequately carried out and that the perpetrators are brought to justice in a timely manner.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission considers that progress is being made in the Mindanao peace process. A formal peace agreement may not be too far away. At present, we are giving substantial indirect support through assistance for rural development and health and improvement of livelihoods. We have signalled that we are willing to give important direct assistance when the parties are closer to signature of a formal peace agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the other insurgency involving the NPA, we should continue to encourage the Filipino authorities to re-open peace talks and allow those who are willing to abandon the gun for politics to do so, while ensuring that the new security legislation is implemented in full respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="nl">On behalf of my group, Mr Pafilis spoke on the subject of Zimbabwe this afternoon. I am aware that what he and his Greek party mainly want is to highlight the long-term conflict between the former British colonial empire and the former movement for independence, led by Mugabe, the country’s current President. This is underlined as a conflict between absolute evil and absolute good. Like my colleague Mr Pafilis, I am in favour of the Mugabe of the 70s and against colonialism, but he and I have very different opinions about the present, as I have made clear in previous urgency debates. I am in favour of land reform, in other words for the land of large farmers to be carved up in favour of small farmers. The way in which this is being done in Zimbabwe, however, has led to violence, intimidation and people fearing for their own lives, not least black farmers and workers on the land. Subsequently, towns, too, were on the receiving end of this sort of violence. Mugabe is no longer serving his people against colonial exploiters, but is plunging them into chaos, oppression and poverty. Since a regime such as this one is founded on violence and intimidation, and does not deserve to carry on, I will be voting in favour of the resolution on Zimbabwe.</p>
