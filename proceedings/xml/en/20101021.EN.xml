      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the night of 18 October the town of Paola, the birthplace of Saint Francis, was hit by a violent rainstorm affecting the whole of Calabria: huge damage was caused to public buildings, private homes, water and sewage networks, and electricity and telephone networks, not to mention landslips and mudslides. Many families have had to leave their homes, and schools have remained closed.</p>
      <p sl="it">Episodes such as this have been occurring in Calabria for a long time now, possibly due to the effects of climate change. A state of natural disaster will be declared shortly, and we hope that the European Solidarity Fund can be activated. I would like to express my solidarity – which I hope is shared by this House – with the entire population, including that of the neighbouring towns that have suffered damage.</p>

We would like to express our solidarity and our concern about the disaster that has hit Calabria and, naturally, all the members of this Parliament declare their support to those affected in that beautiful region of Italy and Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when looking at EU-Moldova relations, I believe it is uncontroversial that we have achieved a lot of progress in record time, but domestically the country still faces many challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">The referendum of 5 September was meant to resolve the political deadlock by changing the rules for electing the President. It failed. That is regrettable. However, whether the referendum would comply with democratic standards was also an important question. Crucially, its effective compliance has been confirmed by the international observers. This is an encouraging sign.</p>
      <p sl="en">The elections of 28 November are equally important for the consolidation of democracy in the country. We will continue sending firm messages in that respect to all stakeholders. Thereafter, all political forces will have to work together, both to elect a President and to choose a government capable of taking the country through a critical reform path.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we will sustain our unwavering support to the structural reforms conducted by the Moldovan Government. Let me highlight a few important aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is not only by far the largest donor to Moldova, but in March also succeeded in mobilising over forty donors to support Moldova’s reforms. They pledged an impressive EUR 1.9 billion for the years 2010-2013, including our own EUR 550 million commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the last months, we have provided timely responses to a number of the government's specific needs: providing high-level policy advice to ministers; supporting democratisation efforts in rule-of-law related areas; helping organise the electoral consultations; addressing emergency needs after last summer’s floods; and improving possibilities for Moldovan wine exports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Alongside the Moldovan government, we have actively engaged with the population living in the Transnistrian region via small-scale projects, mostly in the social area. Next year, we will start implementing the Comprehensive Institution-Building programme under the Eastern Partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">That programme will help Moldova prepare for, and implement, the Association Agreement that we are currently negotiating. The latest round of negotiations in Chisinau on 13 and 14 October demonstrated yet again that these negotiations are progressing at a very good speed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our assistance has also taken the form of direct transfers to the Moldovan budget. Since the last quarter of 2009, EUR 37 million has been disbursed as sectoral budget support, with an additional EUR 15 million to come soon. Out of this, about EUR 8.5 million was directly allocated to help the poorest strata of the population. Now that President Buzek has signed the relevant legislative decision, we expect to disburse soon the EUR 40 million of the first tranche of macro-financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the same spirit, we will carry on our busy schedule of political contacts and technical exchanges. In a few days, I will meet with Prime Minister Filat, in Luxembourg. In November, the EU-Moldova trade sub-committee will examine Moldova’s response to the Commission’s key recommendations in view of preparing negotiations on a deep and comprehensive free trade area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Additionally, we have engaged with Moldova in a dedicated Dialogue on Human Rights and in an energy dialogue, and are negotiating an aviation services agreement. We have actively followed up on the visa dialogue launched in June. Next Monday, drawing on the outcome of the fact-finding missions conducted in September by independent experts, the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to release conclusions that should address this issue.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The purpose of this debate is for us to discuss the reforms carried out by the Republic of Moldova during the last year and the progress made on the path to European integration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This country has been on the European Union’s agenda for a year because it has met its commitments. I would like to mention some of those commitments. A plan has been drawn up with priority measures to be carried out in essential areas of reform, along with another plan for justice reform. Implementation of both plans has started. Dialogue on human rights has been initiated. In addition, the parliament of the Republic of Moldova ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court in September. Intensive negotiations are being conducted on the Association Agreement, with excellent results. Only a year has gone by, but those involved in starting the process guarantee that it will continue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Republic of Moldova is the state which has made the furthest progress within the EU’s Eastern Partnership. This is why I am asking the Council to assess this state individually on its own merits. Progress signifies political will, hard work and dedication, which need to be rewarded. We rewarded the Western Balkans for the measures they have taken. Let us go ahead and do the same for the Republic of Moldova too.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the dialogue on visas Moldova has made great progress in all four areas. This is why I am asking the Council at the next session on 25 October to invite the Commission to draw up an action plan so that citizens from the Republic of Moldova can travel without requiring visas. Direct contact between people is worth more than any declaration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the case of the Transnistria region, a solution is vital for the political and economic stability of the Republic Moldova and this region. The EU must play a stronger role at a political level and we must be involved through joint projects making changes which people can see.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, the European integration process has helped build democracy and freedom at an unprecedented rate in European history. Let us look in Central and Eastern Europe at how the situation has changed in the last 20 years. Peace now reigns in the Western Balkans too and reforms are under way. Let us do what is necessary to achieve the same situation in the Republic of Moldova as well.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Republic of Moldova has a single option – between ‘Transnistrialisation’ and ‘Europeanisation’. That is to say between an oligarchic past of a Soviet nature and a future of security, prosperity and social justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moldova’s development has so far been negatively influenced by its internal political instability. The fundamental problem of the Republic of Moldova is not linked to the external challenges it faces, but to the internal division among political forces. That internal political instability has denied the ruling coalition the time to implement its pro-European options. Moldova now faces a turning point. The outcome of this early election should aim to lead the country towards a future of European modernisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we call on all political forces in Moldova that are proposing a future of European modernisation for the country to avoid any unnecessary protagonism or confrontation, and to concentrate on developing a broad vision with the aim of directing the country towards achieving its European goals.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="2155" name="Graham Watson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, eighteen months ago this House was shocked by the brutality of the events in Chisinau. A few weeks later, we had the great pleasure of welcoming here in our gallery the leaders of the democratic political parties from that country, embarked on a new path. We shared the enthusiasm of Moldova’s people for a new future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been pleased to note since then the progress that country has made. There is still much progress to be made – not least in bringing to justice the perpetrators of those brutal events – but, if Moldova returns to office the current coalition in the elections next month, there is a good chance that, despite the difficulties of the economic recession, the country can complete its transformation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The British writer, Francis Bacon, observed that hope makes a very good breakfast but a rather poor supper. Moldova’s governing parties should be in no doubt that implementation of reforms must follow the legal acts which permit such reforms. Time is not on our side. There is much to be done very soon.</p>
      <p sl="de">My group commends Commissioner Füle and his services for the work they have done to assist Moldova. We welcome the formation of the Friends of Moldova and the superb meeting of European countries which took place to help Moldova to move forward. Every effort is being made on the European Union’s side to help this desperately poor country move towards European standards. I hope that when the Council looks at the visa regime next week it will help us to find a way forward on the visa issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">As one of our founding fathers said, a country’s European vocation is determined not by the European Union but by the European spirit of its people. We urge the people of Moldova to show that European spirit in the elections next month.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we welcome the progress made by the Republic of Moldova and hope that the forthcoming electoral process can further consolidate the democratic institutions and ensure respect for the rule of law and of human rights in Moldova.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that there is broad support for Moldova’s future EU membership – not NATO membership – within Moldovan society. In spite of their different political platforms, all parties represented in the Moldovan Parliament declare that they are for European cooperation and integration as well. But, taking into account my own country of Latvia’s experience of EU membership, I have tried to explain during my conversations with Moldovan politicians that EU membership cannot be an end in itself. It is very important to step up efforts to implement deep and consistent economic and judicial reforms, notably through the fight against corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moldovan society is multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic; moreover, essential differences exist in relation to the assessment of historical events. It is therefore quite dangerous to create additional dividing lines within Moldovan society. In my opinion, a recent decree establishing 28 June as Soviet Occupation Day, which triggered a negative reaction on the part of a large number of Moldovan residents, did not consolidate society but had just the opposite effect.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moldovan society also varies according to the nationality held by its residents. The large proportion of residents having dual citizenship creates additional differences in respect of rights as well, and so we have to make every effort to abolish these differences and to provide a visa-free regime for all Moldovans.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="4521" name="Charles Tannock" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, no one is disputing that Moldova has a long way to go before it achieves its ultimate goal of joining the European Union, which is a goal that my group, the ECR, supports. It remains one of Europe’s poorest countries, despite being in the WTO, and, as such, is vulnerable to organised crime, human trafficking and corruption. Moldova remains hamstrung by the ongoing frozen conflict with the Russian-speaking and politically Russian- dominated breakaway region of Transnistria.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, since the Communists were ousted from power 15 months ago, Moldova has begun to make substantial progress. The parties in the Alliance for European Integration, the current ruling coalition, have shown an impressive capacity to work together to accelerate Moldova’s integration with the European Union. For its part, the Union should maintain pressure on the Moldovan Government for further progress in economic reforms and, in particular, improving the rule of law and good governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we should also reward and engage more with Chisinau. The visa issue has been mentioned, but I would also like to raise the issue of Euronest, which offers opportunities for EU and Moldovan politicians alike to debate common interests. Sadly, Euronest – which was something which appeared in my report in the previous parliament – remains paralysed because of the dispute over Belarus representation, as our Parliament does not recognise its parliament, which was not democratically elected.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that one day all clearly European countries in the Eastern Partnership, namely Moldova, Ukraine and a future democratic Belarus, will become EU candidates.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this debate demonstrates Europe’s commitment to the divided Republic of Moldova, and I am extremely pleased about that. In my country, the Netherlands, citizens have for many years been developing some inspiring social initiatives offering young people from Moldova genuine prospects. In this context I would also like to mention with pride the Orhei Foundation in Bunschoten-Spakenburg, a village which tackles such things with great vigour. I can look the people of this Foundation in the eye because we are also talking about this issue here, demonstrating commitment. Incidentally, Moldova is seeking an in-depth, comprehensive trade agreement with the European Union. Commissioner Füle also mentions this. Commissioner, what is the situation with regard to this, and has any genuine progress been made yet?</p>
      <p sl="nl">A broadening of the sales opportunities for Moldovan products, particularly agricultural products and wines from Chişinău, is vital, since Moldova’s main traditional sales market, Russia, regularly closes and restricts its borders for political reasons. Commissioner, you have already mentioned this, but is there any way in which the European Union can offer comfort in response to this need on the part of Moldova?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, a question about the German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘Meseberg initiative’. Is Russia now genuinely committed to finding a solution to the Transnistria question in exchange for enhanced political dialogue between the EU and Russia? I am hearing noises indicating that the Kremlin is not taking any action for the time being. Commissioner, I would in particular like to wish you much success and perseverance in your efforts to bring Moldova closer to Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017" speaker_id="96835" name="Traian Ungureanu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is ample proof that Moldova’s commitment to European values and standards is genuine and effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moldova is actually the best example of implementing pro-European policies among our Eastern neighbours. In actual fact, Moldova’s euro-credentials make it fully compatible with Western Balkan states.</p>
      <p sl="en">The positive precedent set by Moldova should be acknowledged and encouraged. The deterioration of democratic institutions in neighbouring Ukraine increases the importance of Moldova for the EU's policies on its eastern flank. In this context, it is vital that the general elections on 28 November confirm Moldova’s continued drive towards European integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is indeed high time for the EU to send a positive signal to Moldova and the Moldovans. Thousands of Moldovan families are divided by a visa barrier. The EU-Moldova visa dialogue presents us with a huge opportunity. This dialogue should enter an operational phase. Let us hope that the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 October will invite the Commission to draw up an action plan for visa liberalisation. A pro-European, integrated Moldova would have a beneficial effect on the EU’s eastern frontier, where weak governance and unsolved conflicts are a continuous threat to European stability.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The challenges Moldova is currently facing, which are also part of our overall objective, include strengthening the multi-ethnic state, its identity, the political settlement of the Transnistrian problem and Moldova’s membership of the European Union as an autonomous, independent state.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The visa liberalisation process is particularly important. As we have seen in similar cases for the countries of former Yugoslavia, it delivers good results. The tendency to use a fast-track procedure for issuing Bulgarian and Romanian passports simultaneously to Moldovan citizens is not a solution to this problem and entails certain risks. At the same time, the authorities in Chişinau must ensure that the benefit of the EUR 90 million in macro-financial assistance which the European Union is granting will be felt by all Moldovan citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin. This is especially important for the Bulgarian minority in Moldova as well, which lives in one of the poorest economic regions in the country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As a member of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee Delegation, it has been a pleasure for me to follow Moldova’s positive progress and I can confirm that the Republic of Moldova’s commitment to the European path has been very clearly demonstrated during the last year. I would like to remind you at this point of the reforms made to the economy, justice system and public administration. At the same time, we must be realistic and acknowledge that the transition process in Moldova is not easy and many reforms are still to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am pleased that progress is being made in the discussions aimed at visa liberalisation. However, I think that we need the Commission to establish a clear road map for achieving this objective and, why not, for getting rid of visas in the future altogether. The Republic of Moldova will have a crucial test to get through during the parliamentary elections on 28 November and I hope that the European path which the country has committed to will be approved by the population and continue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Macro-financial and political assistance from European institutions and some Member States has been of paramount importance. Given the positive results from our policy, I ask Europe’s institutions – Parliament, the Council and the European Commission – to continue their actions in support of Moldova in order to give Moldova confidence and encourage it to continue along the path of reform and rapprochement with the European Union so that it can ultimately become integrated as a full member.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ten days ago, I had the opportunity to visit Moldova as part of a special delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs with, amongst others, fellow Members Mrs Macovei and Mr Watson. We were in Moldova at an extremely important moment for the country – several weeks after the unsuccessful constitutional referendum of 5 September and also several weeks before very important parliamentary elections, which, as you know, will be held on 28 November. Above all, what we saw was the very large support of the nation and Moldavian society for the process of European integration. Nearly three quarters of Moldavians support this process.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We also saw the huge progress which has been made by the government of Prime Minister Filat on the road to European integration and the many reforms, including significant progress in the fight against corruption which had previously been eating away at the country. Of course, problems do exist: problems resulting from the economic crisis and problems resulting from the as yet unresolved situation in Transnistria. However, in order for the process of reforms to be continued after 28 November, a clear signal from the European Union is needed, so I am hoping that the forthcoming Council summit will manage to push through the visa liberalisation process.</p>

    <intervention id="4-021" speaker_id="96814" name="Elena Băsescu" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">I too would like to thank all those who have made this debate possible. It is our duty to look towards the Republic of Moldova with a sense of great responsibility, especially now with the elections approaching. The government of the Alliance for European Integration has shown through the special effort it has made that it is ready to launch an extensive process of political, economic and institutional reforms, thereby leading the way in this area within the Eastern Partnership. This is taking place after eight years of Communist government when basic rights such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to fair justice were seriously violated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The reform process in the Republic of Moldova must continue predominantly in the area of justice and internal affairs. An effective battle must be waged against corruption, and freedom of justice guaranteed. At the same time, safe and humane detention must be ensured so that fundamental human rights are respected. The Republic of Moldova has been going through a political crisis for well over 18 months now, with the failure of the presidential election and the validation of the referendum.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the forthcoming elections on 28 November are a huge gamble for Moldova’s path towards Europe. Democracy is once again going through a difficult test. I wish to state with full responsibility that a failure for democracy in the Republic of Moldova at the forthcoming elections will also mark, to a small extent, a failure for the EU’s policy in this country. We need to have in the immediate vicinity of the EU a partner which assumes the values we share.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to end by emphasising that the language spoken by the Republic of Moldova’s citizens is now an official language of the European Union. This is also another reason why it should receive our support.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-022" speaker_id="34232" name="Kristian Vigenin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="bg">I am pleased that the European Parliament is devoting its time to discussing the situation in Moldova, a country which is essentially European. In this respect, we must say that the ruling Coalition for European Integration actually contributed a great deal to the process of bringing Moldova closer to the European Union and it must be given great credit for this.</p>
      <p sl="bg">At the same time, its citizens expect more results in the areas of the economy and social development. It is no coincidence that this is also turning into the key issue in the current campaign. Establishing relations with the European Union is not a one-off event. It is a long-term process and Moldova’s path towards rapprochement must become an irreversible policy.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Failure to amend the constitution led to this state of political instability, which is at risk of being repeated after the present elections. This is why I am making an appeal to the leading political forces, irrespective of differences and the election result, to do what is required to guarantee political stability in Moldova, which will give them the chance to act in the interest of their citizens and of their country’s European future.</p>

    <intervention id="4-023" speaker_id="96838" name="Cristian Dan Preda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="ro">Romanian imperialism is how Moldova’s Communists describe the interest being shown and speeches being made by MPs in Romania regarding the situation in Chişinău, regardless of whether it is President Băsescu or MEPs. In other words, the Communists in Chişinău would like Bucharest to shut up. In my own view, I must say that I do not think that they are entitled to expect this. On the contrary, it is our duty to speak out.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The main reason for this is that a large number of primarily European, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens, and other citizens too, live in the Republic of Moldova. I believe that, just like any other European citizen, those living in Moldova should also enjoy the rights which derive from their political status.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, we must keep a very close eye on Chişinău because a coalition government there has been acting for well over a year in the name of European integration. It is not only about the name this coalition has. Certainly, if it had been called the Alliance for Russia, we would not have shown as much interest in it. It has been called the Alliance for European Integration, but it is not just the name that matters, but the very brave action of this government. Mrs Macovei and Commissioner Füle have explained what this brave action entails.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I was in Chişinău and Tiraspol last week and I noticed that becoming European is also at stake in the election campaign which is due to start for the November elections. Moldova’s citizens will actually decide not only between different political forces, but also between continuing and abandoning its path towards Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Let us not fool ourselves. I saw that even the head of the EU delegation in Chişinău is starting to fool himself. The Communists do not want integration. The Communists demonstrated a year and a few months ago what they want. The demonstrations in April provided very clear proof of where the interests of the Communists in Chişinău lie. This is why I hope that citizens will understand the message and attitudes of the parties, and that politicians themselves will also understand the wishes of the people expressed at the ballot box.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Let us ask ourselves why we are devoting so much attention to such a small country which lies in the vicinity of the Black Sea but does not have access to it. Perhaps the reason we are talking about Moldova is because it is a small country where two worlds meet. One of these, which once symbolised the Soviet Union, is with great difficulty becoming a thing of the past. Moldova is a divided country. Part of it is under occupation and is being supported by external forces. I think this country deserves our support. It is a small country, which is home to very brave people who want to come closer to the European Union and to build a democracy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, the situation with Moldova is reminiscent of the concept in physics in which it is not the force itself which is important, but the point at which it is applied. These millions of euro of which you spoke are not very impressive. It is only a small amount of money, but applied at the right point and at the right moment it can bring about the positive effect we want. I wish success to all those who want to build democracy in Moldova. I am not interested in party affiliation, but I would like Moldova to consolidate, to build a better future for itself and to become our partner in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The progress Moldova has made so far indicates that this country could become an example of a success story of a participant in the Eastern Partnership of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The current pro-European government led by the Alliance for European Integration presented the citizens of Moldova with a clear and important political perspective for the future democratic progress of the country. However, it is also true that the internal political situation has been negatively affected by the long-lasting disagreement on constitutional reform. Following the unsuccessful referendum, the upcoming elections ought to overcome the impasse in the political negotiations between the parties. I believe that the European Union should explicitly recognise the important progress achieved by the current government in strengthening its relationship with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On Monday 25 October, the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to issue its conclusions on Moldova. They should express support for the pro-European steps that have so far been taken by the current government, and most importantly, they could ask the Commission to work out an action plan as regards visa liberalisation. This is an important issue for the citizens of Moldova. Of course, the ultimate outcome will depend primarily on the election results. As far as the European Parliament is concerned, I believe our attitude towards Moldova should be more positive. We should demonstrate more clearly our support of the country’s pro-European forces and show them that we care about Moldova becoming a future member of a united European family. We should convince them that such a future is also in their best interest.</p>

Those in charge on both sides should be congratulated. Both the pace of internal reform and the EU response should continue to get beyond the point of no return sooner, rather than later.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moldova’s chances depend, of course, on the solution to the Transnistrian conflict. In that respect, we are encouraged by the current discussions on this topic announced in Potsdam at the German-Russian summit and, supposedly, evoked at the recent trilateral summit in Deauville, capitalising on the apparent willingness of Russia to find a solution. Let us all keep faith and work together to bring this last piece of Latinity into the EU.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, when we have considered the Balkans in the past, for example, when we focused on the problems of Kosovo or Bosnia, we have tended to overlook Moldova. The EU should long ago have taken on the role of mediator in the conflicts involving Moldova and its neighbours. It is regrettable that Moldova has now rejected the EU’s offer of mediation in the Transnistrian conflict.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is no coincidence that Moldova is the poor relation in the European family. This is due to the country’s chaotic, post-socialist economy. As we know, the prime industrial area in the east of Moldova has declared its independence with the support of Russia and, by doing so, has put the seal on the country’s economic decline, because the economy is based solely on agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="de">When the citizens of Moldova go to the polls at the end of November to elect a new government, it will be important to ensure that the elections run smoothly, in order to prevent further unrest and an intensification of the conflict with Romania, for example.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Commissioner, I had the opportunity to observe the re-elections in Moldova. When we talked to the representatives of the then opposition parties, we saw great desire for change. That change has taken place. The current prime minister, Mr Filat, speaking at the time as a representative of the opposition, clearly declared European aspirations. We spoke with great approval of the effects of his work when he was a guest here in the European Parliament. This has been confirmed, too, by the delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs which visited Moldova recently.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The internal problems, in particular over Transnistria, and the breakup and disruption of the country, which are a symbol of the past and of division, are all very difficult issues.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on containers lost at sea and compensation by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism (O-0115/2010 - B7-0469/2010).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-037" speaker_id="1309" name="Brian Simpson" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as you said, I speak this morning on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on an issue that has been overlooked for so long, namely containers falling from ships at sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is amazing to me that, in this modern day and age, thousands of these containers go missing each year, with the great majority of them falling off the ships into our oceans. It is estimated that a staggering 10 000 containers are lost at sea each year. It would appear to us that shipping lines and insurers are quite happy to accept this figure and do nothing about it. In European waters, 2 000 containers a year are lost at sea, and this figure would appear to be rising year on year. These containers are a menace to navigation, they could pollute the seas with both toxic and non-toxic materials, and they leave local authorities with large clean-up costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Transport Committee is now demanding action to reduce this figure and is sending a signal to the maritime industry that we are not prepared to tolerate this state of affairs much longer. The MARIN Institute in the Netherlands found the main reasons for container stack collapses were faulty lashings, overweight containers and faulty stowage. In addition, crews on larger container ships have difficulty in assessing when severe loads are moving forward and/or aft due to weather conditions, which can amplify vertical acceleration in these areas beyond the vessel’s actual design specifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, the absence of a strict liability compensation convention for non-toxic substances leaves local government picking up the cost of the clean-up. Parliament is now demanding that shipping companies accept their responsibilities on this issue. We would like to see the Commission becoming more proactive in solving this unacceptable state of affairs. Today I am asking the Commission to study the results obtained by the Lashing@sea project and to come forward with proposals to improve container lashing procedures and equipment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, we would like to see action to ensure that all containers are correctly weighed in port and correctly stowed before a ship sets sail for sea, as well as fitting automated beacons to aid container location.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, we are asking the Commission to look at the compensation regime so that local and regional authorities are not left short-changed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to return to the obligations of the wider maritime industry to get their act together. I appreciate that containers will be lost in severe storms. What I cannot accept is that containers are lost due to shoddy workmanship, or to containers being overloaded or incorrectly stacked, or because of a laissez-faire attitude to this problem by the industry at large.</p>
      <p sl="en">Containers falling off ships are dangerous. Losing 20 000 of them a year is unacceptable. Lives are being put at risk, which is why we are demanding action. The maritime industry seems unwilling to act. Maybe we should.</p>

    <intervention id="4-038" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Máire Geoghegan-Quinn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I am grateful to Mr Simpson for raising this crucial issue which is of interest to many Members of this Parliament and also to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Commission welcomes the results of the Lashing@Sea project. It is primarily the role of the International Maritime Organisation to tackle the issue of containers lost at sea, as this is regulated at an international level. The Commission will nevertheless work together with Member States to promote actions to adopt internationally agreed procedures within the structures of the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="ga">On the second question of overweight and incorrectly stowed containers, there are no EU rules governing the weighing of containers before loading them on ships or procedures covering stowage or lashing. This matter is regulated at national level or through international agreements.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Commission does not plan at this stage to take a legislative initiative concerning this issue. However, this could change if international discussions are not successful and there are increased problems with the stability of ships, the strength of ships or losses of containers.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Before presenting any new proposal, the Commission would need to fully assess the impact such a measure would have on shipping operators. Today the Commission does not have sufficient information concerning this specific matter.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Concerning the third issue of tracking systems to locate containers at sea, this possibility could be further explored. However, equipping millions of containers with tracking devices would be costly and a proper assessment of the benefits must be carried out before taking a final decision to make such tracking systems mandatory.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Commission could also assess the feasibility of clarifying the provisions of Directive 2002/59/EC that established the Community vessel traffic monitoring system and which obliges the Member States to ensure that the master of a ship reports to responsible coastal stations any sight of containers drifting at sea.</p>
      <p sl="ga">If the option to ensure the traceability of the containers is to be explored, the cost of such measures should be taken into account. However, such an option could be considered in the framework of the potential development of the traceability of the containers for logistics and security purposes.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Finally, concerning compensation for the damage caused by lost containers; this can be addressed under Directive 2009/20/EC concerning maritime insurance, and Directive 2005/35/EC concerning maritime pollution and sanctions in the event of offences covers cases when oil-polluting substances have been dumped into the sea.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Directive 2004/35/EC concerning environmental liability also establishes strict liability for operators who cause damage to the environment through the transportation by sea of dangerous goods or polluting goods. Such operators are obliged to remedy the damage caused to protected species and natural habitats.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Additional measures to put in place a compensation regime for damages caused by lost containers would need to be closely assessed against the proportionality principle justifying EU action. The Commission believes that at this stage the work of the IMO to improve standards should be the priority.</p>

    <intervention id="4-040" speaker_id="96885" name="Dominique Riquet" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Simpson pointed out, several thousand containers are lost each year in European waters, and they pose a very significant risk on two counts: they pose a pollution risk, which has been widely discussed, but also, because a number of them do not sink but often float between two bodies of water in which they are difficult to locate, they pose a major risk to the safe passage of ships, whether they be cargo ships or, in particular, the smallest fishing or recreational vessels. The result, as we know, is serious accidents that endanger human lives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is therefore an extremely serious problem, and the Commission seems to be saying that either it does not have the information to act, or it believes that, in view of the existing arrangements, certain measures must be applied. In reality, that is not the case: nothing whatsoever is being done about this situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore want real measures to be proposed. We want preventive measures, by which I mean measures relating to container loading and stowage methods and to the scope to build into containers – and this can be done in satisfactory economic conditions – a beacon that will enable lost containers to be located and, therefore, either avoided by vessels – thus saving human lives – or retrieved if they contain toxic substances. In the event that toxic or highly toxic substances are present, this beacon must also be able to emit an agreed signal to enable the environmental risk to be anticipated and contained.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, this beacon must be of use in identifying the owners of containers, since there is a real issue of liability that has been raised in the oral question. Indeed, not knowing who the owners are and not being able, in fact, to identify and locate containers means that nothing can be established with regard to recovery and compensation for damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We strongly urge the Commission not to just conclude that we do not have the resources or that the existing resources are sufficient, because that is not the case: there is an issue of environmental safety, but there are also lives at stake, and we must remember that.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to second the comments and questions put forward by the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Simpson. The loss of containers – as well as their contents, of course, since we must not forget that we are also talking about that – is without doubt an underestimated and neglected problem. As has been said, this concerns as many as 2 000 containers a year in European waters alone, with all the consequences for the environment, consequences possibly for the crews, for other ships and for the coastal regions, which of course are fairly often left with the task of clearing up the debris. This is therefore an issue that we must tackle.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are various reasons for this problem: bad weather, speed, poor securing and stacking of containers, excessive weight, and so on. My group believes that this problem has a European dimension which justifies an initiative by the Commission. We should not stand back passively and wait for International Maritime Organization (IMO) measures. In particular, initiatives could be taken to register such incidents and raise awareness of this issue in European ports. In the context of the social dialogue – the European social dialogue in the port sector – the Commission could also broach the subject and propose solutions such as new procedures for loading containers or modified training.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr Riquet has emphasised, and I too believe, that it is very wise to ensure that containers are traceable: not only in this context but also in the context of monitoring the entire logistics chain. Commissioner, I therefore expect some slightly more concrete initiatives over the coming months and years.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere, which was received enthusiastically by the residents, has in the past made headline news. In another case, a contingent of rubber ducks floated ashore. These are, of course, the pleasant examples of ships’ cargoes going missing, but the fact is that in many cases lost containers can cause serious damage. It has become clear that we must do something about this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Dutch Government was concerned about this problem and set up an investigation to find out why it was happening. The investigation identified a number of causes. Although there are EU regulations which specify how cargoes should be secured and although all ships have the manual containing the regulations on board, only 46% of ships have their cargoes properly lashed down. This means that we do not need any new rules. You were right about that, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. In many cases, the weight of the cargo has not been correctly balanced. Another reason is that many crews in the short sea shipping sector unlash cargoes before they have reached their destination to speed up the unloading process. Stacking errors can also be a cause of the problem, together with old or damaged equipment. All of this can, of course, have a major impact on the environment. Around 70% of items lost from ships at sea sink to the bottom, but this gives rise to the question of what damage they are causing on the sea bed. A total of 15% of the goods reach land. The remaining 15% float around in the ocean and obviously represent a major hazard for other ships, platforms and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">This means that when accidents happen at sea we must investigate the extent to which containers were involved. Then we need to speak to shipping companies and port operators to ensure that they comply with the regulations. In addition, regular inspections must be made. Two thousand containers really are too many and I think that carrying out feasibility studies would take too long. We must take immediate action, because the situation simply cannot go on as it is.</p>

    <intervention id="4-044" speaker_id="96654" name="Jaroslav Paška" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the EFD Group">
      <p sl="sk">As I see it, the solution to the problem of compensation for damage caused by containers lost at sea lies in having well-organised relations between three parties: the owner of the transported goods, the shipping company and the insurance company.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The operator, the shipping company and the crew in particular are responsible for the security of goods at sea. The crew is also responsible for preventing the containers from falling off or sliding from the vessel into the sea, that is, for compliance with the international regulations in force, and for ensuring the safe shipping of goods in international maritime transport.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In my opinion, the first step we ought to consider while tackling this issue is ensuring compliance with the regulations on securing goods before putting to sea. I think this is the central issue in this matter. Only then should we try to find new, complementary regulations for the transportation of goods. Only after we know the actual starting position and the situation concerning compliance with the regulations should we seek amendments to regulations which are already established for international shipping and, as the case may be, for the European Union too.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, my colleague Brian Simpson has raised very important questions, and I have to say that I am not at all happy with the response I received from the Commissioner. Is she willing or ready to do anything about it as regards the introduction of a law?</p>
      <p sl="ga">This is a hugely important issue and I commend my colleague, Brian Simpson, for raising it because if you look at the statistics things are actually getting worse.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Approximately 50% of the world’s shipping tonnage carries non-toxic substances as bulk goods. There has been a rapid increase in the worldwide container ship fleet – which has grown by 140% from 32.6 million to 78.3 million gross tonnes since 1984 – and the problem needs to be regulated.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There is also a problem in relation to increased speed, because these container carriers travel at a much faster speed than bulk carriers. They are now travelling at speeds of 27 knots, which is a huge speed in terms of the possibility of crashes or impacts, collisions and so on. So there is a huge problem there as well.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Then we have the problem in relation to the actual age of the fleets themselves. When you look at the age of the fleets carrying containers, the bulk of them are in the category of 19-24 years old, which means that there is a major problem from the point of view of actual structural defects. What we need is a legislative initiative. We cannot allow a laissez-faire attitude. What we also need is a strict liability convention, so that ships travelling though EU waters will automatically have to foot the bill for non-intentional toxic releases into the sea due to the loss of containers.</p>
      <p sl="ga">What I am saying in essence is that we need action because the situation is getting progressively worse and, as Mr Simpson has pointed out, in the bulk of cases of accidents we are talking about human error in terms of the way containers are tied down, dealt with and so on, so we really need to take the shipping companies on.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, exactly eight years ago this November, the Prestige, an oil tanker carrying 70 000 tonnes of crude oil, suffered an accident off the coast of Galicia causing a leak through which the tanker spilled 20 000 tonnes of oil. This initial leak, combined with the misjudged decisions of the Minister of Public Works at the time, Mr Álvarez-Cascos, resulted in an absolute disaster and the worst ecological, social and economic tragedy ever to affect the Galician coasts.</p>
      <p sl="es">One of the possible causes considered to explain the leak was precisely the presence of lost containers floating on the sea surface at the mercy of the waves and storms. These containers are potential projectiles that can be thrust against the hulls of all kinds of ships, including oil tankers like the Prestige but also passenger ships, ferries or cruise ships.</p>
      <p sl="es">The outcome of the Lashing@Sea project has revealed serious deficiencies and negligence in the different areas concerned, such as lack of training and instruction among loading personnel and stevedores in the ports and also among the ship crews, which are consistently undertrained and undermanned even though the ships they work on are genuine monsters of the seas.</p>
      <p sl="es">In addition, the best techniques to secure and trace the containers are, on the whole, insufficiently used, and they are frequently overloaded. Lastly, a cost and risk assessment of the new physical effects generated by these monsters of the seas needs to be carried out. These effects include, for example, the so-called ‘parametric resonance effect’, which can cause containers to drop from the rear of the ship at a faster rate.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why we demand that the European Commission undertake immediate preventive measures, more training, instruction and refreshment courses for stevedores and crews. We also demand the implementation of technological safety measures: weight controls in ports, improved lashing equipment and stacking strategies, and adequate marking to locate the containers in case of loss, traceability being one of the services potentially provided by the Galileo project.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am glad that the European Commission did not exist in the 15th century. If it had existed, Christopher Columbus and his companions would probably have sailed in the next container, which would promptly have sunk, and they would never have reached the continent of America.</p>
      <p sl="de">We know what the cause of this problem is. We know that something needs to be done about it. What does the Commission say? It says that it is not possible to do anything. This is simply not acceptable. We know that inaccurate stowage is the cause, that the containers have faulty lashings, that they are overweight, that they fall into the water even when the weather is not stormy and that individual countries with their own regulations cannot change any of this. Who else should be bringing about change, if not the Commission, which is responsible for ensuring that things like this do not happen in European waters.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not only the environmental damage that we are concerned about. Human lives are also being put at risk. What would happen if a small boat with a plastic hull were to ram one of these containers in mid-Atlantic? It would sink. It would not just be the boat itself that would sink, but also the people on board. Spending a long period in the water in the middle of the North Atlantic wearing a life jacket is not much fun. This is something which we need to take into account. Therefore, I think it is wrong that nothing is happening. I believe that the European Commission must introduce regulations as quickly as possible in order to put an end to this situation. It is dangerous, it is wrong and something must be done. I am calling on the Commission to take urgent action, because it is responsible in this case.</p>

Hence, I believe the European Commission must strive to create an insurance fund that can provide compensation for any damage caused by the leakage of what are at times hazardous substances from containers lost at sea.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, it is advisable to raise the maritime safety level through stricter legislation on the control of goods stowage operations and the prevention of the illegal stowage of harmful toxic goods on ships. This insurance fund is something that I have already requested on other similar occasions.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I am grateful to all Members who participated in this debate and I would like to emphasise that I fully understand the importance of the topic we are discussing and how important it is in the opinion of Members that the Commission press ahead with a policy that would resolve this particular matter. I believe that the debate, and all that everyone has contributed, has shown the importance of the affair.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I also believe the debate showed the importance to be attached to the protection of the environment. Interestingly, the debate has gone from Mrs Meissner’s rubber ducks and shoes all the way to Columbus, who folklore says paid a visit to my home port in the west of Ireland. I am very glad that he took that famous voyage!</p>
      <p sl="ga">However, I would like to emphasise again to all of the Members, but in particular to Mr Simpson who has taken such a keen interest in this area and who has put so much work into it, that we are very serious about this particular issue. We are aware of the large increase in the number of containers that are lost and, as I said earlier, Commissioner Kallas is looking at this problem. He believes it is not just linked to the lashing of containers but also to overweight containers. It is also due sometimes to the strength of the ship which was an issue that was raised, and the age of the ships – an issue raised by Mr Higgins.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Safety and protection of the marine environment, as I said earlier, are very important priorities for the Commission. We cannot compromise on those issues and we, and Commissioner Kallas in particular, will certainly consider whether further action is necessary. I am sure he would be very happy to work closely with you and your committee, Mr Simpson, in coming to a conclusion on that.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We already have quite a number of tools at our disposal to ensure safety, as well as the prevention of pollution, including from containers lost at sea. With regard to concrete action on the issue, I believe that action at an EU level does not seem necessary at this stage. However, I do take your point that the IMO as an organisation is moving very slowly and that the Commission needs to get involved to push for quicker solutions.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I still think, and I know that Commissioner Kallas feels very strongly, that the adequate forum to discuss these issues is still the IMO, and I suppose a review of the recent results of the lashing@sea project could be encouraged there.</p>
      <p sl="ga">That project also confirms the importance of having a global approach when we are developing procedures and standards so that we keep this level playing field that we talked about earlier between operators from Member States and indeed other states.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Let me conclude by emphasising that these issues should first be discussed in the IMO. The Commission participates as an observer in the IMO and the Commission prepares positions together with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I can assure you that I will convey the results of the debate here today to Commissioner Kallas and the issue, I know, will be looked at by him and promoted in that context.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to offer my congratulations on the decision to take up the subject of containers lost at sea. On 8 February this year, ferries sailing from Poland to Sweden were in immediate danger. The Finnish freight vessel the Linda was sailing from Rotterdam to St Petersburg, and while crossing lanes used by Polish and Swedish vessels it lost three containers containing 8.3 tonnes of substances classified as dangerous to the environment, 7 tonnes of products which are hazardous to marine life and 5.5 tonnes of flammable substances. Fortunately, this time it was possible to avert a tragedy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I agree that all containers should be weighed in port and correctly stowed before vessels head to sea. This is, however, a long-term plan. The plan for today is for the Commission to introduce a regulation which provides for particular supervision of containers with substances classified as hazardous. Therefore, I would like to ask the Commission a question: when may we expect the first action on this matter?</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0266/2010) by Mrs Meissner, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on integrated maritime policy (IMP) – evaluation of progress made and new challenges (COM(2009)0540 - 2010/2020(INI)).</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, I wish that the Chamber were full to bursting, not on my account or because this is my first report, but because of the subject matter, which is unfamiliar to many people, but nevertheless highly important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hardly anyone has heard of integrated maritime policy, but it is a decisive subject for us all, because it really is true that our future lies in the sea. A total of 70% of the earth’s surface consists of water. Population levels are growing, not in Europe, but throughout the rest of the world and by 2050 they will have reached 9 billion. The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans. Our objective must now be to keep the resources of the seas safe for future generations by means of the integrated maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">So far only 10% of the oceans and their resources have been explored, but we already have 50 000 products which come from the sea. Efforts are now being made to produce energy from the sea and to extract raw materials for medicines, cosmetics and industry. While we are developing our overall maritime policy, it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back, as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing. We have the opportunity to turn the maritime economy into the largest area of growth in our economy as a whole. For this reason, people are talking today not only about green jobs, but also about blue jobs and blue growth. The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea. Green shipping and offshore energy are areas where Europe has extensive expertise which can be developed further. For this reason, we need an integrated approach so that we can achieve all of these objectives with great care.</p>
      <p sl="de">Which individual areas are covered by integrated maritime policy? The first of these areas is transport. Shipping can be described as the powerhouse of European transport, because 95% of global trade and 40% of internal European trade travels by sea, via ports with hinterland connections and logistics. Further growth is being forecast and therefore we must ensure in particular that we can reduce emissions by developing greener ships. The next area is shipbuilding. We have a great deal of expertise in this field, as I have already mentioned. We must make sure that we use this expertise productively to secure existing jobs and create new ones.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, maritime policy also includes fisheries and aquaculture. Fish are not just a source of food. In addition, aquaculture is the area of agriculture and fisheries which is showing the highest levels of growth. It is important for us to be aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea. We have oil and gas pipelines, oil platforms and offshore wind farms and there are already plans to fit tankers with sails so that they can cut their energy consumption by 20% by using wind energy. Wave power is an area with future potential and microalgae, which can be used as biomass, represent an almost unlimited source of energy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the area of research there is a focus on using blue biotechnology to develop medicines. We already have painkillers and anti-malaria drugs and work is currently underway on cancer medicines.</p>
      <p sl="de">Protecting our coasts is an important issue which is also covered by integrated maritime policy. Our coasts are threatened by storm tides and we need to protect them, not only against the tides, but also against oil, piracy and smuggling. In addition, we must deal with the problem of asylum seekers in Italy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally our coasts are also, of course, very popular tourist destinations and we are working on developing a sustainable tourism concept for the coastline.</p>
      <p sl="de">You can see that there are many individual areas involved here, all of which are related to water. The objective of the integrated maritime policy is to develop these areas carefully and in harmony by working together. Many people are not aware of this, but it is hugely important.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union has already achieved a great deal in this respect, but it needs to do even more. For this reason, I have focused in this report not so much on the individual areas, but primarily on what has happened in the last few years since the 2007 Blue Paper was published, what still needs to be developed and what has to be continued. These are the areas which I will mention again briefly in my conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President and honourable Members, I would like to say firstly that my colleague Commissioner Damanaki is in Portugal on behalf of President Barroso today at an important conference on marine affairs and marine policy and she regrets that she cannot be here today.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Let me say first, however, that this debate is proof that maritime policy matters. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, on this very fine report.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Commission very much welcomes this excellent report and its favourable view of our integrated maritime policy. This report is more than a mere stock-taking exercise. It also sets out an ambitious, inclusive and detailed vision for the future of maritime policy. Not for the first time in discussing integrated maritime policies, the Parliament has led by example. The report is the product of admirable, cross-committee cooperation which adds democratic legitimacy to our policy. Moreover, it opens up new horizons, not least with the welcome participation of national and regional parliaments and authorities, to help shape our integrated maritime policy to become a truly operational policy of relevance that will create more jobs and better quality jobs.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The Commission is confident that the policy demands in this report will impact positively on future maritime policy for three important reasons.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Firstly, in taking a forward-looking approach to the maritime dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy and ensuring sustainable growth in maritime sectors and coastal regions.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, they will point the way towards emerging policy objectives where the Commission and Parliament should work together. These include Europe’s approach to climate change mitigation in coastal regions and to sustainable coastal tourism, support for greener, safer and more competitive shipping through the common maritime space without borders, and further action on maritime safety and accident prevention.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Thirdly, this report provides a coherent and constructive set of proposals for future actions.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I very much look forward to hearing the views expressed during this debate.</p>

    <intervention id="4-060" speaker_id="96767" name="Werner Kuhn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Meissner for what is, in the truest sense of the word, integrated work, not only because it concerns the integrated maritime policy, but also because it includes all the specialist areas. As far as fisheries are concerned, I would like to say once again that fisheries and aquaculture, of course, make up a substantial part of the integrated maritime policy. It is important for me also to mention once more that we in the European Union produce around 2 million tonnes of fishery, fish and aquaculture products, but we consume 8 million tonnes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are one of the largest export regions for fishery products in the world. Therefore, we are faced with particular challenges when it comes to protecting our resources. One decisive point in this respect which has already been mentioned is maritime spatial planning. It is important for us to identify where the priorities lie. Fishing grounds and protected areas definitely have a high priority, together with the shipping routes and, of course, in this context, maritime safety. Particular care must be taken in very busy shipping lanes.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have been talking a great deal about renewable energy. The offshore wind farms which are being built in large numbers to generate energy must also be included, from the perspective both of fisheries and of maritime safety. This represents a major challenge. There is one other subject which I would like to bring up in this context. We must promote research and development with regard to fishing methods. The EUR 50 million made available by the Commission will not be enough. I would like to ask you to take this message back with you, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn.</p>
      <p sl="de">The integrated maritime policy will, of course, not come to an end at Europe’s borders. We need to work together with our neighbours. We only need to think about Iceland, the Faroe Islands and what has happened there in recent years, the Mediterranean region, Libya and Egypt which present a major challenge.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, sustainable use of the maritime environment is vital to the sustainability and growth of the whole of Europe, especially countries whose economies are directly linked to the sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">Balanced growth in basic sectors, such as fisheries and aquaculture, energy, transport and tourism, can guarantee citizens’ professional future and income. From a regional development point of view, making use of territorial cohesion as a new basis for further integration of the internal market is of vital importance. For the maritime sector, this means further promoting short sea shipping and ensuring better links between peripheral maritime regions and islands and between them and the mainland and economic centres. This is vital if we are to achieve social, economic and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="el">The innovative approach adopted under the integrated maritime policy is also important and has replaced the fragmented approach to maritime policies. Taking advantage of synergies has a double benefit for the citizens of the European Union: it improves the results obtained and saves money.</p>

    <intervention id="4-062" speaker_id="97011" name="Georgios Koumoutsakos" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="el">Mr President, the integrated maritime policy is vital to the European Union. We need it in order to fully exploit one of Europe’s basic advantages: its strong maritime tradition. The strategic objective of an integrated maritime policy is to strengthen Europe’s leading position in maritime research and technological development, in sectors such as shipbuilding, the exploitation of maritime resources and the development of off-shore energy sources, through better coordination of policies relating to the sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">The integrated maritime policy must support European shipping, which is unrivalled in the world, so that it can play a leading role at international level. That is why we must safeguard the competitiveness of our shipping as a valuable asset; it is very important to Europe. That is why the international solutions adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, which must have a sovereign role, need to be applied at global level.</p>
      <p sl="el">Mrs Meissner’s report quite rightly underlines and analyses the importance of maritime governance, of maritime surveillance and of maritime spatial planning. However, there is a sine qua non to all of this: compliance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. As such, paragraph 25 of the report, in which the European Parliament asks the coastal states of all the maritime basins, especially the Mediterranean, to resolve delimitation issues on the basis of the Law of the Sea Convention, is extremely important. The report highlights the huge importance of Exclusive Economic Zones to Europe. I wish to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her excellent efforts and on the cooperation between us and to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts. At the same time, however, as an ardent advocate of the competitiveness of European shipping, I personally have serious reservations and grave concerns about the amendment which Mrs Meissner tabled a few days ago.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate Mrs Meissner on her report and thank her for all her hard work. We share the approach taken by this report which puts the focus not on the sectoral structure of maritime policy in the individual Member States, but instead emphasises the importance of coordinating maritime policy within and across the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look to the future, we will see the space available in our seas and oceans becoming more restricted. The oceans are transport routes, sources of raw materials and energy, suppliers of foodstuffs and water reservoirs. The economic exploitation of the oceans is growing and this brings an accompanying increase in the environmental impact on them. Conflicts of interest will arise and we will have to resolve them by means of effective coordination within and among countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not possible to comment on every issue, but I would like to mention briefly the sulphur emission control areas. It was not my intention to make the limits less strict. When the Commission presents its study, we will be able to tell to what extent the limits will result in a shift from sea to road transport, in particular in the North Sea and the Baltic. Then we can discuss this issue further. However, the basic conditions for competition within the European Union between the North and the South must remain at the same level. This must also be one of the Commission’s objectives.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one point which we are not entirely happy about. We have been talking for a long time about the strategic importance of the shipbuilding industry in Europe. We have also said that innovation is very important in this industry, because this is the only way that it can survive. We need a coordinated strategy for our policy on the shipbuilding industry. I believe that the call from the Member States to put funding aside for shipbuilding was also very important, but it has not been supported by the Liberals and the Conservatives. Ladies and gentlemen, how do you propose that we should support the shipbuilding industry in Europe? Coming out with platitudes and good wishes for the workers in the European shipyards, who are concerned about their jobs, is simply not enough. We Social Democrats expect better measures and better proposals in this area.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, a third of European citizens live in coastal regions. The EU is the world's largest maritime power. An integrated policy in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy will help us strengthen our leadership.</p>
      <p sl="es">However this requires a global, cross-sectoral policy that takes into account all civil society actors as well as the strategies and responsibilities of local and regional authorities in coastal areas. We must continue to view our coasts and seas as an opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason, we need to strengthen our sustainable fisheries policy, taking on board the difficulties of people who make their living from the sea, who, incidentally, are a highly responsible sector. We have to reinforce the safety policy so that fishing vessels operating under European agreements can be protected. This means fighting piracy and therefore strengthening Operation Atalanta.</p>
      <p sl="es">We have to show our full commitment to the strategically important shipbuilding industry, which is going through hard times due to competition from Southeast Asia and needs and expects solid support from Europe, which is currently amiss.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must develop motorways of the sea to reduce CO2 and further the development of renewable energies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Innovation, inter-institutional coordination, appropriate financial instruments and a clear definition of Europe's strategy in every sector involved will enable us to achieve economic, technical and sustainable development, as well as research to a degree that allows creating high-level jobs and protecting something we all care for and something we all want to keep alive: the sea.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Meissner, for drawing together this report and developing it alongside the other political groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">As 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered with water, it really does make sense to try and develop an integrated maritime policy. Europe, of course, has 305 000 kilometres of coastline.</p>
      <p sl="en">That was the Commission’s intent back in 2009 when it announced a more horizontal policy approach on areas such as maritime transport, the marine environment and regional and fisheries policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today we see the response of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to this fresh direction, in the shape of Mrs Meissner’s report. We will be supporting this report. It is a useful step in the right direction towards caring for, and the sustainable use of, our maritime resource.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we believe there is still much work to be done. We welcome the report’s suggestions on maritime governance, on sea basin initiatives and strategies, on maritime spatial planning and surveillance, a maritime research framework and observation and data network, and a fund for maritime infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am particularly pleased that the report now includes the integration of carbon emission reduction targets and support for renewable solar and wind energies on board vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to the votes later on today, I would particularly like to ask Members to support the rapporteur’s amendment which seeks to include the option of including emission trading schemes in the EU and IMO rules.</p>
      <p sl="en">This was an issue over which the Committee on Transport was evenly split, with 20 votes each side, so it is perfectly right that Mrs Meissner has brought it here today for plenary to vote on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would ask Members to show some ‘20-20 vision’ and vote for the rapporteur’s amendment, which recognises that these measures sit squarely alongside our wider strategic objectives around CO2 reduction and the Europe 2020 project.</p>

I do not, however, support the resurrection of the concept of a European coastguard. This was rejected once before. I do not believe it is necessary. I believe it is far too expensive at a time of financial stringency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also believe that a directive on maritime spatial planning would be an unnecessary luxury which would not, in my view, add value to the current process of cooperation between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I also mention in this context the impact of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy projects, together with the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs), on inshore and artisanal fisheries? We cannot simply draw lines on maps designating vast areas of inshore waters as MPAs or for renewable energy. Small-scale fishermen cannot be arbitrarily displaced without full consultation. The designation of such areas must be a bottom-up and not a top-down process, and it must involve stakeholder consultation.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The Integrated Maritime Policy is not being discussed in the context of the European Union for the first time, but it is still very difficult to reconcile the protection of the environment, fisheries, transport, energy, industry, science and research and to embed the various aspects of development into a single plan. The Commission’s report answers the question of how the action plan contained in the Blue Book from 2007 is to be implemented. It emerges from the report that 56 out of 65 proposed measures have been initiated or completed, and generally as legal acts by the Commission or Council.</p>
      <p sl="cs">For inland regions, however, the priority is to connect maritime policy with a policy of better, rational use of the main European waterways; see point 40 of the report. Here, attention is traditionally focused on the Rhine, the Maas and the associated system of waterways in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, including the Rhine – Main – Danube link. Unfortunately, the central section of the Danube downstream of Vienna and the tributaries of the Elbe upstream of Magdeburg have been left in the shadows by these efforts. The use of these waterways for traffic is discussed far less often, and investment in improving navigability is of peripheral interest to the European Commission and Council. This is definitely a shame, because the great energy potential of these waterways remains unused, while unnecessary pressure is put on the expansion of terminals in port cities, which transfer cargo from ship to rail and road while river ports have idle capacity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Of course, in addition to connecting ship, rail and road traffic, it is necessary to fundamentally address issues of nature conservation and energy use in coastal regions. Here it is reasonable to provide additional questions to the ones that Mrs Meissner put in her report, on two other issues: the relationship of maritime and river transport, and connecting them.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I welcome the dozens of measures contained in the report. I would emphasise the need for consistent application of the third maritime package. In point 21, I consider the work on ecological solutions to the cleaning of oil tankers and the disposal of old ships to be a key initiative to avoid pollution. The current status of this issue is pathetic. I agree with the report by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Meissner for a well-thought-out and comprehensive report, to which there is scarcely anything to add. Like Mrs Meissner, I am a strong supporter of coherence between policy areas, interdisciplinary research programmes and new challenges, but what concerns me most of all are the problems relating to the pollution of our seas.</p>
      <p sl="da">We adopt so many reports in this House that they are, unfortunately, forgotten soon after they have been adopted. I would therefore like to remind the Commission of an additional protocol that Parliament adopted on 26 January this year, in other words nearly nine months ago. It concerned the establishment of cooperation between EU Member States for combating disasters in the North-East Atlantic. This is a subject that Mrs Meissner also mentions in paragraph 4 of her report. To this day, I have not received any feedback from the Commission on this subject, either with regard to whether any steps have been taken towards the establishment of such cooperation or preparedness amongst Member States, or whether the Commission itself perhaps intends to establish a state of preparedness for the EU. All of this is despite the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that we have only just finished dealing with and the threat posed by the far too old and rusty oil wells in the North Sea. So, I would now – once again – like to ask the Commission: What has happened with regard to the disaster preparedness for our seas? Will we have to wait for something serious to happen first before Europe wakes up?</p>

    <intervention id="4-069" speaker_id="96981" name="Franz Obermayr" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, as far as our oceans are concerned, time is running out. If we continue to destroy them at the current rate, we will ultimately destroy ourselves, because 70% of the world’s oxygen is produced by marine flora. It is not enough to promote the protection of the environment within the EU, as we are always so keen to do, because it is a well-known fact that wind and waves are no respecters of borders.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I really do not understand why we are not putting clear regulations in place, when rich industrial nations are able to shift their environmental problems to the developing countries. I think we need specific regulations for ship breaking. Ships consisting of tonnes of waste polluted with asbestos are sent from Europe to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan to be broken up, where they contaminate whole stretches of coastline. However, this all comes back to us in the form of contaminated seafood, which ends up on our plates via the food chain. We have not even mentioned the workers in these countries who risk their lives as a result of inadequate safety precautions. A day, a ship, a death. This is how the shipbreakers in the Indian town of Alang describe their dangerous job.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also have no clear regulations for deep sea drilling. In this context, I would like to highlight the very positive move made by Mr Öttinger, who is attempting to put in place regulations governing the safety of drilling platforms.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are no regulations for busy shipping lanes, such as the Bosphorus, where compulsory pilotage has not yet been introduced. Large tankers pass through these straits every day.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another positive feature that I would like to mention is the fact that shipping companies are playing an active role in protecting the environment and marine animals. For example, an Italian shipping firm has installed a system which will prevent its ships from colliding with whales. It would be a very good idea for the EU to support positive measures of this kind taken by private companies.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work, and especially for the proper way in which she views the International Maritime Organisation’s decision on sulphur emissions. I hope that the Commission will actually take this decision into account, one that today is bound to be adopted unanimously in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The IMO’s decision was a hasty one, with no assessment of environmental impact and no estimates of costs. The EU should not repeat the IMO’s mistake. If different emissions limits are set for the north compared with the south, competition will be distorted and so will the rules within the EU. The emissions limits must be the same. I am absolutely certain that it will be contrary to EU competition law if this goes ahead.</p>
      <p sl="fi">What will this mean for my country, for example? It will mean that industry will face an additional bill of approximately EUR 1 billion a year. Finnish jobs are at risk, even though we are doing all we can here to increase the number of jobs in the EU. We speak of the Europe 2020 strategy, but we make other sorts of decisions that take these jobs away.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Cargo for Finland is transferred to Russian ships, which then take the goods to Finland on trucks, because Russia is not going to ratify this decision by the IMO. This can hardly be what the EU wants. The Swedes have said that they will start to transport by truck what now goes by ship. We would therefore be making a bad decision for the environment and a bad decision for future European jobs. I hope that the Commission actually understands this decision, which is being taken unanimously in Parliament today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur. When it comes to integrated maritime policy, we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the European Union, making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters, and in the fight against climate change and pollution.</p>
      <p sl="it">Only this morning Mr Pirillo reminded Parliament of yet another catastrophic event that occurred the other day in the town of Paola, in Calabria. The Commission must prove that it is making a real effort, that it is not just using its instruments of governance but actually implementing targeted legislative measures, and duly learning its lessons from past mistakes caused by an approach that was often too sectoral in nature.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are fully aware that this is a very complex process, but we are at a difficult and demanding juncture where no lapse in attention can be tolerated and where adequate investment and shared governance mechanisms are needed both at interinstitutional level and in international cooperation for the regional basins, among which the Mediterranean stands out because of the complexity of its jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why it will be crucial to view the management of the Mediterranean basin as an asset shared by all the coastal States, on the basis of the res communis omnium , or common heritage, principle. Otherwise, the increasingly widespread practice of unilaterally declaring exclusive economic zones or the like in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as running counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would undermine the idea of effective, shared governance.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would point out in this respect that, only a month ago, this interpretation on the part of Libya resulted in an actual armed assault on a European fishing boat, and it would be wrong to argue that this is just a matter between Italy and Libya.</p>

This report gives us the opportunity to project ourselves into the future, and the situation being as it is today, this is very important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are absolutely determined to see two things in integrated maritime policy (IMP). Firstly, that priority is given to the preservation of the marine and coastal environment. A framework directive already exists, but other instruments need to be enhanced, especially as regards integrated coastal zone management and maritime spatial planning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must take advantage of the next three years in order to establish a real Community policy in this area that will enable us to bridge this artificial divide between instruments for the land and instruments for the sea, or else our fellow citizens will not understand. We are therefore expecting a great deal of Mrs Damanaki on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point is blue growth. We are all very attached to it, and we expect the study initiated by the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries to clarify the sources of activity and of employment that we can expect.</p>

      <p sl="sv">The Integrated Maritime Policy is a very welcome strategy, because our seas are interconnected and all sectors that exploit the seas have a combined effect on the marine environment. This means that it would be devastating and irresponsible to continue to take decisions relating to the marine environment without taking account of the cumulative effect on the marine environment of fishing, dredging, shipping, wind and wave power, tourism and other activities.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Marine Strategy Framework Directive forms the environmental pillar of the Integrated Maritime Policy and it states that all Member States shall have attained a good environmental status for our seas by 2020. If this is to be possible, the Member States must, as soon as possible, implement a form of maritime governance that is integrated in practice, with a single centre for decision making.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I will give you an example of how wrong things can go when the various users of the sea are governed by different authorities and different laws. In the southern Kattegatt in Sweden, Sweden and Denmark have agreed to protect the spawning ground of the cod in a desperate attempt to protect the last remaining cod stocks. Recently, another authority in Sweden decided that the municipality of Falkenberg should be permitted to dump enormous quantities of dredging waste from ports into the sea, precisely in the spawning ground of the cod.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Member States now have a duty to attain a good environmental status for the seas by 2020. Only by collating the decisions affecting the seas and carrying out marine spatial planning will this be possible.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Marine spatial planning will also allow us to see more clearly who has an interest in the seas, who wishes to exploit the seas and to be clear that the same rules must apply to everybody. Fishing operations must also carry out environmental impact assessments, and they must follow the best practice principle. They must also comply with the precautionary principle, exactly like gas pipelines on the sea floor or wind farms do.</p>

The short presentation of the report pursuant to Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, the reduced possibility to table amendments, which is against the rules, and the rejection of most amendments tabled by the European Commission do not fill us with optimism or hope that the Committee on Transport and Tourism will approach the subject of integrated maritime policy in a fully responsible way.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us remember that the maritime industry in the European Union finds itself in a huge crisis. The industry is being destroyed by dumping and competition from the Far East and by the taking over of shipping companies by cheap operators. This is happening as a result of the lack of a European integrated maritime policy. We are facing a crisis in the shipbuilding industry. I will add that in my country the two largest shipyards have recently been closed, and that this took place under the influence of pressure from the European Commission and in the face of the ineffective action of the Polish Government. This has caused huge economic migration and has increased unemployment. Therefore, I appeal for appropriate attention to be given to integrated maritime policy and for a fully responsible approach to the subject.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The large number of activities and sectoral policies on the marine environment – from fishing to maritime transport, and including tourism, energy, science and technology, among others – requires an integrated policy that promotes a beneficial interlinking of all these areas within a framework of sustainability of the marine environment, and of preservation of the related ecosystems. This is because specific local and regional features are of crucial importance within this relationship, and the effects of this integrated policy will be felt at this level too. Beyond simply being implemented, it must also be defined at this level, involving the coastal communities that work with the marine environment, who bring it to life and depend on it. We must also not forget the joint vision that is necessary or the collaboration and cooperation that are crucial in view of the fact that the oceans and seas are interlinked and interdependent.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Any Union initiative in this area must safeguard the sovereignty and powers of each Member State with regard to the management of its territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones, while at the same time contributing to promoting the resources that are present there as part of their endogenous potential and their comparative advantages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Amongst other things, such as the promotion of marine research and the development of the various aspects of maritime technology and engineering, such as shipbuilding, a comprehensive vision of an integrated maritime policy must cover the following: the promotion of maritime transport that is more environmentally sustainable and of port infrastructure as part of their public management; promotion of fishing ensuring the modernisation of the sector and its environmental sustainability and socioeconomic viability; adequate and independent funding that does not take resources away from the European Fisheries Fund; and finally, the role and special characteristics of the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, before taking advice from any expert it is wise to examine their record to check that they are competent. The Integrated Maritime Policy report is partly the work of the Committee on Fisheries, so before buying into its grand schemes it is worthwhile taking a critical look at the European Union’s record on the management of the seas. Inevitably, this means assessing the situation in the former sovereign UK waters, secretly betrayed to European bureaucracy control in 1973, since nearly 70% of so-called ‘EU fishing stocks’ are actually British fishing stocks.</p>
      <p sl="en">How have our fish and our fishermen fared under the common fisheries policy (CFP)? The figures tell us far more than all the fine words in this report. 88% of the EU’s stocks are overfished, against a global average of about 27%. 30% of our fish species are now officially outside safe biological limits, because there are too few adult fish left for normal reproduction. Under the CFP’s obscene quota system, nearly a million tonnes of fish are discarded dead into the North Sea alone every year. Meanwhile, the industrial hoovering-up of species such as sand eels has led to crashing populations of bird species such as puffins.</p>
      <p sl="en">To Europe’s south, the picture is just as bad. West African fishermen, whose lifestyle had been sustained for generations, are being forced to switch to people trafficking because EU-registered vessels have helped fish their waters to extinction.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is time for the EU to acknowledge that its record in maritime management is the worst in the entire world, a typical example of what is known as the tragedy of the commons – the phenomenon by which shared resources always get exploited ruthlessly, because anyone who exercises restraint is disadvantaged by the unscrupulous.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is time to restore control of the seas and fishing grounds to the sovereign nations, whose track record has shown them fit to exercise such stewardship. In the case of the two-thirds of EU waters that the EU has fished to extinction, that means the British nation and British fishermen.</p>

      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided that all the seas should be protected in a similar way, arguing that any other solution would bring about a situation of unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="es">We accept the position of the majority in favour of a legal situation with uniform rules for the entire Union, although I will not spare Members the fact that such a solution also clearly implies a certain degree of unfairness.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is obvious that the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel are more polluted and, in my view, sulphur monitoring will have to be stricter.</p>
      <p sl="es">The measures to reduce transport time and handling costs in ports are certainly positive initiatives. Nonetheless, I will repeat this again and again: we still have work to do on this matter. Unless we liberalise our ports resolutely, they will not be able to expand the key role they will be required to play in the context of co-modality.</p>

      <p sl="es">In this respect, the Commission is urged to judge whether it is necessary, within the framework of revision of the Regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to strengthen the role of the Agency in carrying out preventive inspections and post-hydrocarbon-spill clean-up tasks.

As coordinator of my group, I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our former colleague Mr Piecyk, who sadly died two years ago and who did some groundbreaking work in this Parliament to flesh out an integrated European maritime policy – something we can build upon today.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Clearly this is a complex sector with many aspects and we will therefore have much to do to achieve our goal. To begin with, we must bring about a new dynamism in the sector by putting effective structures and appropriate measures in place; after all, this sector provides large numbers of jobs throughout Europe both directly and indirectly and, in particular, is essential for the development of our coastal and port areas.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The structure has already been referred to, and that also includes European structures. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) must really be strengthened and given a greater role, and be given the appropriate competences and resources. The issue of the oil disaster and oil drilling has also been raised. As far as that is concerned, I believe that it should be clear that any subsequent amendment of the competences should strengthen EMSA’s position. EMSA should also be playing a major role in promoting cooperation between national inspection services, coastal monitoring services and so on in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, there are of course some major environmental challenges. Shipping creates more pollution than it needs to. There is, therefore, still much scope for improvement. We are talking about sulphur standards, which should be the same everywhere, and about a system of emissions trading – and I call upon the Commission to really keep up the pressure within the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in this regard. In addition, we need to have effective spatial planning, of course.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, integrated maritime policy is a forward-looking area. The oceans are being used increasingly intensively for transport, maritime economic activities, offshore energy and fishing, and the development of these areas must be coordinated. The space available is limited and, therefore, the various maritime sectors must take a responsible and thoughtful approach to working together. The use and the protection of the seas must not conflict with one another. These two areas are mutually dependent, because the oceans can only support us if they are healthy. I would like to highlight the positive cooperation between countries bordering on the Baltic who are working together to promote the dynamic development of the fisheries, the environment, the infrastructure and tourism in coastal regions. We must continue to focus on the fishing industry, which is in a weak position and is often regarded as being a low priority, but which, because it provides us with food, represents a vital link in the coastal economy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I believe that the report clearly demonstrates the challenges posed by the marine environment in terms of fisheries, aquaculture, transport, tourism, energy, mining and biological resources, and climate change research. There is considerable potential for development, and it should be safeguarded, protected and enhanced in a lasting way, because the future of the human race depends on it. The report also rightly notes that the European Union is the world’s leading maritime power and that its outermost regions ensure that it has the world’s largest exclusive economic zone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in the light of such a finding, it is the European Union’s responsibility to implement an ambitious policy, a major maritime policy. If the world’s leading maritime power does not do so, who will? It must be said, however, that the resolution does not go very far in this direction. One cannot claim to be the world’s leading policymaker with only EUR 50 million.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, although the outermost regions have a recognised strategic position due to their presence in every ocean, it would have been sensible to make them play a leading role in a major strategy for the oceans.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the oceans and seas represent 70% of the planet’s surface, they were the birthplace of life, and throughout human history they have been a source of food through fishing, as well as a means of communication between peoples and cultures via maritime trade. That is where we find the origin of the concept of traditional maritime activities: fishing and transport.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The sea is currently gaining a new role in the context of the global world, as a geostrategic and geopolitical stage that gives Europe a central role. Moreover, we are currently living in the so-called period of new uses for the oceans, such as the exploitation of its energy, mineral and genetic resources, which, as along with fishing and maritime transport, require a holistic perspective and concerted action; as a matter of fact, Mrs Meissner has sought to give an impression of this, for which I warmly congratulate her.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is essential for the European Union to plan the European maritime space and its uses, especially for coastal regions and even more so for the outermost regions. For the integrated maritime policy to be greater than the sum of its parts – and to focus on fishing here – it is vital that this activity be represented in the clusters of maritime activities, so that desires can be incorporated in a collaborative way and difficulties resulting from the overlapping of interests in the use of the maritime space can be overcome.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this area, in order to comply with the decisions reached at the 2002 Johannesburg Summit, it is imperative to protect the marine biogeographical regions that are most sensitive from a biological viewpoint and to promote sustainable fishing using increasingly selective methods. It is, therefore, important to guarantee the creation of cross-sectoral political instruments that bring together the different sectors of the various maritime activities, defending their respective requirements and specific features in terms of utilisation of the maritime sphere.</p>

Today, the Treaty of Lisbon imposes new policies and tools to minimise conflicts, promote dynamic synergies and eliminate unfair competition, in order to protect the environment and create jobs. The integrated maritime policy requires a cross-sectoral, global strategy for the sustainable development of coastal and island areas and the seas.</p>
      <p sl="el">A basic tool for the rational delimitation of uses of the sea is cross-border maritime spatial planning. We must encourage the adoption of single, integrated maritime governance structures at regional level and the development of strategies for the Union’s maritime macro-regions. We need to look into the prospect of creating a European coastguard for efficient integrated maritime surveillance.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, maritime transport plays a fundamental role in trade. As a result, we must encourage cooperation between small and large ports that face one another in the same sea basin and which can facilitate more fluid trade.

Mr Itälä and Mr Fleckenstein have already referred to this. I would like to call on Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn to evaluate the study which is being drawn up very carefully. We do not want to move transport from the sea back to the roads and we want fair competition in northern Europe, in the European Union and in the Mediterranean area. That is one of the fundamental requirements.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of maritime safety, I would also like to say that it should play a greater role in integrated maritime policy with regard to the very busy shipping lanes and straits. For example in the Kadet Trench and in the Bosphorus, as one of my fellow Members has mentioned, there should in future be compulsory pilotage. Where large tankers pass through and highly complex cargoes are being transported, compulsory pilotage would increase levels of maritime safety.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the development of an integrated maritime policy is of vital importance to the Irish, the European and indeed the global economy. As an island-based economy, maritime transport is the cornerstone of Irish industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over 99%, and I repeat 99%, in volume terms of all Irish trade is transported by sea. It is estimated that the Irish marine industrial base is responsible for the employment of some 8 000 people generating over EUR 1.5 billion within the economy annually.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sector connects the Irish economy with the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. The sector is strategically vital to my country and to the recovery of the Irish economy. The rapidly evolving nature of the maritime sector requires a unified approach at European level, and the growth in maritime activities such as maritime transport, development, aquaculture and tourism – combined with new uses of the sea such as underwater technologies, offshore renewable energy and the blue biotech – is increasing pressure on an already limited maritime space.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the integrated maritime policy is a cross-cutting, regional and sectoral policy and the fisheries and aquaculture policy must be a part of it, in a way that does not make it subordinate to other policies. We must all address the environmental and economic problems affecting society as a whole and the fisheries sector in particular: new technologies, fishing gear, development of species, a maritime economy programme to create more and better jobs, quality supplies, international relations aimed at preventing piracy and favouring the governance of the sea, which is devoid of barriers, and not having any sustainability problems, as in the case of Iceland.</p>

      <p sl="it">Integrated maritime policy does not provide for monitoring of the boundaries of international territorial waters for illegal fishing or the crossing of those boundaries. I hope that serious consideration will be given to this aspect within the context of the funds earmarked for implementing this policy, and that those funds will help strengthen controls thanks to modern surveillance systems such as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) services.</p>
      <p sl="it">The horizontal aspect that characterises integrated maritime transport will be guaranteed – I hope with the forthcoming funding package – by the EU budget and not by the fisheries resources, which are used for specific actions.

      <p sl="es">I am particularly grateful for two specific amendments. The first is the one in which the Commission is urged to improve the working conditions of maritime workers and finally transpose into EU law the International Labour Organization (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention. The amendment also includes a proposal for a qualification and training programme for seafarers, which will specifically provide for the recruitment of young people and the inclusion of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am also grateful for the amendment in which we call on the Commission to help Member States in implementing a localisation and mapping programme for underwater shipwrecks and relics, which are part of Europe’s historical and cultural heritage –I come from Spain, a country with a large amount of relics off its coasts. This programme will facilitate the understanding and study of this underwater heritage and help to prevent looting, thus enabling its proper preservation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I know that at the beginning of the debate Mrs Meissner expressed her disappointment at so few Members being here in the Chamber. I think she should be very pleased that 37 speakers contributed to the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, we had a very lively debate which has thrown up fresh ideas to encourage us to aim even higher in terms of the maritime policies that we pursue. We must manage the finances of the EU concerning maritime issues in the context of the European Commission’s proposal for a regulation to finance the integrated maritime policy in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The purpose of the proposed funding, namely of EUR 50 million, is to continue the work undertaken since 2007 to remove policy barriers and to unleash synergies by bridging all policies that impact on the sea, such as transport, fisheries, customs and marine environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission looks forward to working with Parliament on the timely entry into force of this regulation so that we can implement our future integrated maritime policy actions. Furthermore, maritime surveillance is an important new initiative, which is set to engineer a huge change in all future actions by maritime authorities at sea and aims to install a common information-sharing environment for the EU maritime domain.</p>
      <p sl="en">The communication from the Commission concerning this initiative came out only yesterday. It is the culmination of intensive work that has produced a six-step roadmap to achieve in a short time the integration in maritime surveillance which seemed extremely difficult to achieve just a few months ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">I turn now to a number of specific questions raised. On sulphur emissions, the Commission is fully aware of the concerns expressed by industry groups about the impacts that may occur due to the new marine fuel quality standards adopted by the IMO in 2008. That is why the Commission has called for – and subsequently hailed – the IMO agreement which is now estimated to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide by up to 90% and, most importantly, emissions of secondary particulate matter by up to 80%.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will present a proposal to align EU legislation with the IMO decision within the next months. The proposal will be accompanied by a detailed report that will also include the outcome of our ex-post impact assessment relating to the IMO decision, as well as possible measures that the Commission could take to mitigate undesired impacts on the sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr de Grandes Pascual raised the issue of sea basins. The EU is aware of different situations in sea basins and is developing appropriate strategies for each sea basin, tailored to specific needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Ms Rosbach and others raised the issue of an anti-disaster scheme. The European Maritime Safety Agency is in charge of monitoring shipping safety. At present it does not have legal competence to regulate in the area of environmental disasters, but discussions are under way – within the context of the Commission extending or renewing the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency at present – as to whether more powers should be given to the Agency in coming years. Of course, Parliament will be centrally involved in this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in my capacity as the European Commissioner with responsibility for research, innovation and science, I was very glad to hear several Members here in the Chamber raising the issue of the relationship between maritime policy generally and, specifically, research into marine and maritime policy. Last week, the Belgian Presidency organised a very important conference in Ostend which dealt specifically with this issue and brought together scientists involved in this area. This is a very important pillar of our integrated maritime policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Mrs Meissner again for her comprehensive and far-reaching report. I believe that we can now pursue the implementation of all future maritime initiatives with renewed vigour and confidence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you and my apologies to the interpreters if I was speaking too quickly.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think it is good that you have been counting, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn. I did not know how many speeches had been made, but 37 really is a lot. I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today. Right at the beginning, I also forgot to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. We really have worked together very constructively and I enjoyed it very much. I have covered a lot of subjects in the report, because it is very important to me to have a convincing majority in this crucial area.</p>
      <p sl="de">Many of the speeches on different subjects have highlighted the fact that we need joint action on research, planning, implementation and control of maritime activities by means of joint governance, spatial planning and monitoring. This is what the report is all about. However, it is a very varied subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should now like to discuss a few of the speeches. Mr Fleckenstein raised the problem of the sulphur emissions. We have included it in the report because it was important to us that there is no distortion of competition, but we also need to make sure that shipping is more environmentally friendly. However, what you said about shipbuilding, Mr Fleckenstein, is not quite true. It is not the case that the Liberals and the Conservatives did not want to include this. It was simply a question of how we should implement it, of whether we should create a new fund at a European level for refitting old ships or whether we should put in place a strategy. That is the current wording.</p>
      <p sl="de">The subject of my amendment was also raised, which I introduced in order to include emissions trading in the report. In the committee it was rejected by a very small margin, but in my opinion we are all convinced that we must continue to follow this route. For this reason, I am hoping for support in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Kohlíček, you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together, but I know that this is possible. A group of stakeholders and business people from all the different maritime areas meets twice a year to share ideas. These are prominent players at a European level and they all very much value the opportunity to come together.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point concerns the reference to the fact that there are so many different regions. I have included the position of islands in the report and it is not true that this has been omitted. The only area not covered by the strategies is the North Sea. I live closest to the North Sea and, therefore, I wanted to mention that when we talk about the Black Sea, the Mediterranean and the Danube, we should not forget the North Sea.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally I would like to express my thanks, in particular for the remark that we should take moral responsibility for the sea and for future generations. This is why I have chosen the title ‘We need a new awareness of the sea’. If we continue to work on this, we will be able to achieve a great deal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is important for the EU to ensure that its coasts are protected. It is also necessary for the legislation in force to make oil exploration and extraction safer.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Lisbon-based European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) provides support and technical assistance for drawing up and applying Union legislation on maritime safety and protection, as well as on pollution caused by ships.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In June of this year, I submitted a written suggestion to Commissioners Oettinger, Kallas and Georgieva to extend the mandate of the EMSA to create mechanisms for supervising safety on European oil platforms located in the North Sea, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and to make it responsible for preventing environmental disasters related to oil exploration. This suggestion enables an economy of scale at the level of financial, human and technical resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I welcome the Commissioners’ response, which demonstrated openness to reviewing the EMSA regulations, expanding its mandate as regards intervention in maritime pollution incidents.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is well known, the International Maritime Organisation has imposed, under MARPOL Annex VI, various requirements on the amount of sulphur in different regions. The Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the English Channel have been declared a sulphur emissions control area, and more stringent requirements have been established for these regions to reduce pollution significantly. In these regions, from 2015, marine fuels can be used if their sulphur content does not exceed 0.1%, while for other regions the sulphur content is required not to exceed 0.5% from 2020. This issue was also dealt with at the International Maritime Conference, which took place on 24 September in Tallinn in my home country. I believe that it will not be a solution if the European Union comes out with its own requirements, but they do not apply to third countries; that is, we will subject ourselves to unequal competition in the maritime sector. The situation must be resolved internationally, so that the requirements imposed would be real and would apply to all those sailing in the Baltic Sea, not only to vessels from EU Member States. In addition, the imposition of irrational standards involves moving the transportation of goods from the sea back on to the roads, which is much more dangerous and hostile to the environment. On this issue, I therefore support the standpoints of the Estonian and Finnish governments, as well as the European Community Shipowners’ Association – the International Maritime Organisation’s decision should be reviewed and should impose equal rules on all EU regions and vessels operating there.</p>

      <p sl="en">In my capacity as rapporteur on EU Strategy for the Black Sea, I noticed with regret that matters related to the Black Sea are almost ignored in the Union’s integrated maritime policy (IMP). Though the Black Sea was included in the IMP concept in 2007, concrete EU action on this dimension seems to lag behind. I strongly urge the European Commission to redouble efforts to develop the Black Sea approach of this policy. IMP is an important tool for addressing opportunities and challenges in EU sea basins in a coherent manner which is aimed at comprehensive development of the coastal zones. I am deeply convinced that the Black Sea, as a sea partially within the EU, and its littoral States have an acute need for proper application of this tool. The international dimension of the IMP is a crucial aspect for successful implementation in the Black Sea region, which also encompasses seven non-EU countries. The European Parliament is currently preparing a report on establishing an EU Strategy for the Black Sea. I hope that the Commission will follow this initiative and will regard the future strategy as an important basis for strengthened IMP implementation in the Black Sea area.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Following a substantial debate today involving very wide and deep discussions, the Conference of Presidents decided to award the 2010 Sakharov Prize for the freedom of thought to Mr Guillermo Fariñas.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Guillermo Fariñas is an independent journalist and political dissident. He was ready to sacrifice and risk his own health and life as a means of pressure to achieve change in Cuba. He used hunger strikes to protest and to challenge the lack of freedom of speech in Cuba, carrying the hopes of all those who care for freedom, human rights and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I hope to present the award to him in person here in Strasbourg in December, which would be a tremendous moment for the European Parliament and for all Cuban prisoners of conscience.</p>

However, I think that awarding the Sakharov Prize to a Cuban for the third time in its 20-odd-year history is a lot, and we are sending out a political signal that devalues the Sakharov Prize.

      <p sl="pl">Thank you very much, Madam President. In that case, I will start again. In recent years, the European Union economy has often suffered because of crises and financial instability both at local and global levels. In order to prevent similar dangerous situations in the future, pre-prepared support plans must exist, and there must be an appropriate reaction both before and after the problem. The Instrument for Stability fills this role very well.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Financial and technical support should also include the promotion of human and economic development as well as consultations in the event of the violation of human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms. I also support the position of the rapporteur on improvement of the strategic planning sector. This is particularly important in the prevention of social conflicts and in the creation of the External Action Service.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the Commission’s proposal to review the European standardisation system in order to correct its deficiencies and create a proper balance among the European, national and international dimensions. We need a system that contributes to European innovation and sustainable development, increases the competitiveness of the European Union, and strengthens its position in international trade. I would also like to add that although SMEs are fundamental parts of the European market, I believe that they do not participate in the standardisation system sufficiently, therefore they are not able to take full advantage of the benefits of standardisation. The improvement of their representation and participation in the system may be of fundamental importance in the future. The unifying nature of European standardisation improves the efficiency of the internal market, and, at the same time, emphasises the European Union’s role as an economic and political partner on the world market.</p>

Today Moldova is an independent state, which admittedly has many problems, but which is following the road to European integration. Today once again I would like to call on the whole of Moldova’s political class, its political elite, all of its democratic political forces and national minorities to reject counterproductive confrontation, and to develop a culture of consensus and political compromise. I think they should offer society an inclusive vision of the Republic of Moldova, whose objective is European Union Membership for the Republic of Moldova. In the resolution we also speak about Transnistria, the frozen conflict. Transnistria must be high on the EU agenda and all countries, including Russia, must respect Moldova’s territorial integrity.

In particular I would like to draw attention to the economic and social importance simply because the European Union has 320 000 km of sea coast and a third of our citizens – and the trend is rising – live on the coast.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if any of our constituents felt a ‘twitch in the force’ yesterday afternoon, it was because of the extraordinary coincidence of timing that, at the very moment when the British Chancellor of the Exchequer was on his feet in the House of Commons announcing the most severe spending reductions that my country has known since the 1920s, we in this Chamber were voting through increases in the European budget which will cost the United Kingdom taxpayer GBP 880 million. That is not our share of the budget. That is our share of the increase. Since we announced yesterday 490 000 job losses in the public sector, it is perhaps worth quantifying that sum in terms of public sector appointments. It would have paid for 15 000 National Health Service doctors, for 30 000 nurses, for 35 000 police officers or for 50 000 army privates.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is not just Britain. All of our Member States are looking to make reductions in their national budgets and yet the European Union budget keeps expanding, soaking up their savings. If only the hunger of this Chamber for new powers were matched by its interest in exercising properly the powers it already has – above all to hold the executive to account and to keep spending under control. Our voters deserve better of us.</p>

The situation varies across the different Member States. For instance in my country Lithuania maternity leave plus parental leave last up to two years, but other Member States have a minimum amount of maternity leave, therefore I believe that the threshold we set yesterday is a very important achievement.

      <p sl="fi">I think that we have a good system in my country, Finland. If they adopted the system that we agreed on yesterday there, the position of women in the labour market would be substantially weaker, because employers would have to continue to agonise over whether they could take young women on, because the costs of maternity leave would increase significantly.

      <p sl="fi">Newborn children are Europe’s real capital. Mothers, children and families are the trinity on which the future will be built. Obviously too, mothers should not have to suffer financially if they want to have children, and the female-dominated sectors should not either. Women must also have rights when it comes to pay. We should be idealistic, however. We should have faith. This was a moral decision in favour of women, in favour of new life, and in favour of a new Europe.</p>

As a young father, I was present at the birth of both my children and I have to say that I do not know why I would have needed a holiday then, because I did not give birth, my wife did. This is all about maternity leave and we have included fathers. It is difficult point. Nevertheless, it is important for young women to have the opportunity to have a child and then to return to their professional life. I believe that this will be possible under the new system. Although I would personally have preferred 18 weeks, I did eventually vote in favour of 20 weeks in the final vote.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must now ask ourselves whether this will bring more justice and more children in Europe. Family policy in Europe is an issue for the future.

The implementation of the Instrument for Stability reinforced the EU’s potential to respond to crisis or emerging crisis situations. With this in mind I believe that the Commission – while respecting the undertakings that have been made, namely with regard to promoting stable conditions for human and economic development and promoting human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms as the main objectives of the European Union’s external action – should, on the one hand, improve its strategic planning and increase disbursement of the funds available for the Peace-building Partnership and, on the other hand, present a plan for mobilising financial resources for any emergency external assistance facilities or mechanisms created outside the Instrument for Stability in order to avoid having to draw on the funds allocated for this Instrument.

Furthermore, with this report Parliament is asking the Commission to involve it more than it has done previously in matters relating to the use of financial stability instruments. Our Parliament, which represents the European nations and citizens, must play a more active role in these matters, and the other European institutions must get used to the idea that a parliament must be informed of the spending decisions made by an executive: at stake is the effectiveness not only of individual actions, but of the democratic nature of the European political system as a whole.</p>

Moreover, even when force proves necessary, the current state of our civilisation calls for surgical rather than wholesale methods. Believing as we do in this cultural model, we have to set an example to everyone else and show that it must not be greater economic strength that makes a difference in the resolution of conflicts, but a range of instruments that always put human life first, and which permit the use of violence only in extreme cases, especially to protect the lives and strategic interests of the European public. It is not a question of taking a stand a priori , but of adopting a consistent and rigorous approach in which military capacity is merely a deterrent and will never become a vehicle for radically changing the nature of the European Union or promoting a system of values other than the one upheld.</p>

As EU-ACP preference agreements are incompatible with the agreements signed between the EU and the World Trade Organisation and since positive results have been obtained in the ACP banana-producing countries under previous preference agreements, we should support the adjustment, reorganisation and competitiveness of the banana exporting sector in these countries. In a broad sense, these accompanying measures for the banana sector should have a positive impact, not only for the producers, the first link in the production chain, but also with regard to the criteria for the fight against poverty.

I believe that the European Union should take a step forward in guaranteeing greater protection for European consumers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">By voting in favour of the report on country-of-origin markings on certain products from countries outside the EU, Parliament is responding to the expectations of consumers for improved transparency in products. The European consumer will henceforth enjoy, as do Chinese and American consumers, the right to know the provenance of products. This proposal for a regulation will allow European businesses to promote their know-how, traditional methods of production and the high quality of their work. Finally, it provides fair conditions of competition between European businesses and the trading partners of the European Union which, in their case, already enjoy this kind of legislation. European businesses manufacturing high-quality products of excellence will then benefit from an instrument to protect and promote them in order to support them in the face of tough competition from countries outside the European Union in certain sectors.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Therefore, for the sake of transparency and of protecting consumers, but also of protecting European producers, it is essential for goods imported from third countries to be correctly identified as such, noting their origin.</p>

A break with the current World Trade Organisation guidelines is urgently needed to enable countries to prioritise the development of their own production and markets, by monitoring imported goods, imposing the same minimum quality and technical criteria demanded of companies within the EU, combating dumping, effectively regulating the capital markets, penalising the relocation of companies, taxing financial transactions, and putting a stop to tax havens.</p>

It has been voluntary until now, and will become mandatory from now on within the Union. Let us remember, in this respect, that the Union is not doing anything new in this domain. The United States, for example, brought in a requirement of this kind in 1930. Nowadays, it is, indeed, essential for consumers throughout Europe to be better informed about the origin of the goods that they wish to purchase. Only a system with clear rules is able to tell them about the social and environmental conditions of manufacturing, protect them from health risks and, finally, help them make informed decisions. It is a victory not only for consumers, but also for European exporting companies which are already subject to strict requirements. With this vote, the European Parliament has signed the defeat of a system of unfair competition, and has thereby ensured that those European businesses which have opted for high quality and employment are not unfairly penalised by more lax regulations applying to their competitors throughout the world.</p>

The highest possible level of transparency and maximum rights are needed in order for it to be possible to make objective purchasing decisions. I am in general in favour of a project that aims to inform EU citizens of the origin of the raw materials used, the stages of production, but also the production, social and working conditions prevalent in the country in question. Unfortunately, the Commission’s proposal does nothing of the kind. The mandatory ‘made-in’ regulation contained in the current version says nothing about the actual origin of a product or about the conditions under which it was produced and processed. Even prominent European textile firms, despite voluntary self-regulation, are unable to guarantee that raw materials obtained from companies in third countries and used in their production have not been extracted using child labour. I understand product transparency for consumers to mean something different. This proposal does not go far enough and does not meet the information requirements of interested end users.

This regulation will also help create a level playing field with many trading partners of ours which already impose mandatory origin marking on imported goods. It is in fact essential to guarantee fair conditions of competition with the producers of the EU’s main partners.

I think we must introduce legislation as quickly as possible which will include an unconditional requirement for the same information to be given by third countries which market their goods in the EU. This practice is already followed in many of the large third countries which are our largest trading partners. In many large countries, such as the United States, Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia, consumers are guaranteed protection by a legal requirement for the marking of goods brought into their territory. It is important that the consumers and producers of our main trading partners be subject to the same legislation as our consumers and producers. Then it will be possible to speak of fair rules of play.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Commercial policy can harmonise closely with development policy. Product marking can contribute to a growth in exports from developing countries. European consumers are sensitive to the need for aid to less industrialised countries, and their knowledge of the origin of a particular product can enable them to contribute to the development of poorer countries. Marking makes choosing easier for consumers, who often associate the geographical origin of a particular product with its market value.

European framework programmes that support innovation and research and development can be a valid input in the process of standardisation.

It is in all our interests to see Ukraine as an economically developed and politically stable state, with its closest partners to be found in the West. We understand that it will not be easy to achieve this, for that country must stabilise its financial situation and carry out numerous reforms. However, this must be done and the EU should offer its support to this work. The constructive work on the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement must continue and work on the extended Free Trade Agreement must be given a kick start. Geographically, Ukraine is situated in a very important location, which is also important for gas supply to the EU. That is why it is necessary to support the modernisation of Ukraine’s gas transit system, in order to reduce the risk of interruption to gas supplies to EU countries, as has happened recently. At the same time, we must not turn a blind eye to violations of democracy, which have become more serious since Viktor Yanukovych took office as President. It is our duty to point out these violations and take a strong stand on compliance with Western values in Ukraine, for our Union is founded on those values.</p>

Indeed, the Transnistria problem is of paramount importance to the stability of the Republic of Moldova and the whole region, with the EU having a major role to play in implementing a negotiated, lasting solution. Increasing macro-financial assistance for the Republic of Moldova, encouraging structural reforms and the fight against corruption, boosting the environment for investment, as well as moving as quickly as possible into the operational phase of the dialogue on visa liberalisation for Moldovan citizens: these are the key elements of the support being provided by Europe to a state whose place is in the European Union.</p>

The Baltic Sea is one of the seas worst damaged by economic activity and one of the most polluted seas in the world. As the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrated, sensitive marine ecosystems can be damaged in an instant. Therefore I particularly support the call on Member States, anchored in the report, to take more action to plan a wide-ranging strategy to protect the marine environment.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Meissner report is a balanced text that incorporates a series of important factors and requests. Maritime activities are one of the most important sources of European income. To quote just a few figures, they generate 40% of EU GDP and, at the same time, account for 40% of trade in goods within Europe and 95% of exports outside Europe. The report focuses on a few key points: the establishment of appropriate maritime governance structures at national and regional levels; coordinated and cross-border maritime spatial planning; maritime surveillance to protect the Member States and the EU; the protection of the marine environment; the creation of a strategy for sustainable coastal and island tourism; and the promotion of the European shipbuilding industry, which is already a flagship sector, and of maritime transport, in order to meet the ambitious objective of ‘green shipping’. For the reasons stated above, I felt compelled to vote in favour. We absolutely must ensure that the communication between and integration of the various sectors that come under maritime policy are a success for a whole host of reasons linked to efficiency, competitiveness, and respect for and protection of the marine environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EP agrees with the Commission that our ‘strong maritime tradition’ is one of the strengths of Europe. It calls therefore on the European Commission and the Member States to further develop the potential offered by the different maritime sectors by drawing up an ambitious ‘blue growth’ strategy. It considers that integrated maritime policy (IMP) should contribute to achieving a competitive, social and sustainable Union. It takes the view in this regard that the development of IMP must harmoniously incorporate efforts to attain economic development, a high level of employment – particularly by making the sector more attractive for young people through training actions and the launch of a ‘Maritime Erasmus’ – and environmental protection. It states, therefore, that the IMP should be interconnected with the objectives and initiatives of the EU 2020 Strategy. Moreover, the EP asks the Commission, therefore, to come up with an overarching, cross-sectoral strategy for sustainable growth in coastal regions and maritime sectors by 2013, based on a broad investigation of potentials and policy options and on broad stakeholder consultation.</p>

      <p sl="it">While on the one hand there is clearly a need to integrate maritime policy within the European Union, given that its associated activities produce 40% of EU GDP, on the other it is right to regulate such activities taking non-EU competitors into account. Too often, the rules on fishing, tourism, transport and environmental protection in the sector have been developed separately and with no regard for the risks associated with unfair competition from third countries. For example, extending overly strict emissions targets to all the coastal regions in Europe may create distortions of competition.</p>
      <p sl="it">Other texts on the issues faced have been debated and approved by Parliament and will doubtless need to be coordinated in an integrated manner.

Often these separate activities are carried out in ways which conflict and which have a detrimental effect on maritime policy as a whole. It is obvious that an integrated maritime policy will contribute to further sustainable economic development of the European Union. This will make possible, among other things, ensuring greater cohesion between different policy areas, creation of better regulation and cross-sectoral instruments and use of maritime potential and the potential of the maritime sector in an economical and ecological fashion.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report on integrated maritime policy concerns an important sector of the European economy. Maritime activities in fact represent an important source of income for the EU, both in terms of GDP and in terms of trade in goods within and outside Europe. I believe that certain issues should be emphasised. Firstly, the report states that future strategies in this sector will be tailored to the specificities of sea basins, but I believe it is very important to take account of specific regional circumstances, too. The new maritime policy will also be focused on the development of safe ships and will offer great opportunities for the future of European shipbuilding. Our seas should continue to be a driving force behind growth, hence why I believe it is essential for the development of integrated maritime policy to ensure greater coherence between the rules governing the various maritime sectors and, at the same time, to safeguard the marine environment.</p>

That recovery must not be undermined.

From now on it is up to the Commission to take account of this policy requirement of Parliament in future negotiations. Within these negotiations, Parliament sought for particular attention to be paid to the outermost regions, due to competition from the Latin American continent in certain products, in particular bananas.

      <p sl="pt">The Treaty of Lisbon defines the EU’s trade policy as an integral part of the Union’s general external action. In recent times there has been a decline in trade between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean region (LAC) by virtue of the growing participation of Asian countries in LAC external trade, despite the fact that the EU remains Latin America’s second-largest trading partner. While the association agreements between the European Union and Mexico and Chile have caused a substantial increase in the trade volume, trade between Mexico and Europe is still modest when compared with Mexico’s trade with the United States. I therefore highlight the need for both parties to develop a broader range of trade-related economic activities. The bulk (over 85%) of LAC imports from the EU today are industrial products. In turn, more than 40% of exports from the region to the EU are basic products. It is therefore necessary to mobilise resources and technical assistance to identify and finance programmes that provide production opportunities at local and regional levels, and sustainable access to global markets for excluded communities and for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Parliament asks what should be done. We have said many times that we do not accept human rights violations. We have been dictating to African countries, but nothing has happened.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that when we give humanitarian aid to African countries in the future we must make it conditional on the observance of human rights. We have not been tough enough in some cases and in other cases we have only dictated what to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Maybe we should have closer cooperation with all African countries and with the African Union and try and get them to understand the situation so that the European Union does not continue to give money if human rights violations continue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the first indent of our resolution says it all: ‘Having regard to its numerous previous resolutions on Zimbabwe, most recently that of 8 July this year’. We were speaking then about human rights violations in the diamond fields of Zimbabwe, and we are speaking now about eviction around Harare.</p>
      <p sl="en">People are being evicted who were already evicted in 2005 in Operation Murambatsvina, which incidentally means ‘clean out the trash’. The same people who were cleaned out as trash last time are being evicted now. Last time it was Mugabe’s Government fighting its fight against the MDC. This time it is the Unity Government of Zanu and MDC. I must say that I am deeply disappointed that, within this Unity Government, this sort of human rights violation still continues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think this will be our last resolution on Zimbabwe. I will be here next time and I will make the point again.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this urgent humanitarian resolution must be viewed against a backdrop of political disagreement between Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai, and this disagreement is the focus of the request for the European Union not to accept the new ambassadors unilaterally appointed by Mr Mugabe. However, this urgent humanitarian resolution can be linked to the elections and to the political gains that may be had in driving populations out of the townships in which they are staying.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us cast our minds back to June 2005 and Operation Murambatsvina, mentioned just now: a township was exposed to the forceful and purely politically motivated intervention of Robert Mugabe’s bulldozers, and 700 000 people lost their homes. The same thing is happening today: 20 000 of the poorest people in Zimbabwe, housed in the Hatcliffe Extension townships, not very far from Harare, are being threatened with eviction just because they cannot afford the exorbitant rents they are being charged; it is a rather extensive operation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us also remember that the humanitarian and economic situation is becoming ever worse for millions of Zimbabweans, that the AIDS prevalence rate in Zimbabwe is the fourth highest in the world, and that children are dying there all the time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are so many reasons right now for this urgent resolution and for a strong appeal to the entire international community in order to ensure that this reconciliation – I will not say this pseudo-reconciliation within Zimbabwe’s coalition government, but this reconciliation, anyway – is not destroyed today amid these aggressive preparations on the eve of the elections.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I tend to think that the human rights situation in Zimbabwe is unfortunately not what we would normally call an emergency in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Human rights are in fact repeatedly violated in that country, as the numerous resolutions voted on in this Chamber show. In the most recent one, as has been said, we denounced the arrest, on 22 July, of Mr Farai Muguwu, the founder and director of the Centre for Research and Development, whose crime was to report the atrocities committed in the diamond fields by, among others, the military authorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we are addressing the issue of forced evictions. This issue is not new. Indeed, as Mrs De Keyser said, an operation of this kind was launched by the Zimbabwean authorities in 2005. It was called Operation ‘Murambatsvina’, which means to restore order. It was quite some programme, I am sure you would agree, and it clearly shows what the Zimbabwean authorities mean by the word order. Seven hundred thousand people were affected at that time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The international community unanimously denounced the methods used. What is the situation like today? The majority of the people affected are still living in tents. Worse still, in August, armed police officers – I did indeed say police officers – came and set fire to the shelters of some 250 displaced persons who had set up home on the outskirts of Harare. Twenty thousand people – this point has also been made – are today threatened with the same fate because they have not paid their residence tax, which they really cannot afford.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These men, women and children are in fact some of the country’s poorest people. Are we going to let this go on without saying anything? Are we going to remind the Zimbabwean authorities once again of their international commitments, as Baroness Ashton did during the recent EU-Zimbabwe summit in July?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are well aware that there is friction between President Mugabe and the Prime Minister following the global political agreement signed on 15 September 2008 and the appointment, on 13 February, of the government of national unity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Recently, President Mugabe threatened to dissolve the government almost there and then because it had dared to remind him of his constitutional obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time to react in Zimbabwe and in many other countries throughout the world in order to stop the dialogue with dictators who hold on to power through the use of force and fraud, and whose sole aim is to pillage their country’s resources for personal gain.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The evictions in Zimbabwe represent an outrageous disregard for internationally recognised human rights. The forced evictions, without provision of compensation or alternative accommodation, are completely contrary to international law. The Government of Zimbabwe is committing egregious violations of the civil, political, economic and social rights guaranteed by the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Continuation of the evictions is exposing increasing numbers of new people to indignity and homelessness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We call on the Government of Zimbabwe to cease these practices and to stop the forced evictions.

      <p sl="pl">We need only make a list of the newspaper headlines about Zimbabwe from the last five years to have a picture of what conditions are like in a country which has been ruled for three decades by President Robert Mugabe. Headlines such as: ‘Zimbabwe – police beat up opposition’ or ‘Mugabe has destroyed Africa’ are among the mildest expressions, and the authorities of the African regime find themselves under the constant pressure of international public opinion. Extreme poverty and lack of access to basic medical services, gigantic unemployment levels which reach 90% and the short average life span, which is today only 44 years, are the true face of Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In these circumstances it is difficult to understand why the government considers it a priority to evict 20 000 citizens from the suburbs of the capital Harare, forcing them to leave behind their humble belongings. I join the appeal of international organisations such as Amnesty International for the Government of Zimbabwe to cease the repression of its own citizens and concentrate on giving them real help in schools, hospitals and the labour market. Zimbabwe, which is a poor country, cannot afford to waste time and money by investing in other areas.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, at the EU-Africa Summit in Libya next November there should be talks on how Mugabe and his close supporters remain a continuing stumbling block in the process of political and economic reconstruction and reconciliation in Zimbabwe. They are plundering its economic resources for their own benefit and they are not granting their citizens fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Around 20 000 people living in the outskirts of Harare have been threatened with forced eviction. The Government is demanding a renewal lease fee of up to USD 140, but in a country where per capita income is less than USD 100 this is effectively impossible and this demand is a de facto licence for abuse. In 2005, 70 000 people were evicted and these people still live in dire circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="de">In general, the humanitarian, political and economic situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate and millions of people continue to be at risk of starvation. The country has the world’s fourth-highest rate of HIV and high child mortality. People do not have many chances to grow up in health and prosperity, and if they do they lack fundamental freedoms such as freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="de">Zimbabwe ranks 123rd in terms of freedom of the press. The return of independent dailies is a step forward for public access to information, but the situation is still very fragile. I want to draw specific attention to the situation of LGBTI people in Zimbabwe.

That is because every day this gang remains in power is a reflection of our powerlessness and of the fact that the international community does not have the muscle to keep this oppressor in check.</p>

I think that our response or reaction to this situation is very clear. The Government of Zimbabwe must take action in keeping with its international obligations.

      <p sl="ro">As has already been stated in this House, Zimbabwe is one of the countries where hunger is reaching catastrophic proportions, according to the report from the International Food Policy Research Institute published last week. The rate of undernutrition among the population, the prevalence of underweight children and the infant mortality rate are the three indicators which dramatically highlight the chronic situation in terms of food shortages, affecting millions of people.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, hundreds of thousands of the poorest people in Zimbabwe have been evicted from their homes as part of a barbaric eviction operation whose brutal name is translated as ‘Drive Out Rubbish’. These people have not only lost their homes, but also their jobs, thereby increasing the unemployment rate to 90% of the country’s population. This is happening while the dictator Mugabe declared that the people were extremely happy. This was the view cynically expressed by the man who will remain in history the creator of the cruellest, long-standing dictatorship in the world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that it is absolutely imperative for us to request the regime in Zimbabwe to halt the forced evictions as a matter of urgency, put an end to the serious human rights violations and persecution of activists from civil society, and to refrain from any acts of violence, which are increasing at an alarming rate.</p>

I believe it may be naive to expect that we may achieve a change through persuasion and criticism. Our measures should be more vigorous; people like Mugabe only listen to financial consequences or brute force. I think we have some financial measures at our disposal.

The corrupt nature of the government and the general mess in both the economy and in society are generally leading to a situation where the basics for existence are just not there.

      <p sl="en">I had hoped that there would have been a chance of reconciliation and peace and a transition towards true democracy a few years ago when Morgan Tsvangirai became Prime Minister in a power-sharing brokered deal, but it would appear that Mugabe has been able to reassert his absolute grip on power and revert to the kind of behaviour for which he is only too well known – namely violence, eviction and repression. Ultimately it is the poor Zimbabweans who suffer in that now almost broken economy. If it were not for the lifeline extended to Zimbabwe as a result of governments like the People’s Republic of China giving them handouts, and money coming from Libya and others, it would not survive.</p>

      <p sl="en">I would like to remind this ruling party that the EU is the single largest donor institution to Cambodia and that this aid is conditional on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2006 Sam Rainsy received the Prize for Freedom from Liberal International. He received this prize for the defence of freedoms we share across this Parliament.

      <p sl="en">The guarantee of free and fair political expression without intimidation or harassment is also a necessity. More specifically, we should state that we are alarmed at the prosecution and sentencing to a total of 12 years in prison of the opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, on account of a gesture which it considers to be of a symbolic and clearly political nature. It is particularly alarming that, if upheld, this verdict would bar Sam Rainsy from standing in the 2013 parliamentary elections and have consequences far beyond Rainsy’s case, as it is bound to affect the opposition as such.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this is an urgent resolution that is dominated by Sam Rainsy, an occasionally controversial figure, but that must not make us forget the true democratic issue hiding behind this case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So, Sam Rainsy, as has been said, is a liberal figure and opponent of the leader, Hun Sen. Mr Rainsy had already been sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, only to be granted a pardon in 2006. Indeed, he accused Hun Sen of being behind the 1997 grenade attack.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, he has been convicted of the crime – a symbolic one, as has been said – of moving the markings of the disputed border between Vietnam and Cambodia and of distributing so-called fake maps. Twelve years in absentia is a lot, but it is in fact clear what this is all about. The sole aim is to prevent him from standing in the next elections, in 2013, and he is the leader of the country’s second political opposition party.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, the political climate in Cambodia is tense, elections are approaching and vote-winning tactics are being employed, but there is also a drift towards authoritarianism, and I would like to mention, aside from the Rainsy case, that of NGO representatives who have been prosecuted: the politician Mu Sochua, found guilty of defaming the Prime Minister, the journalist Hang Chakra, imprisoned for having denounced the corruption within the Deputy Prime Minister Sok An’s entourage, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore just like to point out, as others have done, that we are donors, that we have a cooperation agreement that stipulates that fundamental freedoms must be respected. I also call for an emergency humanitarian plan for the people, the populations affected by the construction and textile crises. That is also important.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Sam Rainsy’s treatment is just the tip of the iceberg with respect to the authoritarian control which the ruling party in Cambodia exercises to wield political power over a court in order to silence criticism of the government. This government, of course, has as its main objective the suppression of civil society and the promotion of a one-party system. This is also reflected in Rainsy’s sentence, an attempt to prevent him from standing in the elections in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As has already been mentioned here, the EU is the single largest donor institution to Cambodia, and for that reason it is important that in this resolution we do not just content ourselves with condemning the numerous breaches of human rights in the country, the lack of any proper viable judicial system, and the politicisation of the armed forces. We must in no uncertain terms also remind them of the cooperation agreement that exists between the EU and Cambodia and of its Article 1, which calls for a respect for human rights. There must be consequences if civil freedoms continue to be flouted, and the EU must make a clear improvement to the human rights situation a condition of continued aid.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The 12-year prison sentence handed down to Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy is actually a serious human rights violation and a blatant indication of the authoritarianism which dominates political life in Cambodia. Following his expulsion from the National Assembly and the withdrawal of his parliamentary immunity three times so far, along with numerous assassination attempts and the murder of dozens of his supporters, Sam Rainsy has now been convicted in absentia for his protests with strong political overtones.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Basically, the ultimate aim of the sentence handed down in September is to prevent the leader of the opposition from being a candidate in the elections due to be held in more than two years’ time, which compromises Cambodia’s chances of achieving democracy once and for all. In addition to the requests submitted via this resolution to the Cambodian Government, asking for an end to political persecutions, I would also like to add a request to the European Union’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the authorities for them to resume the political and institutional reforms required to establish genuine democracy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Cambodia is a very beautiful country with a great history, but there are dark sides to both the country and its history. The latest problems include people disappearing, people being imprisoned without trial, high levels of corruption, illegal land-grabbing and illegal logging. The thing which should most concern us as Members of the European Parliament is that the people who criticise and denounce these practices are dragged off the street, face sham trials and are then put in prison.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sam Rainsy, the opposition leader in Cambodia, has been subjected to serious persecution. He has already been elected, but was thrown out of the parliament in 1995. However, he managed to return. There were a number of attacks on him during election rallies, one of which left 80 people dead. I have had the privilege of visiting him in Cambodia. I found him to be a very peaceful person and a committed supporter of democracy and human rights. Now he has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for a symbolic act on the basis of flimsy arguments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party also locks up a large proportion of the people of the country who are represented by this person. Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party and prevents him from taking part in the next elections is blocking the democratic process and violating civil and human rights. I believe that we should not accept this and I call on the Commission to demand that, in particular, the terms of article 1 of the cooperation agreement with Cambodia are fulfilled. This refers to respect for human rights in Cambodia being a precondition for the provision of aid by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I have twice had the opportunity to visit Cambodia. The first time was two years ago, with the observation delegation of the European Parliament during the parliamentary elections, and the second time was six months ago. I must say that Cambodia is a country which has developed very rapidly in recent years – I am talking about economic development – as, indeed, have other countries in that part of the world. Unfortunately, the rapid economic development in Cambodia has not been accompanied by a process of democratisation. For there is no true democracy without strong media which keep checks on the ruling party, without a strong opposition or without a strong non-governmental organisation sector.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The sentence imposed on Sam Rainsy, which is by no means the first, is another blow to the opposition. If this sentence is upheld, Sam Rainsy will not be able to stand in the next parliamentary elections, although he enjoys fairly high popularity in his country. The sentence is puzzling in that over 30 years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, very many of the leaders of the regime in Cambodia still have not been tried. Questioning the Vietnamese-Cambodian border certainly does not help stabilisation in the region, nevertheless this matter should be resolved by political means and not by a judicial sentence.</p>

      <p sl="ro">It is deplorable that Cambodian courts are still resorting to arrest as a means of intimidating political opponents and dissidents. The most common targets for this action are journalists, human rights activists and other critics speaking out in favour of freedom of speech.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The charges brought against Sam Rainsy are obviously more of a political than criminal nature. He has been sentenced to 12 years in prison following a symbolic gesture of protest which he made against the way in which the border with Vietnam has been marked. However, the real reason for his conviction seems to be to remove the opposition from the parliamentary election contest to be held in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the Cambodian Government to abide by its commitments towards consolidating the state of democracy. Sam Rainsy, as the main opposition leader, must be allowed to resume his duties in the Cambodian Parliament as soon as possible. This would help stop the move towards the single-party system, which poses a threat to the respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the decision of the Cambodian court to sentence opposition leader Sam Rainsy to 10 years in prison in charges relating to the spread of disinformation and falsification of official documents, and other cases like it have led to justified concern in the West regarding the impartiality and independence of the country’s legal system.</p>
      <p sl="fi">There has been a systematic attempt there superficially to interpret the clauses in the law on the spread of false information and slander and libel in such a way that it tends to hamper the work of the opposition and NGOs. The clauses in question have actually been used to restrict freedom of opinion and expression.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Although I acknowledge the significant development that Cambodia has gone through since the Pol Pot regime, I would regard it as vexing if the Cambodian Government were to decide to leave the process of building a democratic system half-finished, which, unfortunately, has been the case in a large number of countries. Cambodia has signed up to several international agreements, including its cooperation agreement with the European Union, to safeguard the fundamental rights of its people and the implementation of democratic principles within its territory. The European Union must in no uncertain terms call on the Cambodian Government to respect its commitments.</p>

      <p sl="ro">As has already been mentioned, Sam Rainsy has been given two prison sentences. The 10-year sentence he has now received for allegedly spreading disinformation and falsifying public documents has been added to the earlier one for two years. As my fellow Members have also stated, this is an obvious attempt to block his participation in the future elections. There is an issue with the procedure followed in this whole story, which is that Sam Rainsy was convicted in absentia as part of proceedings which were held behind closed doors and which, according to reports, were highlighted by numerous irregularities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is actually not an isolated case. Many more critics of the Cambodian Government have endured similar treatment involving criminal prosecutions. As has already been mentioned, I believe that, based on the Cooperation Agreement signed with the European Union, the Cambodian authorities have to abide by their clear commitments linked to human rights.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In Cambodia, as in many other countries, the struggle for political power is descending into a real fight; a life-and-death struggle, as the saying goes. In such situations, power structures destroy, persecute and imprison their political opposition.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This seems to be the case of Sam Rainsy whom the current leaders naturally intend to dispose of because he represents competition, and embodies for them the risk of future political change. As in other cases, we could certainly intervene and ask the Cambodian Government to stop abusing its political opponent and allow him room to join the others on equal terms in order to be able to compete in the political struggle.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think that as a result of our improved relations with Cambodia, we might be more successful in this matter than in the case of Harare. Therefore, I believe it would be worth our while putting the Cambodian Government under political pressure to make it reconsider the manner in which it is proceeding and its treatment of political opponents, and generate conditions for free and correct political competition.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, firstly I want to thank the Members who participated in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I would like to thank those MEPs who have submitted resolutions on Cambodia for this urgency debate. The situation there is indeed a matter of concern.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We have had frank exchanges with our Cambodian interlocutors, most recently at the Joint Committee in Brussels on 8 October, about the state of the country’s democratic institutions and, in particular, the treatment of the opposition in Parliament. The fact that the opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, has had to seek refuge in France is symptomatic of a deteriorating trend.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The same can be said of the judiciary’s involvement in politics and the prosecution of members of the opposition, including those who should be able to benefit from parliamentary immunity. There is a danger that the National Assembly will no longer be able to function as a forum for the free exchange of views. The media, too, are under pressure.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There are some bright spots. Cambodia has accepted all the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Council in the Universal Periodic Review. We also note that a new penal code and an anti-corruption law have been enacted. Clearly we will need to follow how these are implemented in practice. We shall continue to remind Cambodia of the recommendations put forward by our Election Observation Missions in the past. Establishment of an effective Human Rights Committee is an important objective. We welcome the Government’s intention to proceed with this and its initiative in setting up a joint forum with civil society organisations.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Cambodia remains a very poor country. There is a lot that can be done to keep up the momentum of recent economic growth without, at the same time, increasing disparities in society. This should include reform of the rules on land ownership and an end to unsustainable practices in land and forest management, including the exploitation of natural resources.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Sanctioning the government or reducing the level of our contacts would do nothing for the poorest and most vulnerable and would only embolden those who pay lip service to democracy. Therefore, I cannot agree that suspending our bilateral agreement would be helpful.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There is no substitute for patient dialogue. If we are not seen as a major player in the country’s development, we shall lose an opportunity to influence events. Yet there is much we can do in Cambodia at all levels, from the Prime Minister’s office to civil society. We shall continue to encourage positive initiatives that Cambodia is taking in favour of human rights, development and gender equality, while continuing to make the case for a truly pluralistic parliamentary democracy, a freer press and a more independent judiciary.</p>

We are faced with the problem of blatant human rights violations by the Authoritarian Government that is chewing away at the fabric of democracy. As Cambodia's largest donor the EU needs to take swift action in protecting the citizens of Cambodia and reassure them that the democratic process will not faultier. I would like to take this opportunity to address the Government of Cambodia and request their compliance with the U.N. Special Rapporteur's report in a swift and timely manner. The case of Sam Rainsy brings to light the injustices occurring in Cambodia, where Mr. Rainsy, as the leader of the opposition party and Parliament member, has been confronted with what can only be viewed as a deliberate effort to curtail any opposition to the established Authoritarian Government. The practises of charging and detaining any persons viewed as a threat to the Government must end. Furthermore, the citizens still have no guarantee of independence and impartiality from the judiciary. These issues must be confronted and addressed immediately by this Parliament to assure the citizens of Cambodia that this Parliament continues to support and defend their right to Democracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to say that this resolution on the situation in the North Caucasus, and in particular on the case of Oleg Orlov, is one of the most deserving resolutions this House has adopted for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The tragedy reigning in the North Caucasus has only deepened in recent years with pervasive human rights violations still affecting the daily lives of the communities in Chechnya, in Ossetia, Dagestan, North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria.</p>
      <p sl="en">The violence is far from over. Only last Tuesday, at least six people were killed in an attack on Chechnya’s Parliament building in Grozny. At least 17 people were injured, most of them civilians. On 9 September, 17 people were killed and many others wounded in a bombing in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The tragedies of the past are not accounted for either. The families of victims in Beslan still do not know what exactly happened to their children and loved ones, how they died or where their bodies are.</p>
      <p sl="en">Not only has the vicious circle of violence and impunity left these communities distraught and paralysed, the failure to tackle the situation has led the violence to spread beyond the borders of the North Caucasian republics.</p>
      <p sl="en">While Muscovites have felt the trauma of terrorism, Chechen refugees in Europe fear persecution, even murder. People disappear even in the capital city, Moscow, or in St Petersburg, as has happened during the past year.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there comes a point when this must stop. The winner of the 2009 Sakharov Prize, Mr Orlov, being placed under criminal charges could be the point at which Europe finally says enough is enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should seek now to cooperate with the Council of Europe on the excellent report produced by Dick Marty on legal remedies for human rights violations in the North Caucasus.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today President Buzek announced the winner of this year’s Sakharov Prize. This prize embodies freedom of thought, an essential European freedom and right we stand for on behalf of our citizens and across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to the Nobel Peace Prize award, President Buzek called firmly on China to release Liu Xiao Bo and said: ‘Freedom is not a threat, but the threats to freedom can be many’. This also goes for the people who defend human rights in the Northern Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year’s Sakharov Prize awardees Oleg Orlov, Sergei Kovalev and Lyudmila Alexeyeva, of Memorial, have not been able to pick up their award personally as their freedom is threatened. The EU invests tremendously in EU-Russia relations, and we are joined through the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia has thus committed itself to protecting and promoting human rights and the rule of law, but what a long way we are from that situation. Intimidation of journalists and civil society activists prevails, disappearances of human rights defenders happen systematically and there is no freedom of expression, including on the Internet. The absence of the rule of law has led to 20 000 cases pending at the European Court of Human Rights from the Russian Federation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia has the right to fight terrorism in the Northern Caucasus, but if the rule of law is not upheld this has a counter-productive effect on stability. There really is no excuse for Russia not to comply with its own commitment to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We look forward and will see to it that the representatives of Memorial have the freedom to come to this Parliament, thereby symbolising the freedoms and rights that all citizens in the Northern Caucasus enjoy.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I am very concerned about the growing climate of fear that surrounds human rights defenders in Russia. We owe our support to Oleg Orlov, to whom we awarded the Saharov Prize last year. His sole crime is to have spoken about human rights in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Fundamental rights are also being breached within the EU, but what has happened in Russia is something else entirely. We must struggle against all kinds of terrorism and radical extremism using all the legal means available to us, but also availing ourselves of the remedies offered by civil society. There is no longer any need for oppression in the North Caucasus: there needs to be dialogue instead. There must be no more crime, but more respect for the law and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Justice is always carried out objectively and subjectively. In the North Caucasus this means that criminals should be convicted and the needs of the victims of crime taken into account. Adopting this statement is a clear and consistent show of support for Orlov, as it is too for all the others who struggle in the name of human rights. We must bear this case in mind when we discuss new relations between the EU and Russia. Russia must respect human rights to be able to play a genuine role in Europe and accept the European ethos: Europe is on the side of people, not against them.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In Communist times, when the Solidarity movement in Poland was fighting for human rights and democracy, a slogan was widely used which said: ‘there is no freedom without Solidarity’. Today, in the context of what is happening in the North Caucasus, although not only there, but also in many other parts of Russia, it can be said that there is no stabilisation without the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is very important to talk about these two phenomena together. We cannot talk about economic and political relations with Russia while ignoring human rights there. It is, in fact, a system of interconnected vessels, they are not two separate subjects. Elementary honesty demands that we not only talk about improving relations with Russia – with that great country – but also that we require of Moscow that it respect human rights, including in the case of someone who has been awarded the Sakharov Prize. This is a singular slap in the face for the European Parliament and the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to take advantage of this speech to ask for us together to think about what purpose the Sakharov Prize serves.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to begin by thanking my colleagues, and Mrs Hautala in particular, for having responded to my request concerning the situation of Mr Orlov. Indeed, Mr Orlov is one of the three people in charge of Memorial, the association to which we awarded the Sakharov Prize last year.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By handing over this prize, we rewarded the commitment of those who still dare to denounce the situation in Chechnya. It was symbolic because it came a few months after the murder of Natalia Estemirova, a murder that Mr Orlov strongly condemned. We knew that the Chechen President was suing Mr Orlov for his hatred, that he had pressed charges against him. In January 2010 Mr Orlov and Memorial were found guilty, and we did not say a thing. On 6 July Mr Orlov was charged once again, and he is now facing a three-year prison term.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we award the Sakharov Prize, we aim to raise the profile of the work of men and women who fight for democracy and human rights and, in awarding them the prize, we place them under our protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, what have we done for Mr Orlov and for all those who defend human rights in Russia and in Chechnya? In what way have we developed the EU’s dialogue to ensure that human rights are at last respected in the North Caucasus? Can we tolerate, without saying anything, the fact that no legal action has been taken more than a year after Mrs Estemirova’s murder? Can we tolerate human rights defenders being kidnapped, mistreated and disappearing without any reaction by the courts?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I almost feel like saying, what purpose do we serve if, part-session after part-session, we denounce a number of human rights violations without it stopping the Commission from pursuing its supposedly constructive dialogues and from telling us that progress is being made, but just not in the fields of human rights and justice? When will we stop renouncing these supposedly fundamental values for the benefit of the economic and political interests of certain Member States? We might be more credible, ladies and gentlemen, if our sittings were not pushed back to last thing on Thursday afternoon, and if there were a few more of us here to follow these debates.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the North Caucasus was a victim of tsarist colonial policy and of attempts at genocide by the Stalinist regime. However, unfortunately it was also involved in two brutal wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union which went as far genocide against smaller ethnic groups, such as the Chechens. Today it is still a region where small, evil satellite regimes, like that of Mr Kadyrov, commit horrific violations of human rights. We condemn all forms of terrorism on all sides, but this regime has nothing to do with democracy and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to resolve this situation, we need a three-pronged approach, involving close cooperation between the Council of Europe, together with the European Court of Human Rights, the European Parliament as the driving force behind the European Union and the human rights organisations in the region, which are attempting to protect it from the might of Russia. The human rights organisation Memorial plays a central role in this respect. Therefore, we are calling not only for Mr Oleg Orlov to be left in peace immediately, but also for him to be given support for his commendable work on behalf of human rights. We owe that to him and his fellow combatants, to the people of the North Caucasus and also to our murdered friend and comrade Natalia Estemirova, whom many of us knew personally and whose murder must finally be resolved. We are under an obligation to her to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are introduced into the North Caucasus.</p>

The violations of human rights are destabilising the situation in the North Caucasus, are prolonging the conflict, are reducing the chances for its resolution and are, in fact, creating support for underground terrorist activity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Human rights organisations such as Memorial should be supported because they are essential for the creation of a stable and free society, as also they are needed for the establishment of a stability which is real and lasting. These organisations should be supported, therefore, and it is also necessary to condemn the reprehensible deeds which are being perpetrated in the North Caucasus, to speak out for the growing number of people who have disappeared and to remember the suffering of those who have been displaced.</p>

I am very familiar with the situation in the Caucasus, as I have been there more than once. At the same time, I should like to remark that the title of ‘human rights defender’ does not give Mr Orlov the right to accuse the President of the Republic of Chechnya of murder. If Mr Orlov believes that the Sakharov prize is a mandate for injudicious assertions, he is mistaken. The European Parliament does not have to act as Orlov’s lawyer. Let Orlov prove his case in court. If not in a Russian court, then in the European Court. We do not have the right to take sides in this dispute. We must give the courts the opportunity to do their work. However, I should like to give Orlov some advice – think before you speak. Defamation is an offence. Thank you.</p>

As you know, Oleg Orlov, together with other members of the organisation Memorial, was awarded the prize last year for his uncompromising and courageous fight for the truth about Russian crimes committed in the Chechen Republic.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are talking, today, about the continued persecution to which Oleg Orlov is being subjected because he is courageously demanding explanations for all the circumstances of the death of Natalia Estemirova, who was the head of Memorial in Chechnya. It should be remembered that the steps taken on the part of ‘President’ Ramzan Kadyrov against Mr Orlov would not have been possible without the support of the Kremlin. Therefore, I appeal to all the authorities of the European Union, including the Commission and the Council, to put pressure on President Medvedev to curb this kind of persecution in Chechnya.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Acts of violence or terrorism are almost an everyday occurrence in the republics in the North Caucasus. The attack carried out last week in the Chechen Parliament highlights that Islamist insurgency is jeopardising the entire region’s stability. Fifteen years after the outbreak of the wars in Chechnya, there are still 80 000 displaced persons in the region. The situation for human rights activists is also alarming, with reports of numerous random abductions and convictions. The case of Oleg Orlov is one of a series of trials initiated without any sound legal basis. He could face three years in prison after he accused the president of Chechnya of involvement in the murder of Natalia Estemirova in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to point out that the investigations launched after this woman’s death have not made any progress so far. For these reasons, I believe that the Federal authorities need to take additional measures to ensure that investigations are conducted properly, including when members of the organisation Memorial are involved.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the best known and most violent conflict in the North Caucasus region was that which began with the First Chechen War. It still continues, although it has spread, in particular to Dagestan and Ingushetia. Without adopting a position on to what extent it is about a war of liberation, a war against terrorism or something else, we cannot deny the fact that there are almost 100 000 internal refugees in the region and a very poor situation with respect to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The human rights activists to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize last year are a force to be reckoned with in Memorial, which has a significant role in the North Caucasus. When he collected the prize last December, Oleg Orlov answered a question on the dangers of his work, saying that the biggest problem was that the threat came from representatives of the state. Few would doubt these words of his.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Anna Politkovskaya was especially known as someone who spoke up for the human rights of Chechens. The Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned in London, had criticised Russian actions in Chechnya. Natalya Estemirova, who was murdered last year, revealed the fact that the security services had been involved in acts of violence and executions, in Chechnya too. The list of similar unsolved murders could go on. That is why it is vital that the European Union should continue to raise these issues.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I would like to begin by correcting something which was said by a fellow Member. We were informed that representatives of Memorial were not able to come to Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize last year. In fact, they were here. It is the ‘Ladies in White’ who cannot collect the prize, because they are not being allowed to leave Havana.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report prepared in June 2010 by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe publishes information about further cases of human rights violations in the North Caucasus. The Russian authorities maintain they are making efforts at stabilisation, but the impunity associated with human rights violations and the absence of the rule of law continue to be the main obstacles to real and lasting stability in the region. Civilians are still living under the threat of violence. Torture and ill-treatment are commonplace, as are forced disappearances, arbitrary murders and arbitrary arrests. Investigations into human rights violations are ineffective and defective. Their only result is often the failure to punish the perpetrators, which increases the mistrust of government institutions and the entire justice system.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is our duty to take all possible steps, not only to enable permanent monitoring of the situation in the North Caucasus, but also to take action intended to guarantee the rule of law and support for civil and democratic initiatives and to bring an end to the lawlessness in the region.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I believe that the main problem in the North Caucasus is disregard for the most important thing of all, namely respect for individual human rights Such human rights violations destabilise the situation in the region, prolong and deepen conflict, decrease the chances for its resolution, and help generate the basis for reactionary terrorist groups.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Ramzan Kadyrov, who has assumed power in Chechnya, does not contribute to stability. He has become the absolute ruler of this republic, defying the law or misinterpreting it so that he may act in contradiction of fundamental human rights. Moreover, abuses directed against certain individuals may neither be publicised nor discussed. Oleg Orlov, a member of the Memorial group, is a sorry example of the persecution of those who defend human rights. The situation seems to be tragically without a solution, and that is why it is the moral obligation of the European Parliament to painstakingly monitor events in the region, and regularly insist on respect for rights which the citizens and human rights organisations in the Russian Federation still cannot enjoy on a day-to-day basis despite official rhetoric.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I too feel obliged to speak out in solidarity with Oleg Orlov and the Human Rights Centre Memorial, which he heads. They were awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought last year by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The conviction for slandering the Chechen President and the trial initiated against Oleg Orlov, who could now face years in prison, mark the horrible culmination of a depressing series of acts of persecution against human rights activists, including the most terrible one involving the abduction and murder of Natalia Estemirova, Memorial’s coordinator in Chechnya. I feel obliged to protest against these brutal, repeated violations against human rights, justified by the need to combat terrorism, against the impunity of those guilty of serious crimes and abuses, as well as against the Russian authorities tolerating this situation, which is affecting the credibility of their commitment to democracy.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like to think here about how it is possible that we are still only discussing the human rights of a relatively small group of people and are completely missing the main issue. The bottom line in the North Caucasus is the strong external interference of Wahhabis who are trained, who are armed and who are moving in with clear objectives.</p>
      <p sl="cs">If you do not know where the Wahhabis come from and who finances them – well, it is the same sources that are being talked about with regard to other terrorist organisations. Unfortunately, in this resolution, the main issue – that is, why there are flagrant violations of human rights in various parts of the North Caucasus – is completely missing. Of course, it is necessary to respect human rights, but it is necessary to create the conditions for complying with them. If terrorist organisations are being financed from abroad – and this is certainly the case – then it is difficult for us to provide these conditions. Unfortunately, the resolution does not take account of that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I give my full backing to this resolution, which is supported by my political group and calls for action in support of Sakharov awardee Oleg Orlov and what he stands for – namely opposition to the human rights violations that go on in the Northern Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say in this respect that I do not see myself and my Group reflected in the words of Mr Mirsky, who spoke earlier and criticised Oleg Orlov, saying that he should not use his status as a human rights defender to speak up against Mr Kadyrov. Any self-respecting democrat knows that you do not need a title, you do not need to be a human rights defender, and you do not need to be a member of Memorial or a Sakharov awardee to have the democratic right to criticise any head of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">I should also like to use this opportunity to endorse what our colleague Raül Romeva i Rueda said earlier. He called the attention of this Parliament – and also of the Commission and the Council and, in particular, Mrs Ashton – to the dangerous situation that is now developing in Western Sahara. I should like to request her to intervene so that the Moroccan authorities do not arrest the people of Western Sahara who are fighting against illegal occupation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank you for raising the human rights situation in the North Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="en">While the anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya was officially declared over last year, violence and the climate of impunity continue there, but even more so in neighbouring Dagestan and also in Ingushetia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The armed attack that took place on Tuesday of this week on the Parliament in Grozny was the latest reminder that the situation remains volatile and dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy/Vice-President Ashton has deplored this attack and has stated that no circumstances can justify the use of terrorist violence and suicide attacks.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims. In this case, the victims were a civilian and two policemen carrying out their duties. As terror attacks continue in the Northern Caucasus so too do regular attacks on human rights defenders and journalists, and the perpetrators of such attacks are rarely brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who continue their work in such an environment. Many activists, lawyers and independent journalists across the Russian Federation are facing violence, harassment and intimidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The libel cases against Oleg Orlov, the head of the Memorial Human Rights Centre and the chairwoman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Lyudmilla Alekseeva, should be seen in this context of intimidation. Mr Orlov’s statements, challenged by President Kadyrov, concerned the fact that the killer of Memorial activist Natalya Estimirova, although identified, has not been brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission is following Mr Orlov’s ongoing second trial very closely. The EU calls on Russia to uphold the commitments it has entered into as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. President Medvedev has spoken out against what he has termed the legal nihilism prevailing in Russia. The EU stands ready to support Russia’s reform of its judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concrete activities have been prepared in close cooperation with the President’s administration and the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU highly values the opportunity it has to discuss its concerns on human rights with the Russian authorities. We welcome the open attitude President Medvedev has taken in discussions with the EU concerning these issues. The regular EU-Russia human rights consultations at expert level offer an opportunity to broaden the scope of these discussions.</p>

      <p sl="en">I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and concern for the increasing number of murdered or disappeared citizens of the Caucasus region, particularly Natalia Estemirova. The increase in violence and disappearances of human rights activists and political opponents in the North Caucasus region since 2009 is worrying. These conflicts and human rights violations destabilise the region and hinder peace and prosperity. I urge the Russian authorities to heighten protection for human rights defenders, including those working for Memorial. The government should strive to convict those who carry out abductions and murders, rather than silencing those, like Oleg Orlov, who bring these issues to light. I condemn the actions taken by the authorities in investigating human rights organisations, as well as criminal charges currently being brought against Oleg Orlov for speaking out. I call on the Commission to emphasise these issues in its dialogue with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There has been a lot of talk in the media, recently, about a new beginning in relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation. The fruit of these activities is the joint German-Russian Nord Stream gas pipeline project and the offer to include Russia in the European security system proposed by Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It appears that in the euphoria of new economic agreements, EU decision makers have quickly forgotten the cases of Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. For years, we have based the Union on the belief that if people may be said to be equal, then this equality extends to all people in every respect. Therefore, it must be our priority to fight unremittingly for respect for the principles of law and order, civil liberties and human dignity. It is essential that there be a firm reaction from the European Union to the repeated cases of human rights violations in Russia and the tragedy of the democratic opposition.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The media are reporting that every 31st of the month, demonstrations organised by the ‘Strategy-31’ movement are held in Russian cities. Its members are protesting in defence of the freedom to gather, assemble and hold marches and pickets guaranteed under Article 31 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. From the beginning of its activities, the movement has met with opposition from the authorities. Each time, the demonstrations are broken up by the Special Purpose Police Unit OMON, and the participants are subjected to harassment and beatings, they are transported to the countryside and abandoned deep inside forests or they are arrested and even held in prison without being given a formal reason. It is the duty of the Union to investigate these activities in detail and to give strong expression to its opposition. This is expected of us, not only by the citizens of Russia, but by the whole of European society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Landsbergis, who knows the North Caucasus better than almost anyone else, has left a few brief oral amendments which tighten up the text and which I would ask you to support. I am presenting them on his behalf.</p>
      <p sl="de">In paragraph 3, we want to insert the word ‘real’ after ‘recognises Russia's right to fight’ and before ‘terrorism’ in order to make that clearer, because terrorism is often used as a pretext. In paragraph 5, we would like to insert the word ‘lasting’, so that this reads ‘stresses that the lasting impunity in Chechnya’. In paragraph 15, we want to add the word ‘intimidating’, so that the text reads ‘expresses its rejection of the intimidating search of human rights organisations’.</p>
      <p sl="de">These changes are simply intended to make the language of the report more precise and I would ask this House to accept them.</p>
