    <intervention id="4-008" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Court of Auditors">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to participate in the debate today on the European Court of Auditors’ annual report on the implementation of the 2009 budget, which I have already presented to you and to the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to present to the House the four key messages contained in this year’s annual report. First, the Court concludes that the accounts of the European Union give a fair presentation, and a true and fair view, of the financial position and the result of operations and cash flows. This is the third consecutive year the Court has found the accounts to be free from material misstatements and reliable.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards legality and regularity, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on revenue and commitments, as in previous years. However, and this is the second key message of this year’s annual report, payments from the budget continue to be materially affected by error, except in two areas. Those exceptions are administrative expenditure and economic and financial affairs.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all other areas of expenditure, the Court found material levels of error. I will focus on the two main areas of expenditure: agriculture and cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of agriculture and natural resources, the Court estimates the level of errors to be somewhat higher than in 2008. However, the results are consistent with the Court’s assessment, in both years, that systems are only partially effective. The Court recommends reducing the risk of error by improving the quality of information in the databases used for establishing entitlements and calculating payments, and by clarifying and enforcing rules on land usage and maintenance.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the area of cohesion, which represents almost a third of the budget, the situation remains that this is the only budgetary area where the estimated error is over 5%. Most of the errors found relate to serious failures by national authorities to apply rules on public procurement and to the reimbursement of ineligible costs. Many errors could, and should, have been detected and corrected by Member States before certifying expenditure to the Commission, as the audit shows they had the information to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we analyse this year’s results and compare them to last year, we see that the most significant change is in cohesion. That brings me to the Court’s third key message. The estimate for the most likely error in cohesion spending was significantly lower than in previous years, and for the budget as a whole, the Court’s estimate of errors has fallen over recent years.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a degree of caution is necessary before drawing any conclusions about the trend in this area; due to variations in spending patterns, the population of payments can change considerably from one year to the other – 2009 being notably different from 2008. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the overall fall in the estimated error rate over recent years will continue, so long as the systems covering the vast majority of disbursements remain only partially effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">That brings me to the last key message. The information provided by the Commission on recoveries and other corrections is not yet completely reliable and cannot be meaningfully compared with the Court’s estimated error rate.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are a number of initiatives before us which provide an important opportunity to improve the financial management of the European Union. This year’s annual report confirms the conclusions and the recommendations set out in the Court opinion on the risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the European Union. Improving the quality of spending should be a high priority. Simplifying the legislative framework and introducing more cost-effective control systems to reduce the risk of errors should contribute to this goal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Earlier this year, the Commission presented a draft recast Financial Regulation. In its recent opinion on this, the Court concludes that it contains a number of proposals that provide opportunities for the Commission to improve transparency and financial management. Simplification of sectoral legislation remains, however, an important route to a significant improvement in the quality of spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next year, the Commission will present legislative proposals for policies and programmes covering the main areas of expenditure in the next programming produced. When revising expenditure programmes, the Court suggests applying a set of principles to ensure that European added value is likely, that the objectives are clear, that the schemes are as realistic and simple as is reasonably possible, and that accountability is also clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ensuring the European funds are spent optimally places heavy responsibilities on all of us: on the Commission, when proposing legislation and implementing the budget; on the Member States in managing, day-to-day, some 80% of the European budget; on Parliament and on the Council as legislator and as the discharge authority; and on the Court as the Union’s external auditor.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court looks forward to playing its full part in efforts to ensure that the funds are spent correctly and are spent well.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, two days ago, President Caldeira and I already had the opportunity to exchange our views and to discuss the Court’s annual report with the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I would like here to outline the main points of the discussion and the very first conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before entering the heart of the matter, I would like to recall the fruitful dialogue between the auditor, the Court and the audit team in the Commission and to thank President Caldeira for this excellent cooperation. I am pleased with the Court’s recognition of progress made; I see indeed many positive messages; I also see some criticism and it is the Commission’s commitment to closely follow up on all the Court’s recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main messages of the Court’s report are key for the Commission’s own assessment of the way it assumes its responsibility in managing the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, for the third year in a row, the annual accounts have received an unqualified positive opinion. The Court has evaluated the EU accounts as giving a true and fair view without any reservation. The Commission is, of course, very satisfied with this result as it confirms the lasting effects of our accounting reform. However, the Court rightly highlights certain weaknesses. While none of these affects the Court’s unqualified opinion, the Commission is determined to address these weaknesses and therefore continues to improve its day-to-day accounting practices. With regard to the legality and regularity of transactions, I am pleased that the positive trend in the reduction of the overall error rate continued in 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">Revenue and commitments for the entire budget are legal and regular in all material respects. More than 95% of payments made from the EU budget are free from error. This verdict is a positive sign that our efforts to further improve control are having a concrete impact. This has been achieved mainly thanks to a substantial reduction of the error rate in cohesion; this progress reflects the Commission’s enhanced supervisory role through the ex-ante assessment of management and control systems of the Member States. It also reflects the merits of a rigorous approach in either interrupting or suspending payments where problems were identified.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in its report, the Court recognises the higher quality of the information about recoveries provided by the Commission, as disclosed in the accounts. The increase in the value of funds recovered from projects where errors were found or from national authorities responsible is indeed another sign of this Commission’s determination. However, I share the Court’s view that the Member States’ reporting is not yet satisfactory and the Commission will pursue its efforts to remedy this situation for the existing programmes, and also for the next generation of programmes and the shared management.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully share the caution of President Caldeira when he warns of possible oscillations of the error rate, in particular in cohesion, in the future. I also agree with the Court when it points out the weaknesses of the Member States’ systems and some other issues in shared management. In my view, the way forward includes the design of cost-effective control mechanisms; the simplification of eligibility rules where their complexity is an obvious source of errors; and the improvement of the quality of the information provided by the Member States regarding financial corrections and recoveries.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this list is not exhaustive. Our discussion on Tuesday showed that there are other challenges before us, for instance, a greater accountability for the key financial actors, in particular, the Member States, and a cost-effective control policy based on risk and performance. Moreover, in preparing the budget review, I have promoted the new focus on impact rather than input through the definition of clear and measurable objectives and key performance indicators. I presented last May my agenda on discharge, audit and anti-fraud for 2010-2014 in the Budgetary Control Committee of this House. This agenda outlined the key strategic objectives and concrete steps which the Commission will take to move further towards a positive Court statement of assurance. In the light of the Court’s 2009 annual report, this agenda remains fully relevant for our future actions.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I am pleased that the 2009 annual report corroborates that our efforts bear results. It constitutes an important and timely input to our reflection on how to achieve a more effective and efficient financial management of the EU budget which should guide us in preparing the next generation of programmes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, ladies and gentlemen, we have a very good day ahead of us, because for the first time, we can expect the Barroso II Commission to cross the 2% barrier. We do not really need the tolerable risk of error. This is why the Court of Auditors’ report that has been submitted to us definitely represents very good news, in particular, for all of those who are working in this area. It is clear that when the Commission makes a genuine and determined effort, it can come up with the results.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at these results in more detail, it is obvious that they are in part due to the changes in the regulations. This is definitely the case and this is the route which we must take in future. If the Commission could bring itself to revise the directive concerning public procurement and genuinely make things simpler for public bodies in the Member States, this would certainly be the biggest step that we could take towards a positive statement of assurance.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to say to everyone who constantly maintains that the European budget is exposed to major risks, it is true that European spending should certainly be subject to more consistent controls than national spending. European money is monitored more consistently and has to be accounted for more consistently than many areas of national budgets, as always becomes clear when we visit the Member States, because the national regulations have only been put in place as a result of the European regulations. Therefore, we simply need to encourage the Member States and call on them to subject their national spending to the same controls as European spending and vice versa.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank the Court of Auditors, but I would also like to say that I am disappointed by this annual report. I have already mentioned that the annual report contains significantly less information than it did in the past. We need details of the error rates. We have always been given this information for the structural funds, but this year, for the first time, we have not received it. We are not at nursery school here. We in Parliament rely on having this information. When I look back at the hearing involving the members of the Court of Auditors, I recall that they promised to work closely together with Parliament. I do not believe that this promise is being kept.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome the annual report and congratulate President Caldeira and all the Members of the Court for their excellent work. Allow me especially to thank Mr O’Shea for the excellent cooperation we had concerning the agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our role as a parliament is accountability towards the citizens, so we have to make sure that taxpayers’ money is used properly, transparently and effectively. I expect that the findings of the annual reports concerning the agencies, to be published later, will follow the same trend as in recent years. The situation is getting better, but there are still control systems to be improved, problems to be tackled and solutions to be found.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current major economic and social crisis, the significance of monitoring has become more important than ever before, and we in Parliament and the Court of Auditors are together committed to dealing with, and solving, the problems in order to achieve even better results.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Šemeta, Mr Caldeira, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for this report. Your organisation, Mr Caldeira, provides an essential service for European taxpayers. It is a good thing that the reduction in the error rate has continued this year. This is the result of the reform of the Commission which was pushed through by the liberal Commissioner, Mr Kallas. There are major improvements over the previous year in the area of cohesion and only a slight deterioration in agriculture. However, the Commission should not now simply sit back and do nothing. We must make it clear that the huge improvements are based on a very lucky choice of samples. Therefore, I am concerned that the positive trend will not continue next year. We should make use of the momentum from the first budget discharge under the Treaty of Lisbon to introduce a decisive paradigm shift.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make it clear once again that this year’s report from the Court of Auditors is the sixteenth in a row which does not have positive overall results. How can we finally bring an end to the inefficient and wasteful allocation of funding and to the political connivance in this area?</p>
      <p sl="de">My proposals as rapporteur are as follows: Firstly, the Commission must intervene more strongly in the case of obvious errors and, where these errors are repeated, it must suspend the funding. How is it that a Member State of many years standing like Greece is not subjected to sanctions over a period of 10 years, despite the fact that it is in obvious breach of the provisions of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS)?</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers. The beneficiaries of EU funding which has been allocated illegally are only required to repay 10%. In accordance with the 50:50 rule, the Member States contribute half of the amount from their national budgets. This is an insult to taxpayers. Let me give you a few figures. Between 1994 and 2006, the Member States have been wrongly allocated a phenomenal EUR 7.7 billion in the area of cohesion policy. The Commission itself has just made this fact public. Only EUR 709 million has been paid back, which demonstrates very clearly the difference in these circumstances. This is probably correct, because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations. The Court of Auditors has confirmed this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, all the Member States must finally sign and submit national management declarations. Fourthly, the Commission must be politically accountable. This is why we want signatures at least from Mr Barroso on the synthesis report on annual activities. We also want an evaluation report, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are still some things that are in need of improvement. All in all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I read this annual report, I experienced a feeling of déjà lu , a feeling that I was once again reading something that I had been reading for many years. First of all, in particular, too many material errors are occurring in the areas of agriculture, the Cohesion Fund, research and development, external aid, development cooperation and education. Secondly, the supervisory and control systems have been only partially effective in preventing and correcting reimbursement of claims for excessive or ineligible costs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, we are still faced with the fundamental problem that Member States are not doing what they ought to be doing, which is properly monitoring the money they pay out to beneficiaries. We are talking here about 80% of the European budget. Another fundamental problem that remains is that the Commission is not making sufficient efforts to monitor the activities of the Member States in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore endorse the rapporteur’s strategy, which will entail, on the one hand, ensuring that we demand, above all, national management declarations signed by ministers of finance and, on the other, ensuring that the Commission finally takes action against any Member States that remain in breach and, if need be, imposes tough sanctions: of a financial kind, for instance – withholding subsidies. That is, in my view, the path we need to follow.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Court of Auditors is a kind of great superintendent, we might say a policeman, a friendly policeman, although sometimes I have the impression that it turns a blind eye and is too good and too benevolent towards the institutions which it supervises. The conclusion of this report, the conclusion of the Court’s work is as follows: ‘good, but not perfect’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have the impression that many people in Europe are more pessimistic than the Court of Auditors. The Court must have a greater role, the Court must be credible, so that the European institutions will be credible in the eyes of the taxpayers and voters. However, for the Court to be credible, it must really be very scrupulous, because the Court is saying, today, that it is glad the glass is 95% full, while I think many taxpayers will ask: ‘but why is it 5% empty?’ All the more so, because there is a widespread belief that it is more than just 5% empty. I do agree with one conclusion – supervision at European level is sometimes more detailed, perhaps, than in Member States, and I call on the Court to exercise greater supervision in the Member States, where the money is quite simply frequently disappearing down the drain.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for an excellent report. As we have heard, overall, there has been a reduction in the number of errors being made. What should we make of this? In my opinion, this depends on two things: the starting point and our expectations. The starting point was horrendously poor. In 2008, billions of euro were paid out in contravention of the rules. Therefore, the expectations were that there should not only be improvements, but that there should be significant improvements in all areas.</p>
      <p sl="da">So, has this happened? Yes, in the area of cohesion, there has been a definite reduction in erroneous payments, which is a good thing, even if their level is still unacceptably high. In other areas, however, there has actually been a rise, which is quite simply not good enough.</p>
      <p sl="da">The other day in the Committee on Budgetary Control and again today, Commissioner Šemeta claimed that the overall reduction in the number of errors was a result of the Commission’s efforts. That is fine by me. I am happy to give the Commission the credit. In that case, however, it is also clear who will be responsible if the error rate increases next year. Please take that as an invitation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, year after year over the last 16 years, the auditors have been refusing to clear 90% or more of the budget, and this year is no exception. They talk about errors, but the nature of the irregularities they find goes far beyond that of a mistake. Suffice to say that such a situation would cause the closure of a company in the private sector and the conviction of its directors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fact is that taxpayers’ money has been unlawfully spent. This year, the auditors claim that at least GBP 6 billion should not have been paid out. What is the essence of the problem? The lack of responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission and the auditors will, as usual, blame the Member States, but the fact is that the failure resides within the Commission due to the lack of proper controls. The Commission is in the best position to establish the rules and to sanction those who breach them, but it has failed all along and this Parliament also bears responsibility, as it has approved the situation every year and keeps asking for an increase in the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no hope any more that the EU budget will ever be cleared by the auditors. At this point, the only way to protect taxpayers’ money is to reduce the EU budget drastically.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now I address the British Prime Minister. Mr Cameron, in accepting a 2.9% increase for the 2011 EU budget, you have failed dramatically. On behalf of British taxpayers, I hereby request that you lead the demand for a significant reduction of the 2011 budget.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is true that the error rate in the area of cohesion has fallen significantly from 54% in 2007 to 36% in 2009. That is correct. It is a fact, and even I have to acknowledge that. However, as the rapporteur has already said, if you look more closely at how these figures have been produced, it is obvious that they must be seen in relative terms. It is also a fact that, according to this report from the Court of Auditors, the control systems in the area of cohesion are not effective. In addition, it is a fact that at least 3% of the money should not have been paid out at all. This means that there is still a great deal for Mr Hahn to do, among others, to put this portfolio in order.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my opinion, the increase in the error rates in the area of agriculture is obviously a retrograde step. Furthermore, wastefulness, in cases for example, where subsidies for miners are paid to billionaires, is not counted as an error.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have already mentioned in the committee that I have not received an answer either from the Court of Auditors or from the Commission with regard to the social security benefits which have been paid twice. Once again, my question is: Who made the error in this case? Will the money be paid back and how big is the amount involved? Finally, I would like to say that it is important in future for the Court of Auditors not only to check that payments are being made legally, but also to ensure that they are cost-effective and efficient.</p>

      <p sl="ro">First of all, I wish to thank Victor Caldeira for this clear report, which is relevant to the Commission’s activities and the implementation of the 2009 budget. Secondly, I want to clarify from the start something of vital importance to us: once every five years, we are elected and sent to the European Parliament by Europe’s citizens, the people who pay taxes and duties and who ultimately make this budget. From their point of view, based on the fact that we regularly go back home and meet with them, the implementation of the 2009 budget cannot be regarded as a success. Let me give you just two reasons for this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Firstly, the national management declarations made are not supported politically. In other words, there is no signature either from the minister for finance or the prime minister. As a result, we do not know who is responsible for these national management declarations and to what extent they are comprehensible and accurate. In practical terms, this paves the way for false reporting and, if not false, then at least incomplete.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, where errors have been made in the management of European funds, every state must pay the money back to the Commission. In other words, Europe’s citizens pay money once to create the European budget and, on the other hand, as losers, they again cover the loss in the national budget. Therefore, the citizens of the European Union pay twice for the mistakes, errors or even fraudulent acts committed in the management of European funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Thirdly, I support the Commission and the European Court of Auditors. I, too, am in favour of closer ties between this institution and the national audit bodies in each Member State. I believe that if we want to have more money in the budget, we must spend better, in the first place, the money we have. To spend better the money we have, we must first of all know where problems are and how we can solve them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that if we can now talk about a reduction in errors, we owe this to the skill, independence and professionalism of the Court of Auditors, and I should like President Caldeira to take note of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that, as well as the Commission, Parliament played an important part in this improvement, in particular, the Committee on Budgetary Control, which sets great store by the subject of transparency and the effective and efficient use of public funds.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must still see what we can do to improve, however, because there are still too many things that are not right, particularly in very sensitive sectors such as agriculture and cohesion, with often worrying error rates in sectors where fraud in areas such as contracts and over-invoicing is rife. I believe that it is necessary to lower the rate of bureaucracy and reduce pointless red tape and instead introduce a few clear rules to send out a very clear and determined ‘no’ to every form of fraud in sectors where corruption is endemic.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important factor is to step up the role of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, to combat all forms of fraud and corruption. Another aspect that we cannot fail to emphasise – we learned this also from a recent visit by the Committee on Budgetary control to Italy – is that there is also a risk of the forceful influence of organised crime and forms of corruption on public funds. The role of OLAF could therefore be essential from this viewpoint, together with greater cooperation between Member States, the Commission and Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another absolutely essential point is that I believe the Commission must strengthen its independence from Member States. I believe that we must block funds to prevent repetition of this type of behaviour, particularly in states where serious errors – I am not talking about minor errors – and very substantial episodes of fraud have been going on for years.</p>
      <p sl="it">The credibility level of the European Parliament and the European institutions is determined greatly by the level of transparency and correctness with which public funds are spent. I therefore believe that we have room for improvement on this score.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, although the Court of Auditors states that the accountability of European expenditure has improved, it has failed to grant a full declaration of assurance for the expenditure. That is partly because, while some improvement has indeed been shown as regards the second largest item, cohesion, there are still errors in approximately 40% of the projects. Thus, out of a total budget of EUR 35 billion, there are EUR 2 billion for which no declaration of assurance could be granted. I find that unacceptable; the Commission, in particular, should therefore thoroughly investigate how these errors could have arisen and how they might be reduced. This is especially important in consideration of the discharge of the 2009 budget.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yesterday, Mr Engwirda, a member of the Court, stated that the errors were primarily due to the complexity of the procedures. That again demonstrates that it is imperative that Europe become simpler and more transparent. If that does not happen, our citizens will continue to see Europe as complicated and overly remote.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to ask Mr van Dalen whether he is aware that the high percentages refer only to the percentage of the sample. In other words, it is not 36% of the payments that are in error, but 36% of the payments in the sample. If this is extrapolated up, the result is at least 5% in the case of the Cohesion Fund. Therefore, the billions that you referred to are not accurate amounts. Were you aware of this?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I fully understood that. The real issue for me is that no declaration of assurance can be given for billions of euro, which is why I have asked the Commission to investigate that thoroughly and also to examine how the situation might be improved. Fortunately, the Commissioner has already indicated in his speech a minute ago that he will initiate such an investigation and that he will take the matter seriously.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, estimates provided by the European Court of Auditors show that EUR 6 million disappeared from the European budget in 2009 as a result of carelessness, mismanagement, fraud, ignorance and a lack of checks. The Court of Auditors has revealed the scandalous fact that around 40% of EU officials are receiving double the normal amount of family benefits. Greece is once again causing problems. It has not only been bailed out by other Member States with a rescue package amounting to billions of euro, but is also the front-runner when it comes to subsidy fraud. You only need to look at the wooded areas for which Greece has claimed subsidies for green spaces to see the sheer audacity of its behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, the situation is particularly bad when it comes to the regional subsidies. As the previous speaker has said, if 36% of the payments that were checked were made in error, that is bad enough. This is why we are calling on Mr Hahn to take drastic measures with regard to his very important portfolio. We do not have money to give away.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to compliment the committed employees of the Court of Auditors. They are highly motivated and we politicians should be encouraging them to make even more careful checks. As politicians, we are in a position to draw up and implement guidelines.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, I think that in discussing this report, we must take care to be sufficiently precise in our statements, because we are very often also talking, here, about errors, irregularities or embezzlement. The report shows very clearly that in terms of the error rate found for cohesion policy, there has been a definite reduction. It is at a level of around 5%, in relation to which we cannot at the same time talk about errors at a level of 20, 30 or 40%, because this simply confuses the overall picture. We have, here, a clear improvement in what certainly is a very complicated policy, since it is managed jointly with the Member States. A problem for all of us is how to improve this policy, which has a structure which is simply very demanding and very complicated but which has huge added value. The situation is changing, and this should be noted with satisfaction and stated positively.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I would like to draw attention to a certain disturbing part of the report, and I quote: ‘Taking this into consideration, the Court concludes that it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between its own estimate of error rates and the data for financial corrections and recoveries supplied by the Commission.’ I think this statement is very important and significant for the future, because we do not want a situation in which the Court concludes that it cannot reach agreement with the Commission about results. More work is needed, here, and this matter needs to be explained.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for once again providing us with an excellent tool for evaluating our use of money within the EU. Fortunately, we can confirm that we are moving in the right direction, even though there are still many problems. However, because things are moving in the right direction, I think we should use the time to take a closer look at what the next step should be. If we look at the situation with regard to administrative expenditure, for example, we can see that we have an effective control system and few errors. In my opinion, however, this is not enough. We also need to take time to examine whether we are actually using the money in the right way.</p>
      <p sl="da">Administrative expenditure is our expenditure on salaries, buildings and such like. In this regard, we ought to ask ourselves whether we are really getting enough for the money that we spend on salaries. Are we using the money in the right way in respect of how we manage our buildings, etc.? I believe that we now need to take the debate a step further so that we discuss the question of whether it is efficient enough, and so that we also obtain a significantly greater degree of transparency with regard to this. I therefore call not only on the European Parliament, but on the Commission, too, to demonstrate a considerable willingness to provide greater transparency and to engage in this debate.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is now the second time in the current session that the annual accounts of the European Union have come up for discussion. In the first place, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr da Silva Caldeira and his team for the work they have done. On the other hand, I am surprised at the level of error that is again occurring in almost 92% of budget expenditure, counting all chapters with the exception of administrative expenditure and economic affairs. I would like to ask to what extent are the Member States responsible for these errors and to what extent is a lack of control on the part of the Commission responsible.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The answer indicated in the report is that there are many deficiencies in the actual control systems of the Member States. I believe that what we need most of all is greater cooperation and openness from the Member States, if such large-scale errors are to be prevented.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, the Court of Auditors have done an excellent job drafting the report auditing the EU budget for 2009, and Mr Caldeira and the members of the Court of Auditors deserve credit for their work. I agree with those speakers who have said that the report shows clearly and unambiguously that there is an improving trend as regards the use of EU funds and that the overall error rate is falling. Nevertheless, we need to draw clear and obvious consequences from the report as to what we have to do here in Parliament, in the Commission and in the other EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The falling error rate, however, means nothing less than that, according to the Court of Auditors, several billion euro of EU funds have been used incorrectly or irregularly, which may even give rise to the suspicion of crime. This means that action has to be taken. There is one measure in particular which I would like to mention, namely, that it would be extremely important that the Court of Auditors prepare a breakdown by Member States in the next period to show the extent of the error rate in the use of EU funds and the standard of operation of the control mechanism in each state. This, too, may contribute to a further reduction in the error rate.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, once again, we welcome the improvements introduced through the intense dialogue between the Court of Auditors, the Commission and, of course, Parliament. This year’s report, however, also shows that we cannot rest on our laurels, and that we need to remain vigilant.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also think that Mr da Silva Caldeira’s proposal for the future regarding cooperation to improve and simplify the important aspects of the Financial Regulation is very positive, as are the new legislative proposals on which we could perhaps work together to achieve a successful result.</p>
      <p sl="es">With regard to the other institutions, I will be paying very close attention to all the aspects related to the Council’s operating expenditure, especially the Secure European System for Applications in a Multi-vendor Environment system, in which there is a specific reference to the need for improvements in forecasting the Council’s budget, and also to isolated aspects relating to the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, whose budgets appear to be severely reduced. I am also interested, however, in the fact that we have had information that a case has been passed on to the European Anti-Fraud Office in relation to the Economic and Social Committee. In addition, I would like to know the opinion regarding the significant increase in staff in the Committee of the Regions between 2009 and 2010.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, it is vitally important that we emphasise the fact that the Court of Auditors’ conclusions acknowledge the progress which has been made by the Commission in controlling the absorption of European funds. However, at the same time, I hope that the recommendations and proposals made by the European Parliament in the discharge reports, reiterated for years on end, will actually be taken into consideration, especially in the areas where we still have a high level of irregularities. The quality of the information supplied to us by the Court of Auditors should be even better as well. I believe that we should really be given the precise figures and level of irregularities which we need to know.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The good news for 2009 is that the level of irregularities in the area of cohesion policy has fallen significantly compared to last year. However, the big question remains whether this reduction will be sustainable over time or is simply a fluke which may also be due to the specific countries chosen to be audited.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, in any event, there are unresolved issues on the agenda, linked to irregularities in the areas of external aid, development and enlargement, agriculture, research, energy and transport, education and citizenship.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I want to assure the Court of Auditors, the Commission and Council that our work in the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control will be very extensively and essentially focused over the coming months on making the management of European funds more efficient.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We will continue to emphasise the responsibilities which need to be assumed in this regard by the European Commission and Member States and strictly adhered to, as well as the measures to be taken against offenders in order to achieve a real result in protecting the interests of the European taxpayer.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Caldeira, Mr Šemeta, cohesion policy is the sick man of the EU budget. Last year, he was in intensive care and this year he is convalescing. However, he is far from making a full recovery and he could have a relapse at any time. More than 5% of all the cohesion policy payments were in error and 3% should not have been made at all. This amounts to around EUR 700 million. A large proportion of these erroneous payments could have been prevented by the Member States. The errors are occurring in public procurement and in the payment of cohesion funding, despite the existing control systems, which have been approved by the Commission. We need to take another careful look at these control systems. In my home country of Germany, the samples showed that all the control systems there which had been tested were only partially effective.</p>
      <p sl="de">The responsibility for managing the budget lies with the Commission. We can discuss this contradiction – errors in the Member States which are the responsibility of the Commission – in our home countries, we can explain it to the media and we can tell our citizens about it. However, in political terms, it is the job of the Commission to resolve this problem in the Member States. Mr Šemeta, you need to take control in this area and you will have our support for doing so.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, representatives of the Commission and the Court of Auditors, I rise as coordinator for regional policy of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>
      <p sl="nl">Looking at the error rate, I see that a clear improvement has been made in terms of cohesion. We can now see the impact of the new regulations we adopted for the 2007-2013 period and of the action plans which were keenly advocated, not only by Parliament, but also by both the current and previous Commission. Most of the problems, or errors, are to be found in the public procurement dossier. Transposition of European legislation into the laws of a number of Member States and the associated implementation have driven up the error rate to its present very high level.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I therefore ask the Commissioners to come up with an action plan that would, amongst other things, put pressure on Member States or support them with regard to public procurement. Last week, I had the opportunity of heading a European Parliament delegation to Romania and we were able to see how they were struggling with this and what kind of difficulties they were up against. We could make a lot of progress here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I, too, am very much in favour of national management declarations; that is, financial declarations that Member States would be required to submit, because Member State level is precisely where most of the faults lie.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to be as positive as I possibly can about this report, because I always believe that we should use audits to improve things and to learn from our mistakes. There are many examples where this can be done by the Commission, by Member States and by beneficiaries in order to improve matters, for example, in agriculture. Constant changes in requirements by the Commission cause difficulties for Member States and beneficiaries; in Wales, they tell me that all the time. To reduce claims for ineligible land by farmers, the Commission could also provide legislation which clearly defines active farmers across the EU, which would then be used by all Member States, whereas at the moment, they have some discretion. Lastly, with CAP reform imminent, there is a golden opportunity to simplify the processes to ensure that in Europe, we have value for money for our spending, but also continue to provide benefits for individuals and communities.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, presentation of the results of the European Court of Auditors’ work always gives superb information which enables a comparison of what things were like in the past with what should be done in the future. What can the general conclusion be? It seems to be the case that wherever procedures are less complicated and it is easier to use money, we find fewer material errors. The more complicated the policy, the more the significance of errors, and sometimes also of irregularities, rises. One such example is cohesion policy, which is also very important for the European Union. This is why it has also been concluded, here, that the Union’s agricultural policy has a high error rate, but where procedures for the use of funds have been simplified, there are fewer errors than where it is more complicated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to draw attention to the significance of cooperation with national supervisory bodies, but also – and this has not been spoken about – the significance of cooperation with national parliaments and, in particular, with committees for European affairs, budgets and budgetary control. I personally was a member of the Polish national parliament at the time when we started working with information from the European Court of Auditors, and it was very well received by the members.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to offer my very sincere thanks to the Court of Auditors. This report is an impressive demonstration of the fact that the controls are constantly improving. I am not necessarily concerned by the error rates that have been highlighted, because I believe that the auditing process is a learning system. It involves looking more and more closely at the problems and, thank goodness, discovering an increasing number of errors. Our task is to work together to avoid these errors occurring in future. Therefore, I would like to draw everyone’s attention once again to the Fifth Cohesion Report which was presented yesterday. The Commission is inviting everyone involved to express their opinions about the questions raised in this document. This represents a major opportunity to lay the foundations for future subsidy arrangements which will ensure, on the one hand, that subsidies in this area are easier to obtain, that access is simplified and red tape reduced, and that, on the other, the necessary strict controls are in place to protect the taxpayers’ money which is being used.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I am calling on everyone involved to comply with this request from the Commission. We in Parliament will, of course, do so.</p>

    <intervention id="4-036" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, the debate today demonstrates that further progress was achieved in 2009 in the management of the European budget. The clear opinion of the Court on the accounts and the lowest error rate ever for the whole budget, as disclosed by our external auditor, confirm that the Commission took the right decisions and proposed adequate measures to improve the performance of the programmes under the current financial period.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Court also highlights the areas where further progress is needed by all financial actors. I refer, of course, to the Commission, and also to financial actors in the Member States whose obligations and responsibilities under shared management have been clearly reinforced under the new Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you talked here about the application of sanctions to the Member States, and I have to say that the Commission applies sanctions very rigorously. Just now, we are in the process of the suspension or interruption of 40 cohesion programmes amounting to EUR 1.75 billion. That is a huge amount, and what is more important is that the number of actions in 2010 almost doubled compared with the number of actions in 2009. Just last Friday, we also made a decision to call back unduly spent money in agriculture to an amount of more than EUR 578 million; so we really apply these sanctions rigorously and we intend to do so in the future. You can also see from the report by the Court of Auditors that the level of recoveries and financial corrections has increased significantly over the years, amounting in 2009 to EUR 3.3 billion. That is also a very significant amount, and our intention is to continue this policy and apply sanctions very rigorously when this is needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court’s report, and the discharge procedures starting now, will be instrumental not only in addressing the weaknesses of the current programmes but also in drawing lessons for the next generation of programmes. The Court rightly pointed out the way forward, which is, of course, simplification and improvements in the procurement rules, because it is true that the vast majority of errors were made because of the violation of eligibility criteria or of procurement rules. We have to learn lessons from this, and the Commission is ready to do so. It will follow up on the Court’s recommendations and is looking forward to a fruitful discharge procedure.</p>

    <intervention id="4-037" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Court of Auditors">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for all the kind comments that you have addressed to the Court on this occasion, as a tribute also to those who work in our institution each day addressing, with the highest professional standards, and in accordance with international audit standards, the concerns of this institution. We pay due attention to the recommendations of this House and let me just give you two examples of what we have done in this annual report for 2009 to address the request from this institution for more information.</p>
      <p sl="en">We provide you with an overall assessment of the situation; for the first time, we say what the overall situation is. We conclude that it has improved over recent years; the most likely errors for the whole budget are decreasing. We have also provided you, in particular in the area of cohesion, with more information than last year, because last year we said that at least 11% of the funds should not have been paid; this year, we are able to say that the most likely error estimated is indeed over 5%, which we could not say last year, and that at least 3% of the funds should not have been reimbursed. This is the measure of the progress we have found. These are facts. Why? What are the reasons behind this? What progress have we achieved? We are not inventing facts; we are not being kind to the Commission or kind to the Member States. The Court is an independent audit institution governed by the treaty. We base our findings on the evidence and it is what we report to this institution, which we have the obligation to assist in this discharge procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are willing to assist you in this work and the main reason for this, as we said in our report, is that on the one hand, the systems put in place to manage the funds for this programme period 2007-2013 are performing better. The other reason is that the disbursement of funds for the programming period is only 25%, so the financial execution for the period is, in our evidence, lower than what should be expected. So the combination of these two factors – better performance of the systems on the one hand and lower execution, so fewer payments effectively made, on the other – has given us the situation where we now are. This is where we have this word of caution. We have to see how things evolve now with the systems behaving so well across all the 27 Member States and with all the funds to be disbursed in the future. So a word of caution.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I said that we are willing to assist this House, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control, in its discharge. Our Members will assist you with that and provide you with all the information you need. But we are also assisting you through our special reports. You can find audits and other elements which look at the impact of the funding in real life, at how effectively they have been used, and I think that this is very valuable information for this institution also.</p>
      <p sl="en">Clearly, the responsibility for implementing the budget lies primarily with the European Commission, but the Lisbon Treaty says also in cooperation with the Member States. If we have to look forward, I would say that we now have a unique opportunity to build a new momentum for a better management of the European Union budget. A new Financial Regulation is being discussed and will be adopted soon and that will be the basic line to decide and guide the management for future progress. If we have to have simple rules, if we want to have more efficient, cost-effective systems to manage them through the Member States and within the Commission, that is the moment to address those issues. The budget review is also on the table next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament are therefore confronted now with a period for taking serious decisions to improve the situation in the future. If the European Court of Auditors can assist in that, I would suggest it should be by building on the recommendations that we have already put forward in our opinion on the key risks and challenges for improving the financial management of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">When you look to the new generation of programmes for the period after 2013, I repeat, we have to ask: are the programmes of funding schemes likely to add value to the European Union? Are we putting forward schemes which are simple, with clear objectives, realistic to execute and whose accountability lines are clear? We want to avoid the uncertainty where we are sometimes claiming that there is no responsibility either on the side of the Commission or on the side of the Member States. We have the opportunity now and the Court of Auditors is looking forward to assisting you in this task.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For the first time in 16 years, the European Court of Auditors has issued a positive statement of assurance with regard to both the reliability of the annual accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. This is the end of a cycle that began with the Santer Commission, which resigned in 1999. This situation is due to the determination of the European Parliament and of its Committee on Budgetary Control to force the Commission and also the Member States – in matters relating to shared management – to manage European public funds correctly. I welcome the Court’s work. I fail to understand why the Union does not enter into its accounts the EUR 37.2 billion that the Member States owe for staff pensions, since it has approximately EUR 44 billion negative own capital as a result. What an image to portray! I wonder how we are going to be able to borrow on the markets to raise the EUR 60 billion needed for the stability plan. Lastly, I believe that this report has come too late. In any serious organisation, the auditor’s report should be sent before 30 June in the year following the year audited. The quibbles about the complex issues and the many languages involved are not acceptable.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Court of Auditors is now submitting its sixteenth report, through which it issues the statement of assurance concerning the legality and regularity of the operations on which the annual accounts of the EU budget are based. I would like to stress that the level of error in some operations remains high. For example, the Court of Auditors states that, for projects in the area of cohesion, the level of error is higher than 5%, which, in my opinion, is too high, despite the fact that there has been an improvement in recent years. In my opinion, the European Commission should make every effort to reduce the error level to the maximum acceptable level of 2%. It has to be said, of course, that the error level does not always indicate incorrect handling of delegated resources, but is often down to accounting errors in the administration of individual projects.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In its annual report on the implementation of the 2009 budget, the Court observes in relation to the reliability of the accounts that some consolidated entities have not provided any statement in relation to their consolidated accounts, or have submitted an amended statement. The European Police College (CEPOL) is one of the entities for which the due information has been lacking for several years. This has important consequences, because, after an in-depth audit of CEPOL’s accounts in July 2010, corrections were made to the accounts. Indeed, the 2009 financial report for the agency went back over the accounting management of the financial years 2008 and earlier, estimating the budgetary impact of the corrections at approximately 13% of the agency’s current budget. Since the college became a community agency on 1 January 2006, the Court of Auditors has only issued reservations on the reliability of the accounts for the financial year 2007. That has not sufficed to put the accounts prior to 2010 back in order.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mrs Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy (COM(2010)0283 – C7-0139/2010 – 2010/0150(COD)) (A7-0246/2010).</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you see before you a very happy rapporteur, because I think that we – and I very much emphasise the we – have produced a report that will hopefully soon be adopted almost unanimously, as all political groups in Parliament have worked intensively on it and in close cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The report and the regulations it addresses have a lengthy history in this House. It had its origins, specifically, in the recovery plan launched in 2009 in the wake of the economic crisis. At the time, EUR 4 billion was freed up at European level, and these funds were earmarked specifically for economic recovery. The objective was that that money should also finance energy projects in particular: large-scale energy projects, devoted to carbon capture and storage, to infrastructure, and to a number of large offshore wind energy projects.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At that time, Parliament having of course approved these projects, there were quite a few objections from various quarters and from Parliament itself, especially vis-à-vis the large-scale nature of the undertaking and the question of whether this or that project would create enough jobs. However, the most important criticism regarded energy efficiency. This was followed by a political agreement and the current situation is the result of that agreement.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You would think that if Parliament, the Council and the Commission reach a political agreement about investing all surpluses in energy efficiency, that the report and the negotiations would be easy. That was not the case. We have been through some difficult negotiations, especially with the Council. However, I can say that we – and we did have to reach a compromise, let us be clear about that – were able to score a home run on most of the points. I would like to run through them briefly because they are crucial to a proper understanding of the current situation concerning the funds and how they should be implemented in the very near future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, this is about renewable energy projects but, in particular, those which focus on energy efficiency. That, Commissioner, is what lies at the heart of the energy debate these days. I am very much in favour of renewable energy, but we know that, if we want really rapid results, we have to invest all our efforts in energy efficiency: it is a good solution if you want to reduce consumption; it helps alleviate the major problem of energy supply and – a very important point – it ensures lower energy costs for our companies and families. That is incredibly important. We are also working on industrial policy and we will definitely get back to you on that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, and this is very much linked to energy efficiency, the local level. Very often, Europe works almost exclusively with national Member States, and even the previous recovery plan focused primarily on major projects. Well, this one could not be more different. It focuses on the local level, on cities and municipalities, on small-scale projects which can be implemented immediately, delivering immediate results, and which can thereby have a major impact, not just on energy efficiency but also on jobs. That remains a very important consideration.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, funding. The previous major recovery plan consisted of what we call upfront funding; simply subsidising major projects, whether by means of cofinancing or not, because that is specific to Europe. It is the typical way in which Europe works. However, that is not the case with this fund and, for that reason, it is very innovative. The way resources are used here is by providing support in order to get those projects funded through guarantees and other financial means. With the exception of technical assistance, which is still funded through upfront funding, this means that you will have major leveraging. You need to multiply those EUR 146 million by approximately eight in order to get an idea of what the impact could be.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have now come to my last point, over which we have squabbled for a long time: the cap on money; that is, the money that is available to us. Parliament would have liked to see a different solution; which, indeed, was what we had agreed, let us be clear about that. Any remaining funds had to be invested in this project. We have reached a compromise: all the funds that are left over today have been registered and I firmly believe that this will mean that this project will be assured a long life – and I think that, if we carry on working together as we have done, we will also be able to ensure that it becomes incredibly successful for us.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Just one more second, Madam President. I know I have run out of time. I would once again like to expressly thank everyone who has worked on this, in particular, all the shadow rapporteurs. I was particularly pleased with our cooperation, and I am not saying that out of politeness, but simply because it was an example of very fine and effective cooperation. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are discussing the interim review of a successful programme to aid economic recovery in the energy sector. Up to this point, as part of the implementation of the programme established for us by Parliament and the Council, we have made 43 financing decisions for gas projects, energy infrastructure projects, offshore energy and carbon capture and storage. This has allowed us to spend around 98% of the entire budget of EUR 3.98 billion and to ensure that the programme has, to a large extent, achieved its objectives. There were only a few projects which could not be implemented. We are introducing this amendment regulation with the aim of meeting Parliament’s requirements and initiating pilot projects for renewable energy, but importantly, also for energy efficiency. I regard these pilot projects as an opportunity to trial our activities in the field of energy efficiency, which will be one of the focal points of my work over the next year.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Mrs Van Brempt very warmly. I would also like to thank all the strident Members of this House and the Belgian Presidency, because we have worked hard in this area over recent weeks and we are able to present a document today which will definitely provide a stimulus in the area of energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to ensure that this amendment regulation, which is due to come into force now, takes effect quickly, our officials have already been making preparations for its implementation. In the next few days, EUR 146 million will be made available for projects which are important to all of you. Our partners in these projects, chosen by you, are municipal, local and regional authorities which have close links with the projects in question. These local partners will ensure that the funding is used in the best possible way, for public buildings, private buildings, combined heat and power facilities, district heating networks, decentralised renewable energy sources, more environmentally friendly urban transport systems and local infrastructures, such as intelligent networks, efficient street lighting and smart measurement systems. This means that we are doing something which will have an immediate local impact and which will act as a benchmark for my future activities relating to smart cities.</p>
      <p sl="de">If you make the appropriate decision today, our offices will begin implementing the amendment regulation straight away. In March or April of next year, we will definitely be able to report that our economic recovery programme is having a very positive effect, in the form of both large projects and small, decentralised projects, and is allowing us to learn lessons which will be important in future financial years. I would like to thank everyone concerned once again.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets concerning Mrs Van Brempt’s report, I can say that the members of the committee very much welcomed this report. We have looked at it not only from a budgetary perspective, but also, to certain extent, with regard to its content and we have raised one concern, which Mrs Van Brempt was kind enough to include. This instrument is aimed at municipalities and rightly so, because this is where the greatest increases in efficiency can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I come from an area of Germany where the municipalities cannot take out any additional loans, because they are already too heavily in debt. This may be a problem specific to Germany, because of our local authority constitutions, but Mr Oettinger, as a former head of a Federal German state, will be only too familiar with this subject. Therefore, in Germany, we are in a position where those local authorities which should be making use of this programme are not allowed to, because the body responsible for supervising them has prevented them from taking on any further debt. We are very concerned about this. It could result in this programme being ineffective in these areas. We welcome this programme and would be pleased if it could be continued. We have called for the programme to have a separate budget line and we would like to transfer to it the EUR 15 million available in the agricultural policy area which cannot be accessed there because there is no legal basis for doing so. This is where the budget needs to be more flexible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the decision to use the few remaining funds in the Recovery Plan started in 2009 in a different way and to take advantage of this opportunity to introduce a new principle with the setting up of an ad hoc fund is far-sighted and in line with what we have been saying for some time in this Chamber but have never been able to act on.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have seen a few timid signs, not yet brought up to date, in the Marguerite Fund. This represents, for us and for the PPE, a benchmark method to be followed for intelligent use of the European Union budget. The instrument is an ad hoc fund that deploys various methods such as loans, guarantees, equity shares or cofinancing, and will be governed by a special asset management company.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fund was set up with an initial sum of EUR 147 million and we do not understand why the door cannot be left open for the other residues due to the Recovery Plan. A significant sum could be raised by applying significant leverage through the EIB, the KfW, the Deposit and Loan Banks and other financial institutions, and this could have a great impact on the start-up of projects considered valid and given economic and environmental priority.</p>
      <p sl="it">From my point of view, the central aspect of the fund that will be set up by the end of this year is that it could become a kind of virtuous pilot project for the future organisation of a broader energy fund for appropriate inclusion in the next financial perspective 2014-2020. This principle could also be repeated for other sectors, such as TEN or eTEN networks. If you would allow me, some tangible sign at this critical time in the face of an employment crisis would make us all a little happier.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, because far beyond the EUR 146 million that have been agreed, the impact of which we hope will be eight-fold, this initiative has important symbolic value.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the rapporteur explained, we are going to allocate funds to sustainable energy micro-projects, which will not only enable the realisation of important objectives such as security of supply and reducing CO2 emissions, but will also achieve an objective that has a very direct impact on the population: reducing energy poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">The text that we are going to vote on is also important because it introduces an innovative financial instrument. This mechanism will help to overcome the resistance of financial entities to this type of project, as they will have the backing of international financial institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, we should once again be satisfied that we have been sufficiently flexible to respect the good practice created in the Member States in order to structure the deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="es">I hope that the implementation of this regulation will enable all the potential of those bodies to be developed, without the obstacles that tend to be imposed by excessive bureaucracy.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the preparation of this report on energy projects and for the additional funds now provided by the Commission. EUR 146 million has been provided for projects which will be crucial for Europe and for the various countries and, in particular, as the Commissioner has said, for the local and regional authorities which will, I hope, be handling this money or these grants.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I first of all want to congratulate the rapporteur on the presentation of her report on financial assistance for energy projects.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I strongly welcome this initiative, which provides for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. The financing of projects in this area will help to stimulate economic recovery in Europe, and indeed in my own country, Ireland, and help to create new employment opportunities and also help in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In all parts of Europe now, and particularly in my own country with a very high rate of unemployment, we want to ensure that all funding can be diverted into areas where jobs can be created. The funding of EUR 146 million which is available under the amended proposal must be targeted towards projects that will have a rapid, a measurable and a real impact on economic recovery. EUR 146 million is the funding that is available, but there is a multiplier of at least six or seven times that amount, which will be the overall investment.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I believe that the establishment of a dedicated financial instrument will allow for this funding to be administered in the most efficient manner and the beneficiaries, as I said in my own native language, will include local and regional authorities. We all have a responsibility to bring this to the attention of those authorities, and our government will be making an individual application and then liaise with the regional authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, today we celebrate a victory, albeit small, for green energy policy and a more European energy policy. I firstly want to thank our excellent delegation from all parties, under the leadership of Kathleen. I think we did a good job.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to praise Mr Oettinger. Unfortunately, during the presentation of the energy agenda yesterday, we were obliged to be highly critical. However, this instrument has also come about because you have made a personal effort, in part in the face of opposition from the German Government and your partners in the Christian-Democratic Union in Germany, to ensure that it was able to happen.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why is it a small and bitter victory? Because – and some have said this – this is EUR 150 million for the decentralised, the local, energy investments, where, on the other hand, we have billions – one billion for carbon sequestration, for example. I am still wondering if this one billion will be used. We are getting increasing indications that this project will not work. There is no balance between the decentralised, near-to-the-citizens, local-area projects and the big projects, some of which will, I think, fail.</p>
      <p sl="de">Why are we, as Greens, nevertheless voting for this project today? It is because we are optimists. We are optimistic that this EUR 150 million, well managed, will create the base for a much bigger instrument which we will get under the next financial perspective. There are two conditions for that. The first condition is quality projects. I think that the EIB and KfW, which will manage it, will also look at deep renovation, and not only shallow renovation, projects. We need to leapfrog, especially when it comes to buildings and efficiency. The second condition is cutting the red tape for the local authorities that will apply for projects to get cofinancing.</p>
      <p sl="de">These two issues are crucial. Therefore, my questions to you, Commissioner, are: what will the Commission do to make sure that this fund will finance or give credit to quality projects? And how will the Commission act to cut red tape so that local authorities have easy access to these funds?</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I will endorse every proposal to increase Union funds for supporting energy projects. Green energy should also be supported. However, it should be said honestly that the idea that green energy is the solution to all of Europe’s energy problems – a kind of thinking which is often expressed here – is an illusion. However, the Union does need large, and I stress large, investments. The basic purpose of these is to ensure diversification of fuel supply. Such a solution is possible, for example, by building the Nabucco gas pipeline to connect the huge gas deposits in the region of Central Asia with customers in Europe and by developing transmission networks and building new interconnectors in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We do want to develop green energy, but at the same time, unfortunately, development of methods for extraction of shale gas is being completely overlooked and is not being appropriately funded. This is an unconventional gas which is already playing an enormous role in extraction in the United States and is giving America complete independence in terms of access to gas. Large amounts of this gas are found in France, Poland and Bulgaria. Here, in the face of the opportunity to use this great potential, complete passivity is to be seen. European solidarity requires that the Union support these projects as strategic for its future and as projects which guarantee the uniform development of all European states. It is a pity we are not talking, today, about great investments which will really solve our energy problems and unite and develop the European Union. While we are talking about important measures related to green energy, let us, however, remember that the idea that green energy will solve our energy problems is an illusion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I, too, would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has done on this subject. We are here to discuss a very specific programme to aid economic recovery, which is in the crucial area of energy in this case. In the current crisis situation that we are experiencing, proposals such as this one that help create jobs are essential. There is no chance of restructuring the economy if we do not make job creation our priority. This report sends a very positive message by drawing our attention to how to respond in this area at local level: how to respond specifically to local needs. We are in a period when we are debating, and will debate a great deal more, a series of legislative proposals in the field of energy, and we often tend to concentrate too much on the large-scale projects and networks, forgetting other causes in which intervention is absolutely essential.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I believe that this report could help us not only to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is very important, but also to provide concrete benefits for local communities, which naturally means concrete benefits for the European public as a whole. That is why, Madam President, I wish to conclude with two final points: it is important never to forget that energy efficiency is also achieved, to a large extent, by cutting energy use through microgeneration projects like those included in this report; and, finally, it was a great victory for this House to ensure that the amount of financing to be allocated to these projects would be specified. That was not what we were aiming for, because we needed much more. I would therefore ask the Commissioner what he is seeking to do and intends to do to guarantee these needs.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The submitted proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 is a response to the repeated requests of the European Parliament to create a new, single-purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables. The support for measures in the construction industry to increase the energy efficiency of buildings, which annually consume up to 40% of energy in the EU, shows the justification for, and good sense of, this initiative.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Funding to cover the activities of this financial instrument may be obtained by transferring unused resources from a number of programmes in which it is not objectively possible to use the allocated funding in time to the planned extent. An example of this would be the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which has a financial reserve of around EUR 150 million, as well as the multi-year GR programme for the climate sector, which was set up with a similar aim. I therefore think it would be very sensible to consider how we might best use the financial resources saved in order to extend the scope of the European Energy Programme for Recovery to include a new and, it would seem, necessary, single purpose financial instrument for supporting energy efficiency and initiatives in the area of renewables.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We can make it easier for public bodies at the local, municipal and regional levels to implement projects in the area of energy saving and renewables thanks to this effective new financial instrument.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, I am pleased that the European Union has learned to kill two birds with one stone. The first ‘bird’ is aid for business. At a time when the Member States are forced to cut spending and the banks are wary of giving loans, the European Union has come forward with a specific solution in the form of a new financial instrument. The second ‘bird’ is Europe’s heavy dependence on imported energy. The aim of this new instrument is to reduce energy consumption and increasing usage of our own energy sources, such as wind, sun, water and biomass, thereby reducing our overall dependence on imported energy. Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you all to support the creation of this new financial instrument to assist projects in the field of energy. It will help both our businesses in hard times and reduce our overall dependence on imported energy resources. Thank you for your attention.</p>

      <p sl="lt">First of all, I would like to congratulate my group colleague for her significant work negotiating this document and including it in the issues that are especially important for the energy market of the entire European Union. In the context of energy security, it is particularly important to promote energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy, and secure the required financing for such projects. The successful implementation of such projects would directly contribute to achieving the energy objectives set by the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="lt">This additional money will help local and regional public authorities improve financing for sustainable energy projects and implement innovative financial incentive schemes, such as guarantees and soft loans. Thus far, plans to promote energy efficiency, such as building renovation, which has already been discussed, have not been fully implemented. Therefore, I believe that this additional financing will become a good incentive to step up sustainable energy initiatives and projects, especially at regional and local level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we are talking, at the moment, about something which is absolutely fundamental, not only when we are dealing with economic matters, but also when we are dealing in broader terms with the question of European solidarity. This is because energy is, in fact, the greatest challenge and the greatest test. Can that European solidarity work in practice or will it merely be a slogan or a catchword? Or again – and this is certainly something expected by European taxpayers and voters – will it be put into practice in specific projects which will build European unity and which will show that in Europe, the different countries help each other, work on projects together and do not accept situations in which certain states from outside the European Union make agreements with other states over the heads of the European Union? I think this should, at last, be said very clearly and directly.</p>

      <p sl="cs">It is, without doubt, thanks to this Parliament that the volume of resources for projects in the area of energy efficiency and renewables has reached EUR 146 million. If it was up to the Member States, this figure would be substantially lower. Unfortunately, however, the legal form and structure of the fund remain uncertain, as does the question of what financial projects it will provide. In the interests of transparency, potential applicants should know who will decide on applications and how the selection committees will be appointed.</p>
      <p sl="cs">If we are to dispel the suspicion that the newly established fund is targeted mainly at those who have not used the resources allocated within the EUR 5 billion package of the economic recovery programme due to non-implementation of projects, representatives of the new Member States should also be included in the selection process. The fund may be primarily intended for local and regional authorities, but we should also consider whether it would not be appropriate to allow private entities to apply as well, and not just where they are acting on behalf of public bodies. Increasing energy efficiency and the share of renewables should be a shared responsibility of both the public and the private sector, and European funding should therefore be available to both sectors. I see great opportunities in the combined production of heat and electricity, and in clean urban transport.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not easy to find so much unanimity in Parliament This means that the work was really outstanding and Mrs Van Brempt and all the other shadow rapporteurs should be made aware of this.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has been said that the resulting instrument is very positive for several reasons. It is positive because its procedures and timeframes are fast; positive because it is aimed at highly qualified project categories; positive because it is aimed at urban contexts, in other words, at local authorities which, by making specific decisions, are able to bring about real change in the state of affairs and improve air quality, housing quality and urban transport quality; positive because it is aimed at profitable projects and can therefore yield a return of resources; and positive, lastly, because the strategy will bring many more resources into play.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the face of all this, however, picking up on an objection raised by many Members, including Mr Geier, Mr Turmes and Mr Cancian, I wish to say to the Commissioner that the sticking point will be the implementation, the choice of financial intermediaries, the relationship with local authorities and how their financial difficulties are dealt with. Commissioner, this instrument raises the possibility of opening the way to other projects, to a stabilisation of this instrument and its extension to other sectors. The topic is crucial. The same thing must not happen that happened with the Recovery Plan and with the small and medium-sized enterprises that are still waiting for the EUR 30 billion approved by Parliament and the Commission at the end of 2008.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I, too, wish to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur on her very efficient work on such an important report. The report provides an important instrument for financing and implementing projects in the energy sector that will aid economic recovery at difficult times and help to complete the internal energy market and attain the climate and energy targets set by the European Union for 2020.</p>
      <p sl="el">The creation of a fund to support energy efficiency and renewable initiatives is especially important, even with a small initial endowment of EUR 146 million. I am delighted that the European Parliament has stood by its commitment to promote renewable energy sources and energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to comment on the need for a balanced geographical distribution of future programmes, so that they can benefit all the Member States. Greece received just 1.5% of the programme for natural gas pipelines. I trust that we shall have a fairer distribution in future.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, it is such a massive achievement that Parliament’s rapporteur and the Commissioner have jointly managed to make the Council retain this money in the funds available. This is a very important and highly significant event from our point of view. We hope that later on, we will be able to extend this to other budget chapters as well. It is just as important that we managed to spend this money on the original purpose it was earmarked for and, above all, through small and medium-sized enterprises and local authorities, on projects affecting the public.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This is a truly important step forward. It is rare for the European institutional system to reach the public or small and medium-sized enterprises directly. This is why it is very important that we complete these projects successfully by 2014 and it would be of similar importance to examine efficiency in 2014 in order to improve the efficiency of this institutional system as well. I congratulate the rapporteur and wish for every success in spending the money.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, funding has been available, which should have been invested in the energy sector, among other areas. We have discussed this in great detail in the committee and we were not sure whether all the money could be spent. At that time, the Commissioner promised us that he would guarantee that none of the money would be left over or returned to where it came from. The most important thing for me is that the Commissioner has kept his word. He submitted a document to us fairly quickly which allowed us to ensure that the funding that otherwise would have been lost could be used for the energy sector. This was the first step.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second step was that Mrs Van Brempt managed to guide the members of the committee towards a solution and a compromise. She deserves our thanks for this. This was not easy, because it is simpler just to push through your own view, rather than finding a solution. This ultimately ensured, since we were also under time pressure, that the funding could be made available and could be used.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last but not least, we finally succeeded, with the help of the Council, and we must admit this in all honesty, in finding a compromise that allowed us to secure all the funding for the energy sector down almost to the last euro within the specified time and, as a result, to make sure that the funding was not lost. That was the most important thing for me and the most productive outcome and, therefore, I would like to thank everyone involved.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I wish to remind you that in 2009, when the European Union’s economic recovery plan was debated for the first time, the Commission made the undertaking that it would allocate EUR 1 billion to energy efficiency in homes. Unfortunately, this action has not been taken at the right time. Indeed, the ‘smart cities’ initiative has only had a small amount of money allocated to it due to the fact that, ultimately, if any funds remain unused, the Commission must allocate this money to the ‘smart cities’ initiative, which is happening via this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I tabled an amendment calling for the level of management expenses and costs linked to creating and implementing the instrument not to exceed 5% of the value of each use so that the largest share of the money does not end up with financial intermediaries, but goes into investments for projects linked to energy efficiency in homes and the use of renewable energy resources.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also called for greater transparency and for the site www.buildup.eu to be used, not to mention for the applied model, whenever this instrument is used, to be made available free of charge to anyone who is interested so that we can benefit from best practices.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Energy 2020 strategy launched yesterday by the European Commission marks an important step towards a secure, competitive energy market in Europe. It offers solutions to major issues such as how to diversify supply routes and sources, reduce energy consumption or coordinate operations with third countries. However, there are obvious shortcomings in terms of funding. The main aim of the European Energy Programme for Recovery is precisely to facilitate the funding of investments in this area. Its efficient implementation requires compliance with all environmental legislation and project promoters must keep to their funding commitments. In my view, active cooperation between national, regional and local authorities would facilitate the issuing of the required permits.</p>

By this means, we can provide a more sustainable future economically, socially and environmentally speaking. We must seize this opportunity to move towards a low carbon economy and facilitate the change for those who wish to change. Decentralisation is very important for sustainable energy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Assistance for energy infrastructure projects from money earmarked to stimulate the European Union economy was debated and allocated a year ago. At that time, the money was intended for just two types of projects, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, i.e. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and wind farms in the North Sea.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As far as this assistance and assistance for renewable energy in general is concerned, we generally cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach for the whole European Union. We must take into account the situation of each Member State, in particular, as regards energy independence. I therefore welcome the European Commission’s proposal to review the procedures for the allocation of money according to the programme mentioned, taking into account the promotion of energy efficiency.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, I feel that we should not talk about this purely in the context of the financial crisis, because even once a normal economic cycle has been restored, the issue of energy efficiency will remain. The Member States should have the opportunity to react with more flexibility to changing circumstances and thus promote energy efficiency, energy diversification and an increase in energy independence.</p>

Credit lines that are able to complement worthy local initiatives are needed. Our preference must be for the financing of projects that also guarantee technological innovation to raise the competitiveness of industry.

      <p sl="pl">In January 2009, in response to the financial crisis, the European Commission proposed the reallocation of EUR 5 billion from unspent European Union funds, mostly to support energy projects which would contribute to economic recovery in the European Union. The European Energy Programme for Recovery, which is now being proposed, should be welcomed. Priority issues in this project are, in my opinion, support for cross-border gas and electricity infrastructure projects, including inter-connectors, and also support for Carbon Capture and Storage projects. I also consider it necessary to insist that the draft resolution also include projects in the area of electrical efficiency and renewable energy sources, which stimulate economic development by creating opportunities for additional jobs and help in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Investments made in projects of this kind are most efficient when they are undertaken on site at district, regional and local level. Local projects involve a large amount of work, and this contributes to the creation of large numbers of new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with this EUR 146 million, we are entering an experimental laboratory together. Firstly, I would like to say thank you, because you have fought to ensure that it was not EUR 114 million, but EUR 146 million, and that the Member States were prepared to go slightly beyond their rather restrictive limit.</p>
      <p sl="de">As far as the experimental laboratory is concerned, we have four interesting questions to resolve. The first question is how we can achieve success in the field of energy efficiency. I believe that, of the three requirements relating to CO2 , renewable energy and energy efficiency, the 20% increase in energy efficiency presents us with the most difficult and complex challenge. This is not just about mandatory national requirements, but about specific projects. Basically, we are using this manageable programme to evaluate which projects, such as building renovation projects and those relating to the field of energy in general, will be feasible. I hope that in two or three years, the first assessment of these projects for the next budget period will show that we have had some useful positive and negative experiences with regard to energy efficiency. I would like to make it clear that in two to three years, we will definitely be more knowledgeable than we are today and that we will have had some good experiences and made some mistakes. If this is the case, we will have invested the money wisely.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, this programme allows the European Union to enter into a direct partnership with the municipalities. This is something which does not happen every day. It is clear that the energy requirements and consumption in public buildings and in private buildings that can be renovated, in other words, a smart city approach, can only be influenced by the EU via the municipalities. This means having direct contact with what is actually happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I hope that we will be able to demonstrate with this programme that there is European added value for everyone. If we were only to obtain money from the Member States without providing any added value, we would be unnecessary. We must offer added value in the form of experience, effectiveness and competence. In this case, within two years, this programme will give us good arguments that we can use in the budget debates – a poker game involving the Commission, Parliament and the Member States – to obtain more money from the Member States in the interests of all the citizens of the European Union. This means that this is also an experimental laboratory for more budget funding. This controversial issue will affect every one of us over the next two years.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, we need an experimental laboratory for our partnership with the structural banks – the European Investment Bank (EIB) and KfW Bankengruppe – and with external private investors and funds. This means a partnership that goes beyond the Commission’s offices with companies which have a close relationship with us, but which must demonstrate that they can do more than just manage public money.</p>
      <p sl="de">This may seem like a large amount of funding, but in fact, it is very little. This is not about the EUR 146 million. It is about a four-way test of our partnership with the municipalities, with the EIB and KfW, with the subject of energy efficiency at a local level, and with the proof that at a European level, this is the right area for more budget funding.</p>
      <p sl="de">With this in mind, I would like to thank you very much. Let us stay in contact. I am sure that in two years, we will all know much more than we do now.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, as a Belgian Member of this House, it was a real pleasure for me to come here to work on a public holiday. As a result, I was able to reach the European Parliament from my home town in just 50 minutes, but that is entirely by the by.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As rapporteur, I will be brief. Let me thank everyone, without exception, who has contributed to the debate today. We have heard some comments and very many good examples have been given. However, the connecting thread here is the enthusiasm over what we have achieved. Not without criticism, because I could very easily criticise the cap on money that has been set.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is a great deal of enthusiasm because this a good fund, because the money is available, because this is about energy efficiency and renewable energy and because this gives us, as Members of the European Parliament, the opportunity to take local action, too, through this project. That is what is needed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What is our common responsibility? In the first instance, of course, responsibility lies with the Commission, the European Investment Bank and other partners in this story. However, Parliament and us politicians are also responsible for ensuring that this project becomes a success, that it has a canvassing effect, and that involvement at local level becomes so large that the EUR 146 million multiplies not by eight but by 80, so to speak, because we have set many things in motion. In that regard, I have a lot of confidence in the Commission and the Commissioner. I know that this is a project which is close to the Commissioner’s heart. He also has very good staff – as I have seen for myself over the past few months – and that will be very important for the outcome of this project.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude – I forgot to say it earlier, which is really remiss of me, particularly as a Belgian – I would make the point that the Belgian Presidency has given an exceptional account of itself here. To begin with, from the outset, a large majority in the Council was actually against this project. It is thanks to the major efforts of Minister Paul Magnette and his team that we now have a very good compromise and one that we will soon, I think, also adopt with a great deal of enthusiasm.</p>

      <p sl="it">In January 2009, the European Commission proposed reallocating a portion of unused European finance to support projects in the energy sector in response to the economic and financial crisis. Our discussion today on the report amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 is of particular importance: the proposal to use otherwise unused financial resources to support sector projects represents an opportunity in these times of difficult access to funding. In my opinion, the European Energy Programme for Recovery, which aims to finance initiatives and projects in the sector of energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies, supporting the investment of European public authorities, in particular, in urban settings, can give a tangible stimulus to the recovery of the European economy and the creation of job opportunities for young people. I am encouraged by measures on energy efficiency in the building sector, which uses 40% of EU energy, and that would represent a support to small and medium-sized enterprises at local and regional level. This assistance would also favour the development of promising initiatives in the energy efficiency sector at the level of local authorities which, due to the recent crisis, have suffered a drastic reduction in revenue.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ladies and gentlemen, last year I, too, welcomed the allocation of almost EUR 4 billion for projects in the field of energy as part of the Union’s economic stimulus package. I also pointed out that the aid package neglected the Central and Eastern European region, which is most threatened from the aspect of energy security, and that energy efficiency projects did not benefit from the aid either. However, it would have been precisely through energy efficiency projects that the main objective of the package, namely rapid and effective job creation, could have been achieved. I am pleased that the new proposal allocates as yet unused funds to this very field. Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are not only among the main means of achieving the 20/20/20 targets, but also increase supply security and competitiveness. These projects bring impressive results in the short term as well. They create new jobs in a geographically diverse manner and effectively dynamise economic actors. Spending the EUR 146 million fund on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects is a good start but we must admit that this amount is insignificant even at Member State level. We are very pleased that the Energy 2020 strategy unveiled by the Commission yesterday sets out the creation of an energy-efficient Europe as one of its main priorities. We trust that the strategic commitment to energy efficiency will also be reflected in the distribution of other funds.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Energy Programme for Recovery provides a financial package amounting to EUR 3.98 billion for 2009 and 2010. It was absolutely imperative to create a financial instrument specially intended for using the funds in this energy programme, which could not be committed until the end of 2010, so as not to lose the remainder of the financial package. One particularly important aspect mentioned in the European Energy Programme Regulation is the geographical balance of the projects. This is a key element enabling the impact of this regulation on the economic recovery to be guaranteed across the whole of the European Union. It also acknowledges that there were projects in some Member States which were either not financed at all or only partially financed. Last but not least, I want to emphasise how important it is to renew these types of financial instruments aimed at promoting long-term energy efficiency in the EU. I call on the Commission to assess carefully the effectiveness of renewing these types of instruments and to examine the potential of using a similar approach in the future when dealing with other unspent funds from the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The opportunity to direct funds not spent according to the directive towards the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects was already set out in the regulation, but I welcome the fact that it was possible to find consensus as regards its specific implementation. Energy efficiency and renewable energy have frequently been named as EU priorities helping to implement the 2020 strategy and ensure energy security. Investments in this sector during the economic downturn are very important, as they will create a possibility for new jobs and will promote competitiveness, the spread of innovations and economic stability. Furthermore, the financial instrument planned – like the setting-up of a fund for European financial institutions – will increase the amount available several times over, thus increasing opportunities to finance projects. It is only regrettable that the financial instrument planned is not continuous, but hopefully it will establish a suitable incentive for further energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, thank you very much for being here and for having shown so much sensitivity regarding this very important parliamentary initiative that is so necessary for the European livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole, due to multiple factors: the high costs of inputs, the fall in market prices, imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European livestock industry has to deal with these problems just like other agricultural sectors, but with an aggravating factor: the large investments that are particular to this type of production.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the European Commission is on the verge of presenting its communication on the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I think this is a very good time to send a message of solidarity and concern to this group of producers. In my country, Spain, as in other EU countries, we are talking about a structural crisis, and the cereal price rises have just aggravated a situation that has been dragging on for several years now.</p>
      <p sl="es">The statistics show that a growing number of farms are being abandoned. However, this should not be the case in the context of global demand that will grow in the next few years thanks to the supposed improvement in people’s standard of living.</p>
      <p sl="es">With a view to the forthcoming CAP reform, what measures is the Commissioner, or the European Commission, planning, taking into account the specific nature of the livestock sector? I am talking about market measures, and other initiatives to prevent the models of intensive production that respect EU environmental standards being penalised by the future aid system, among other detrimental effects. Common-sense measures should be implemented that guarantee greater security of supply of livestock feed, the establishment of sufficient cereal reserves and the speeding up of the release of those reserves.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, to conclude, I would like to welcome the fact that this motion for a resolution makes special mention of pork and poultry, sectors that do not receive direct EU aid, but for which market and trade measures could also be established to alleviate their situation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, I welcome the fact that this issue is being discussed here today. I think it is very timely. At present, the EU livestock sector is experiencing difficulties caused by a range of factors, including rising production costs, competition from imports from third countries, and, of course, various issues which contribute to the rising cost of feed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although we have no control over droughts in Australia or severe weather conditions that affect the grain harvest in Russia, I do believe that Europe urgently needs to tackle its lack of self-sufficiency regarding protein crops. We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves. However, the situation at present is that we are forced to import a lot of our feed and I have said many times before that I strongly believe that the process of approving new types of GMO grain for import is taking far too long, and feedstuff from soya urgently requires to be speeded up. If this does not happen, livestock producers across the European Union will have to cope with rising prices, volatility and uncertainty for a long time to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">May I also briefly mention how the situation is affecting the pig and poultry industry. Farmers in this sector are feeling the crisis quite acutely, as their costs are rising and the price of pigmeat is falling. I would like to ask the Commission to monitor the situation closely and utilise all the tools that it has at its disposal to rectify matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">Beef producers, sheep producers, pig producers, poultry producers are all in a situation where they are making a loss. Need I go on telling the House that all these areas are actually suffering? But I have to say that ultimately, it will be the consumer who will pay because, if all the farmers stop producing, you are going to have to import this food from abroad, with all the problems this entails. So we have got to have security of our own food supply within Europe. If we do not do that, it will be at our own peril.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, the profitability of livestock production is directly linked to feed costs. In the growing context of volatile raw materials prices, decision making is becoming very complex for feed manufacturers and livestock breeders, as we saw at the start of the political year.</p>
      <p sl="es">The meat sector that is having the most difficult time is currently the pork sector. Therefore, I will focus my speech on the serious problems it is facing: the increase in the cost of animal feed, which represents 60% of production costs, and is therefore crucially important in terms of profitability for producers.</p>
      <p sl="es">In two months, cereal prices have risen by 50%, not due to an imbalance between supply and demand, as there is sufficient production, but due to speculation from outside the sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">Action must therefore be taken against speculation, along with a policy encouraging the holding of sufficient strategic stock to avoid speculation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We welcome the fact that grain intervention stocks are being put on the market. We just have to hope that their final destination will be the EU market, otherwise they will not help the livestock sector. A tax on exporting European cereal, as in the case of wheat in 1994, would be a possible solution.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another problem is the pressure of mass distribution with falling prices, which means that increases in production costs cannot be regained from the sale price.</p>
      <p sl="es">Producers’ organisations need to be promoted that are capable of positioning themselves in the market, concentrating supply. The Commission is very much aware of the problem, but there is a lack of specific measures, which we hope will materialise in the future common agricultural policy, through efficient and flexible market management mechanisms to combat and act against the problems. This means combating speculation and using specific measures to promote the competitiveness of the sector in the market and increase its weight in the value chain.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for the activation of the market measures applicable to pork, export refunds and private storage. The Commission does not think that the situation in the sector justifies this. However, in recent months, there has been a continuous decline in prices, and the prices received by breeders are below the average for the last five years.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe it is justifiable for the Commission to trigger the existing market management measures, as some Member States have requested in the Council.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-087" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, my answer will be in two parts, because the problem in the livestock sector relates primarily to the food situation and, hence, to the situation in the cereals market, and then I will also refer to the mechanisms at our disposal for the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is following the situation in the cereals markets and its repercussions for farmers very closely. Cereal prices increased sharply over the summer due to supply shortages, particularly in the Black Sea countries. Thus, we have seen the price of barley and oats rise to as much as EUR 200 per tonne. At present, even though prices are very volatile, they are still well below the record prices of 2008. The strength of the euro against the dollar, which makes EU exports less competitive right now, is also a disruptive factor in the European market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Globally, despite the shortage recorded in Russia and Ukraine, the level of cereals harvested is normal, and stocks have been replenished thanks to the last two record harvests. In the European Union, average cereal production is estimated at 276 million tonnes, and if we add to that the stock from the start of the harvest, we have almost 60 million tonnes more than we are expected to use.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The grain intervention stocks, which mainly consist of barley, currently stand at 5.6 million tonnes. A 2.8 million tonne batch has just been set aside for the implementation of the 2011 programme to help the poorest citizens, and the rest will be sold on the internal market shortly. The decision has, in fact, already been taken, and the cereals will be placed on the market at the end of this month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The pressure on the market has eased somewhat since the Commission announced this measure, which I recently announced to the Council. With regard to the situation in the cereals market, then, no emergency measure can be justified because, as I explained to you, the problem is not one of supplying the European market with cereals, since the high price of cereals on the European market is not due to a lack of market supply.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is paying very close attention to market developments in the livestock sector, and more particularly in the pigmeat and poultry production sectors. The margins in this sector are, in fact, highly dependent on the costs of foodstuffs. Prices in the poultry sector are above the long-term average and appear to be at least partially offsetting the increased food costs. The price of slaughter pig is following the seasonal downwards trend. It is very slightly below last year’s level. Production is currently well absorbed by the internal market and exports. Between June and August 2010, pigmeat exports were up by 10% and poultry exports by 21% compared with the same period last year. Consequently, despite these price issues, pigmeat and poultry producers have still been able to export for some time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will obviously continue to monitor developments in the market and will use the means at its disposal to intervene in the market if this proves necessary and useful. Indeed, two measures are currently available for the livestock sector: export refunds and private storage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to export refunds, this measure would not be effective at present because the world price is rather high; therefore, an export subsidy cannot be justified. The relationship between the dollar and the euro means that export problems and a lack of competitiveness are possible, but this problem is not exclusive to the agricultural sector. We shall see how the rate between the dollar and the euro changes, and depending on that change, if we have surpluses in the internal market, we can then discuss private storage measures. For the moment, there are no meat surpluses in the internal market, and that is why private storage measures cannot be justified at present. However, I am willing to consider the possibility of resorting to these measures depending on how the markets evolve.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the issue of volatility, this will be addressed in the common agricultural policy reform for 2013. It is envisaged that this reform will include proposals for as yet non-existent mechanisms to address the issue of income volatility. As for the issue of transparency in the food chain, I am currently examining it with Commissioner Tajani to see how more information in this area could help clarify the way in which added value is shared out. Those are the answers I am able to give at this stage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, today’s motion for a resolution will help to set the European livestock sector on the right course. I would like to thank Mrs García for this initiative. The objective of the motion is not to cut Europe off from the rest of the world or to override the rules of the market. Its aim is to put in place fair market conditions for the European livestock industry, which will help to ensure food security for more than 500 million people in future. We must ensure that the European agricultural sector is not confronted with new and highly detailed production regulations on a daily basis and that farmers are not required to provide one certificate of competence after another, while maintaining high animal welfare and environmental standards. Rules of this kind apparently do not apply to imported agricultural products.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I am grateful to all the 534 Members of this House who voted in Strasbourg in favour of requiring agricultural imports to comply with European consumer protection, animal welfare and environmental protection standards in future. Mr Cioloş, Parliament is ready to give you its full support. These standards must be applied to imports and this is why my group welcomes and supports this motion.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here today to call on the Commission to implement suitable efficient and flexible market instruments to combat the crisis into which the European livestock sector has plunged.</p>
      <p sl="it">We hope that the proposal that the Commission will shortly present on market instruments for the milk and dairy sector will also include proposals to limit the impact of price volatility on the agricultural sector as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="it">Many actions can still be deployed to send out a strong signal to European livestock breeders. We believe, for example, that it would be very useful to the livestock sector to review the current ban on the use of animal meal for non-ruminants, for example, for the avian and fisheries sectors. As you know, this ban was introduced following cases of BSE but now, a few years on, the scientific community agrees in stating that the ban can only be justified for ruminants. In the case of non-ruminants, conversely, there is no danger to human health and the environment and we therefore hope that this ban may be overturned with the aim of offering these animals a greater possibility of higher-energy diets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the livestock sector is an important traditional farming industry which represents the livelihood of thousands of producers across the EU. This sector is central to the socio-economic contribution made by agriculture to the rural areas of the European Union. It is a key agri-industry in Europe and even more so in Ireland, as Ireland is the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world.</p>
      <p sl="de">In particular, the high cereal prices exacerbate the problems for profitability amongst winter beef finishers, who have a higher dependency on cereal-based feed imports. There are three issues in particular that I wish to highlight: firstly, the necessity that the Commission put in place efficient and flexible markers and measures to curb extreme market price volatility. Action is also needed to close the gap between prices paid by consumers and prices received by producers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, it is essential that the Commission steps up measures to support the livestock sector in less-favoured areas, in particular. The next CAP reform must focus on the special vulnerability of certain livestock sectors and the significant production costs that farmers undertake. Under the next CAP, the excessive bureaucratic burden on livestock farmers must be addressed and reduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">Lastly, European producers comply with the most stringent regulations in the world in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, and animal health and welfare. These high standards must not put them at a disadvantage in comparison to third country competitors. It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers, but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, just as in 2007, world cereal prices are soaring, and farmers are seeing a sharp rise in their production costs as they did two years ago. Cattle feed accounts for 60-80% of their costs, and their revenues are plummeting: they survive on an average of EUR 700 per month. Must we wait for successive crises to destroy Europe’s small-scale agriculture before we act? Consumers pay EUR 17 per kilo of rib steak in the supermarkets, while producers receive EUR 3 per kilo – is that right?</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 7 September, Parliament gave its verdict by voting for the report on fair revenues for farmers. It urged the Commission to act swiftly and prohibit selling below purchase price. The MEPs took a stand, in Strasbourg, so as to strengthen producers’ organisations, to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Farmers expect even more: they want to see common market organisations established or strengthened, since they are the only means of stabilising costs and providing long-term economic visibility. Next week, Commissioner Cioloş will present his proposal to reform the common agricultural policy; he will have to give some clear answers to farmers. Europe’s credibility is at stake. Europe needs every single one of its farmers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Standards of animal welfare should be obligatory and should be improved. I am emphatically in favour of ensuring that livestock have the best living conditions possible. However, the welfare of animals involves costs, and those costs are borne by the farmers, and there is a problem with unfair competition where meat products are imported into Europe from markets and third countries where no standards of animal welfare are maintained at all. This has to change. We should introduce these standards here, but we should also resolutely demand high standards – the same as we have in the Union – from all those who export their meat and livestock products to the European market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Make the decision to stop these excessive imports and stop the negotiations on that dreadful agreement to import 400 000 tonnes of beef from the Mercosur countries, as it would destroy entire regions.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, cereal price volatility is having severe repercussions on all livestock sectors but also on consumers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Cereal exporting is blocked due to the effect of the heat, fires, drought and floods – as is happening now in Italy. To aggravate the situation, Canada has reduced production following heavy rainfall this summer. Prices have been influenced not only by climate change but also by speculation on international markets. Cereal producers who are awaiting a price increase wait before selling their produce and put it in store, with the result that these agricultural products deteriorate. Speculation and severe climate change have led to a great increase in the prices of cereals used as animal feed and a knock-on increase in meat prices.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe it is essential for the Commission to ensure timely, targeted action to deal with the volatility in agricultural-product prices through innovative market interventions under the new CAP. The Commission must prevent speculative practices in agriculture to preserve the businesses of farmers and stock breeders and guarantee consumers genuine quality products at fair prices.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would urge the House to support this extremely important motion before us this morning. It is apparent to those of us who are from rural constituencies, and those who sit on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that the current position that many livestock farmers find themselves in is simply unsustainable.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not an attempt to cry wolf, but if we do not rectify the problems identified within the motion, we will, as a consequence, face higher food prices and be more reliant on third country imports. Countries like China and the United States are all increasingly aware of the importance of food supply security and, as a result, are continuing to increase the support which they provide to agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Northern Ireland, the beef price is well below the cost of production. As long as the cost of inputs keeps rising, and extra-regulatory requirements continue to increase, then many farmers will exit the industry, resulting in land abandonment, lack of economic activity in rural areas and a reduction in food production across the EU. It is high time we recognised the importance of food security and the value of the work carried out by farmers across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the current trade talks with the Mercosur bloc are having a destabilising effect within the industry. Coupled with difficult market conditionings and increasing costs, the livestock sector has been burdened with the further uncertainty created by reopening of the talks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is carrying on the negotiations and, regardless of the utterances of the Trade Commissioner, producers in Northern Ireland so far believe that the results can only be negative for European farmers and the quality of food being provided to the citizens of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that we need to say right from the start that it is consumers who are the main victims of the crisis we are debating today, and not farmers. It is a known fact that in farming, cereal prices affect approximately 80% of the price of animal feed. This, in turn, affects roughly 70% of production costs. It is impossible to increase proportionally the sale price of meat to the producer. Livestock farmers have no contact with the end consumer, but deal with the processors who always have the option to import. At the same time, processors pass on their large profit margin which they have been accustomed to hitherto in the sale price. Unfortunately, this period is coinciding with a general economic crisis and the decline in the population’s purchasing power is also affecting livestock production.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is another factor to consider. At a time when farmers will find it difficult to provide feed for their animals during winter, a huge number of them will choose to slaughter their animals, which will help prolong the crisis for more years in the future. In order to maintain domestic prices at a reasonable level and ensure animals receive the feed they require, intervention stocks need to be released. I am therefore pleased by the announcement made by Commissioner Cioloş today. I share the view of my fellow Members who stressed the importance of growing new genetically modified organisms to provide cheap feed for animals and reduce the dependency on imports.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, today’s debate is closely linked to the future of the common agricultural policy. We need a strong common agricultural policy which is well financed and well managed, and which can accommodate both structural development and modernisation measures, as well as market and direct support measures.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to this situation. It is therefore necessary to act immediately using the available mechanisms, and on this issue, I welcome the Commission’s decision to release 2.8 million tonnes of cereals, a measure that is positive but manifestly insufficient. New instruments must be found in the short and medium terms, for combating speculation in particular; in fact, the Commissioner has just said that that is the crux of the problem. Long-term solutions will need to be found in the context of the debate that we are about to begin on the new common agricultural policy.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, there is no question that the crisis must be resolved. However, this motion proposes solutions which we cannot support. Making the import of GM soya easier will not help to resolve the crisis in the livestock sector. On the contrary, we must begin to redevelop our own source of plant protein in Europe. Around 75% of our plant protein is imported. This is not acceptable and we need to introduce urgent changes.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also do not understand why many people are questioning the compromise which has been negotiated by all the groups and why they want to open the door to GM soya imports. That is not a solution. We also need to discuss what type of livestock farming we want in Europe. Once again, the small farms have been hit hardest by the crisis. On the other hand, industrial-scale livestock farming is developing in Europe which is not livestock friendly and which is not fair in agricultural terms. We ultimately need to do something in this area as well.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point is that I am very surprised that EUR 450 million from the agriculture budget is being transferred to the ITER nuclear fusion project. I would like Mr Cioloş to explain what we should think about this.</p>

The British livestock sector is struggling with high feed costs at present, and this is not helped by impediments which are placed in our way by the Commission.

      <p sl="hu">There are many reasons for the crisis in the livestock sector. Those who say that one reason is the unfair competition caused by imports and mention the dangers of the Mercosur negotiations are right. I wish to raise the issue of the surge in grain prices. It was foreseeable that grain prices would rise, and I have said this several times here in the European Parliament too. The European Commission has done nothing to prevent this. One reason for this problem is the reduction in intervention, which was a serious mistake. We must wake up to the fact that global grain trade is concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer companies. Incidentally, the same thing is happening in many of the EU Member States. The European Union decided not to keep emergency stocks, a decision which will further increase speculation in the future.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The fluctuation of grain prices causes losses not only to grain producers but also to livestock breeders and consumers. In addition to this, the costs are also borne by European taxpayers. Remember that the European Union sold the 2004/2005 intervention stocks at an enormous profit. Grain prices were low in the past period. If the European Union had intervened then, a huge profit could now be realised from the sale of grains, which would also help livestock breeders. However, we have no such stocks, and this is not only bad for producers and consumers, but it also means that the European Union is deprived of the opportunity of providing aid to countries afflicted by famine, such as Pakistan.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Firstly, Commissioner Cioloş’s efforts for the European Union to establish, at last, an appropriate protective mechanism against the global volatility of food prices deserve full support. Secondly, the high grain and animal feed prices point to the emergence of a shortage of protein in the European Union, on which Mr Häusling will draft a report. Thirdly, the fact that the common agricultural policy system is distorted, it over-subsidises grain farmers, and supports neither pig nor poultry farmers or livestock farmers in general, is another factor contributing to the current livestock crisis. Fourthly, livestock keepers are at a disadvantage in the supply chain compared to processors and traders. Fifthly, livestock keepers are forced to make disproportionately large environmental protection investments. This is particularly serious in the new Member States. This, too, should be addressed and remedied.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs García very much for this initiative and I would also like to refer specifically to the situation of livestock farming in mountain areas. In many regions of the European Union, there are agricultural alternatives to livestock farming, but this is generally not the case in mountain regions. If there were to be no grazing stock in the mountains, then many of the agricultural areas there would simply be useless and would be abandoned. This would not only restrict the business opportunities in mountain regions, but would also change the landscape and eventually reduce biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The dairy sector plays a special role in this respect, because it creates jobs and generates income in mountain regions and in other areas. This is why I believe that we must focus specifically on three issues in the reform of agricultural policy. We need a common agricultural policy (CAP) which takes into account livestock farming in mountain regions and provides subsidies to livestock farmers there. Secondly, we need a flexible second pillar of the CAP which makes it possible to provide special support for livestock farms in mountain areas. Thirdly, we need a quality policy which focuses, in particular, on products from mountain regions and which provides options for special labelling, so that added value can be obtained on the market for these products from the livestock sector in mountain areas.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble. Prices on the international market have increased by more than 16% on average since June. Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market, nor has there been so much money involved. Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts, without any contact with the real economy. The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are impressive, and transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya, maize and wheat. The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices, even in a year when cereals are widely available. These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms, which will be unable to pass on the increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them. It is, therefore, time to take action and protect our food from financial speculation. I would like to know, then, what the Commission intends to do about this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what a funny old world the agricultural world is! A year ago, in this Chamber, we were all bemoaning the general production situation. Today, one production sector, the cereal sector, is doing better than the others – and I think we should, all the same, welcome that. However, its success is unfortunately having very serious repercussions for another sector, the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The real issue today is the agricultural industry’s inability to pass on the costs it has to incur to consumers. Therefore, as has already been said this morning, we need to help organise producers so that they can make their presence felt in their dealings with their customers and, in particular, in their dealings with the large-scale distribution sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the chain, the functioning of the markets is more pernicious. How can we explain the fact that, for years, decades, we said that South American countries were placing a strain on production and bringing prices down? How can we explain that, although prices are today increasing again in those countries, we cannot pass on that increase to our producers because, yes, there has been an increase in costs, but – and this must also be said – there has been no increase in producer prices?</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can we fail to mention the cost differentials that exist between our countries? Admittedly, this is partly a question of national responsibilities. However, the dumping that goes on today between our various countries helps destabilise markets, and I believe that Europe should tackle this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, solutions must be found. European cereal producers are aware, I think, of the situation faced by their main customers – farmers. They are prepared to enter into a contractual agreement. Are you prepared, Commissioner, to support that agreement?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, again we are here having a debate about farmers’ incomes being destroyed by markets that are, to be quite frank, slightly dysfunctional in make-up and also cannot cope with major shocks like the grain price hike we are seeing. Surely it is time our farming and market system was stronger and I hope the Commission and the Commissioner notice yet again that the political groups in this House are further calling for an adequate CAP budget post-2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">The costs of inputs and overbearing regulations are making EU farms uncompetitive and the viability of our farm sector is deteriorating. Our grassland system of quality and environmentally sustainable beef production is being undercut by third country imports. We must give our farmers a fair chance and, in my experience, that is all they want. The EU’s lack of self-sufficiency in grain is becoming a serious issue, not just for the beef but also for the pig and poultry industries. This motion is a statement of the seriousness with which this House takes ongoing developments in our agricultural markets. We as a Parliament must intervene when we feel the situation is urgent and, to be quite frank, Commissioner, our beef, poultry and pig sectors immediately need positive intervention. I look forward to your response.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Commissioner, the situation this year is teaching us that an appropriate level of cereal reserves is essential to ensure food security and market stability. This security should be guaranteed by appropriate decisions at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another very important matter is the search for new sources of protein – this is a very good route towards the independence of European agriculture. We must, therefore, promote the cultivation of protein-rich crops. Let us remember, however, that it is our unconditional obligation to guarantee farmers permanent access to feed. For this reason, I support the motion which calls on the European Commission to establish a minimum threshold for the level of unauthorised varieties of GMOs permissible in imports of soya. Continuation of the policy of zero tolerance constitutes a threat to the entire food production chain.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, there are currently two threats to global livestock farming and food. On the one hand, we have the seed monopolies, and we have seen the disastrous consequences of modified seed in this sector in India. On the other hand, we have the games played by financial organisations with the prices of basic products.</p>
      <p sl="el">In 2008, we had the biggest global production of cereals. In 2008, and here lies the absurdity, unless it is explained by financial games, we had the biggest food crisis, a food crisis that caused social disruption and the loss of many human lives. We need to monitor these two issues. We need to increase local resources, ensure that farmers have free access to seed and that livestock farmers also pay lower prices, and regulate the operation of financial organisations.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, livestock farms are suffering the consequences of the crisis. Moreover, they have to comply with the strictest standards in the world, increasing their production prices, with the disadvantage that this gives them in comparison with third countries. I therefore think that the common agricultural policy firstly needs to guarantee sufficient funding after 2013 in order to ensure the viability of agricultural producers and breeders. Secondly, it needs to adopt specific measures for breeders that use sustainable protection measures. Thirdly, it needs to strengthen the measures to support the livestock sector in the most disadvantaged areas. Fourthly, it needs to stipulate that imports from third countries meet EU standards in order to prevent unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I ask the Commission to defend the interests of European producers in all trade negotiations, in order not to endanger the production of the livestock sector. Failing to adopt these measures could mean that Europe becomes a region without a sector that is dependent on imports and third countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the crisis in the EU’s livestock sector has hit farmers hard in Scotland and there are many things we could do to help. Firstly, we could reduce the regulatory burden. It is madness that we apply more stringent red tape and regulation to our own EU producers than we apply to our competitors outside the EU. Our farmers are bound hand and foot by red tape, and yet we import vast quantities of foodstuffs produced under welfare and hygiene conditions that would constitute a criminal offence in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The high cost of complying with all of this red tape is not reflected in the prices our beef farmers are getting for their cattle. British beef is now being sold well below the cost of production; lowland suckler-cow producers reckon they are losing around GBP 260 per cow; our dairy farmers have suffered a long spiral of decline. We have to stop the rot.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The increase in cereal prices is another factor that is adding to and exacerbating the crisis in the livestock sector. The current common agricultural policy and the European Union’s trade policies do not ensure a fair income for farmers, particularly small and medium-sized producers, nor do they prevent the effects of the increasing costs of the factors of production and the volatility of agricultural product prices: they worsen them instead. This volatility has causes that are not only, or even mostly, natural: amongst these is speculation on foodstuffs. Any measures that are taken in this area will always be limited in scope if they do not include banning the instruments that make it profitable, specifically derivatives. Safeguarding production, the right to produce, and food sovereignty and security require an end to the subjugation of agriculture and food production to the market and competitiveness. It requires effective measures for regulating and intervening in the markets, without which price volatility will get worse and concentration processes will occur, only to be survived by a small number of large producers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I am very pleased to see the interest shown, including in the European Parliament, in a sector that is essential not only for market supply, but also for the stability of our regions: I am talking about the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The answers to many of the issues and problems raised will no doubt be found in the proposals that the Commission will shortly be presenting on the future of the common agricultural policy. Parliament will also be able to discuss these proposals as early as next week. We will doubtless also address in them the issue of the fair distribution of aid among the various sectors, including the livestock sector. We will also address the issues of support for the livestock sector in more specific and more difficult areas and of mechanisms for managing income volatility. However, some specific questions have been asked which I should like to answer. The first one concerns the problem of cereal prices and intervention stocks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that we no longer have the intervention stocks we had in the past, but this is because prices are higher now. Market intervention cannot be justified when prices are high. I believe that we must consider other kinds of mechanisms and, although stocks can play a part, we shall have to consider types of stock other than the intervention stock on the market that we had in the past. This issue should perhaps be dealt with at an even broader level than the European level alone, given that the market is now more open than in the past.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On ITER, Mr Häusling: just because part of the 2010 budget has not been used for agriculture and is going to ITER does not mean that we do not have the resources to intervene in the agricultural sector. I can assure you that these additional funds that are going to ITER have not been taken from any CAP mechanisms; this money is still available and has not been used, because there has been no need to use it. Even with this transfer, however, I can assure you that we have the budget we need to be able to apply the requisite measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude by saying that the issue of volatility – and the impact that speculation on the market has on volatility – is one that the Commission is addressing more extensively, for derived products and commodities alike. I am working with my colleague, Mr Barnier, on this issue. The Commission will present some proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the distribution of added value along the food chain, together with Commissioner Tajani, we will organise a first meeting of the High Level Group on this issue no later than next week.</p>

      <p sl="lv">These days, Europe’s livestock farmers are experiencing difficulties that we must all overcome together in order to enable the livestock sector to develop and generate enough revenue for farmers. In the last few months, there has been a significant increase in cereal prices, made more acute by extraordinary events, such as the floods in Pakistan and the forest fires in Russia, for example. Of course, we have no influence over these climatic disasters, but it is within our power to draw up legislative proposals that could help Europe’s farmers to overcome the consequences of these cataclysms. What is certain is that we can and must restrict speculation in cereals, which is also one of the causes of these difficulties. It is intolerable that such dishonest dealings cause losses for a sector that is one of the foundation stones of European agriculture. I should additionally like to remind you that it is essential for the Commission to defend the interests of European farmers in its discussions with the Mercosur nations on a new trade agreement and to ensure the conditions for fair competition. I call upon the Commission to begin working actively to help European farmers to overcome the existing difficulties in the livestock sector, as our support is vital for farmers.</p>

      <p sl="de">The livestock sector presents a number of problems for European farmers, including the rising cost of inputs, competition from third country imports, major fluctuations in feed costs and relatively low prices for meat. If we are to put in place a lasting policy for the livestock sector, we must take into consideration all the stakeholders, including farmers, consumers and the animals themselves. The objective must be to move away from industrial-scale livestock farming and towards more natural, respectful treatment of animals on small farms. All of this must be combined with the highest possible levels of safety for consumers in the form of comprehensive animal health services and clear labelling of all food products from animals, in particular, with regard to their origin and the way in which the animals are reared. The EU must put in place the basic conditions needed to safeguard the future of our farmers so that they can stay competitive internationally and their businesses can remain economically viable, despite the fact that we have the strictest animal welfare standards in the world.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The increase in cereal prices is also a threat to the livestock sector in the EU on account of its dependence on feed imported from third countries. The situation is critical in the area of pork production, where feed accounts for 60% of production costs, but rising costs may gradually threaten all branches of livestock production in the EU. Europe should therefore reduce its dependence on the import of feed from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="cs">It is surely no solution to switch to genetically modified feeds imported from the US. In the EU, it takes almost two and a half years to approve such feeds, in Argentina around three years, in Brazil three to five years, and China is also adopting strict measures in this area. In the US, on the other hand, approval takes only 15 months. The crisis in the EU livestock sector must not be exploited for the commercial ends of US companies, which see significant export potential in the European market.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The European Union should aim to reduce production costs, to ensure that third countries comply with EU standards, and to ensure that producers get a decent price for their products. It is not acceptable for consumers to bear the consequences of higher prices, for producers to receive ever less money and for distributors to make ever greater profits.</p>

However, we hope that we will see a different attitude adopted by the European Commission in future because it is not normal for European farmers to always lose out as a result of commercial agreements. The Commission also needs to be more involved in strengthening producer organisations in all livestock sectors, in order to enable them to negotiate better prices for their products, while taking into account production costs. At the same time, I call on the Commission to release as quickly as possible cereals from the intervention stocks to support this sector which has been hit hard by the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, alternative investment funds are of very great significance to the Union’s economy. The managers of these funds have to keep to legislation and standards which enable the provision of services in the territory of Member States, and supervision of financial markets has to be accurate and effective. To this end, we must eliminate every lack of precision in the legal and administrative systems responsible for these funds. The proposals which have been submitted improve the transparency and efficiency of systems of supervision, and the greater effectiveness of legislation will bear fruit in an improvement in the stability and credibility of financial institutions, and, as a result, an improvement in the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, today’s vote represents a significant step forward by the European Union in the regulation of alternative investment funds. Under the directive, fund managers must be registered and authorised and respect stringent codes of conduct within the European Union. This is, in fact, the first time that this sector has been regulated, and I believe that the paper we have voted on has paved the way to achieving – soon, I hope – a true single market in financial products.</p>
      <p sl="it">I should like to emphasise the important role of the European Parliament, which has insisted on strong rules for greater monitoring of the financial industry, which will therefore also become – I hope you do not mind my saying it – more ethical. The lessons of the recent past, of the financial crisis triggered by excessive speculation by investment funds, should lead us to welcome this directive, which offers greater guarantees of protection to the public.</p>
      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the compromise that was achieved and, finally, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, on his mammoth task.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when we looked at the initial proposal right at the beginning, 18 months ago, we saw what many would describe as a ‘wrinkly shirt’. This was clearly a proposal on which the industry had not been consulted – a proposal which would have shut markets, made it very difficult for European investors to invest in non-EU funds and led to a lower return for pension funds, affecting investment in developing countries. I was very concerned about those proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fortunately, after the work between the shadow rapporteurs and excellent cooperation, as well as the good work by the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency, we came to an acceptable solution that now works and which keeps markets open, increases transparency and ensures that European investors can continue to invest in markets outside the EU. We have to keep a watchful eye on the role of ESMA to make sure it does not block access to non-EU funds, but overall, we have come up with a compromise that is acceptable across the House.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this very important document. Now that the European Parliament’s decision on the abolition of visas for citizens of the Republic of China (Taiwan) travelling to the European Union Member States and Schengen States has been adopted by such a huge and significant majority, I sincerely congratulate the people of Taiwan. From now on, they will be able to travel to EU Member States without a visa. Furthermore, from today, all citizens of EU Member States, including Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania, will also be able to travel to Taiwan without a visa. I feel that Taiwan and its people deserve such a decision and I welcome this decision by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I and my group welcome the fact that the citizens of Taiwan can now travel freely to the European Union. However, as far as I am aware, none of the EU Member States has recognised Taiwan. Nevertheless, I am not opposed to the visa liberalisation and I think it is a good thing that Taiwanese people can visit the EU without needing a visa. However, what is happening about Europe’s newest state, Kosovo? A total of 22 EU Member States have recognised Kosovo and only five have not done so, but the discussion on visas with Kosovo has not even started. The Commission has still not got under way with this. I hope that Mrs Malmström will finally begin a discussion on visas with Kosovo in order to make it clear that the citizens of Europe’s newest state can travel just as freely as the citizens of Taiwan.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the European Energy Programme for Recovery is an instrument used to finance investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Projects which can begin quickly and which will contribute directly to making the economy greener are worthwhile. The agreement, which ultimately released SEK 1.4 billion for the programme, represents a step towards a Europe that, with our combined efforts, will contribute to making it simpler and cheaper to be environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The launching of energy efficiency projects will create new jobs, make the economy greener and also enable us to be less dependent on oil-producing countries, which is particularly important in these times of crisis. This is exactly how the EU should work. Money that is not used can be allocated to other beneficial projects by means of this type of revolving fund. It took time for the Council to realise this, however. The negotiations were very difficult and the Member States did everything they could to try and wriggle out of their earlier promises. Today, I am pleased that we MEPs did not give in.</p>
      <p sl="sv">During the negotiations, I endeavoured to introduce simpler rules and transparency in the application process. I am therefore very pleased that the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council is also clearly focused on keeping administrative costs down.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, yesterday, the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, made an extraordinary speech in which he said that it was impossible to be outside the European Union in a globalised world. Of course, hence the lengthy dole queues snaking across Norway, or the food riots in Switzerland. But he went on to say something else: he said that the dangerous thing about eurosceptism today is that modern patriotism is based on a denigration of other countries, and here he could not be more wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">A true patriot cheers the freedom of all peoples and values the patriotism of other countries. When Mr Van Rompuy went on to make his second point, which is that eurosceptism equals nationalism equals war, he would perhaps have been well advised to look at the aims of the allied powers in the two wars whose end we commemorate today. They were fighting for the freedom of all nations, for the restoration of sovereignty of all European countries. It was thanks to their patriotism that Europe was not united in tyranny, that sovereignty and independence were restored and, indeed, that the European Union became possible. Today of all days, he ought to remember that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the decision of President Barack Obama to attend the EU-US summit this month in Lisbon and I voted in favour of the resolution today. There are so many important issues to be discussed. The EU-US agenda is full as ever, and both parties should use the opportunity to advance common positions on issues such as financial regulation, climate change, deepening of treaties and the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Economic recovery, however, has to be the number one issue on the agenda. Our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity. Together, our economies account for half of the global economy. Therefore, we need to devise common strategies for our further actions to ensure a stable recovery from the crisis, including regulating the financial markets, the stimulus packages and strategies to efficiently address currency manipulation by other major global players.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have voted against the Mann report because it is an example of politically correct self-blindness. Despite the fact that the mass immigration over the past 20 years has had disastrous socio-economic, social and political consequences, Mr Mann wants to allow even more immigration from outside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I found particularly cynical paragraph 110, which states that ‘the creation of a climate among the population of the host country which accepts immigrants depends directly on proper and comprehensive information’. What this really means, in plain language, is that we will have even more one-sided government propaganda coming our way for multiculturalism, which has been a complete failure, and mass immigration. After all, if you want proper and comprehensive information about immigration policy, you will ultimately have to make a cost-benefit analysis of it and that is precisely what the immigration lobby does not want.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have to say this resolution as a compromise was fine, but it seems to many in this House that it is too lengthy and it does not directly deal with the points we need to be making. It needs to be separated and shortened: the Transatlantic Economic Council issues could be shortened to maybe a 10-point plan, a three-point plan or whatever, so that we can actually use it when we finally go to speak to the Administration and our Congressional colleagues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe we also need to discuss issues such as a zero-tariff game, where current trade between the US and the EU can be enhanced and competitiveness can be increased by engaging in such a process. This could involve agriculture, but anyway, it is going to enhance whatever we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Parliament must not wait for the Administration to determine what we do in TEC. We should set the agenda ourselves. It is all very fine voting for this – and I voted for it because I helped to negotiate it – but because of that, I realise that it also has its weaknesses. I think we should then look to the new Congress under John Boehner, who I am sure will be announced as Speaker, and Darrell Issa and his colleagues who we probably must welcome, in order to be able to do better business in the future on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because in my view, the European Parliament has to demonstrate that it takes seriously the issues of security, the fight against terrorism and organised and transnational crime. We are also serious in taking into account our relations with partners such as the United States, Canada and Australia.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the European Parliament now has to give its consent to the agreements between the EU and third countries on the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, with a view to concluding those agreements. We must therefore use this power responsibly.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of the fact that Parliament has already decided once, on 5 May this year, to postpone the vote on the request for consent for the agreements with the USA and Australia, and that the current EU-Canada agreement on the transfer of PNR is no longer valid, we should make sure that when the time comes, we give the green light to these important measures, which will enhance security in the transatlantic area and beyond.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the Innovation Union initiative is crucial for the future of Europe. In Poznań, in the region of Wielkopolska, where I live, the regional authorities have, for several years, held an annual event called World Innovation Days. This is a very valuable initiative, precisely because it is proper coordination at regional, national and European level that can make the Innovation Union project a success. Therefore, I endorsed the resolution on European Innovation Partnerships within the Innovation Union flagship initiative, and I think we should all be involved in action for innovation, because, as I have said, it is very important for the future.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this very important resolution because I feel that the European Union’s role in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is particularly important for achieving the objectives set by the OSCE. Furthermore, it must be stressed that although they are very different structures, both the European Union and the OSCE follow the same principles and values, that is to say, respect for human rights and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I agree with the resolution’s provision calling on Kazakhstan to take concrete steps prior to the High Level Meeting in order to safeguard and respect fundamental OSCE values – human rights and the principles of the rule of law and freedom of expression. A public forum is due at the same time as the OSCE summit, and I really want it to be a success, free from any obstacles. Once more, I would like to stress that the OSCE must be led by countries that respect human rights and defend human rights and democratic values. They should be an example to other OSCE Members.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe that it makes useful and interesting proposals for facing future demographic challenges. Members States’ social policies must devote particular attention to young people, the true driving force behind development and growth. We must encourage the immediate inclusion of young people in the labour market and their ongoing training to promote professional growth.</p>
      <p sl="it">The family must also be protected by means of more incisive and substantial measures because forgetting the family means overlooking one of the essential components of society. I therefore emphasise the importance of the paragraphs containing measures designed to promote the family.</p>
      <p sl="it">Besides, if we are to be able to manage the effects of ageing in a better and more effective way, we must also support the updating of social protection systems and pension schemes in particular. As Altiero Spinelli said, ‘creating Europe depends on you as well’, and this is now a real possibility.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the demographic changes which have taken place in the European Union over the last few decades have drawn attention to the necessity of reforming the system of social and retirement care and developing an effective migration policy. Encouraging people to take early retirement has become a common practice, and this has caused a fall in professional activity among people between the ages of 55 and 64. At the same time, a very serious problem is the unemployment rate among young people, which is higher than in any other age group. In relation to this, we should strive both to include and to retain in the labour market a workforce comprising different age groups. In addition, a more open migration policy combined with effective assimilation and integration could mitigate the results of insufficient population growth. Of course, I endorsed the report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I endorsed the Mann report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations. It is a very good report, on a subject which is, itself, extremely important. The question of the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of age in access to goods and services is a key issue. If we are talking about solidarity, we should always remember, too, about this specific aspect of solidarity – solidarity between generations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Older people must not suffer discrimination because of their age. They have full rights as members of the local, regional, national and European community. The European Union looks after its young people – they are, for example, one of the priorities of next year’s budget. This is good, because it is the young people, after all, who are going to decide the future of Europe, but, on the other hand, we should remember those who have already made their own very significant contribution to the building of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I fully support the Mann report. Indeed, I believe that solidarity between the generations is just as important as solidarity between Member States. I want to highlight three particular issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully agree with paragraph 24, which speaks about an end to a compulsory retirement age so that people can choose when they want to finish working, but, at the same time, seeks to maintain a pensionable age, so that people who want to retire can do so and receive their benefits.</p>
      <p sl="en">I was particularly pleased to see that a number of my amendments on carers and family carers were taken into consideration, in particular, paragraph 125, which speaks about family carers, including the right for them to choose whether they wish to care or not, and also the ability to combine caring with paid work, and to ensure that they have full access to social security schemes and old age pensions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am, however, equally supportive of the European Youth Guarantee initiative, which proposes that any young people who have been unemployed for four months or longer will be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training, etc., all of this to support their reintegration, or integration, into the workplace. As I said at the beginning, solidarity between the generations is crucial, especially in the current economic situation.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this document by Thomas Mann because it reflects the problems of intergenerational interaction. Usually, we talk of the European Union’s demographic problems from the point of view of young people. This document attempts to combine the specific characteristics of all the generations and related problems in health, education, labour and similar sectors, seeking balanced solutions to those problems.</p>
      <p sl="lt">As far as the older generation is concerned, we should be grateful for its contribution to the development of the European Union, both economically and culturally. We must ensure that these people can grow old with dignity. However, due to ageing Europe, it seems that it will be quite difficult to achieve this. We must therefore not only create conditions for the improvement of family policy, but bring up a young generation which would be able to create added value, i.e. through the education system and non-formal education. Of course, we must make efforts as regards the integration of young people into the labour market. So thank you for this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, demographers tell us that in order to sustain itself, a population needs a birth rate of 2.1 live births per woman. In the whole of Europe, the only country that is reproducing at sustainability level is Albania, or Turkey if you count Turkey as a European country – and nowhere else. According to one UN report, Europe, including European Russia, is scheduled to lose 100 million people over the next 40 years. Germany alone is going to see a shrinkage of its population by 20 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are not projections about what might happen if we do not do something, as there is nothing we can do about it now since the decline in birth rates has already happened. The only question is how we deal with it. How did we get to this stage? What brought us to this pass? One does not want to oversimplify, as there are obviously a lot of things going on, to do with changing working patterns, the spread of contraception, the different role of women in society, and longevity.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I wonder whether one part of the problem is the way in which the state has expanded and squeezed out the private sphere, has annexed to itself jobs and duties that were traditionally discharged within a family – childcare, education and social security. The first generation raised with cradle to grave welfare or, in other words, to be excused the traditional responsibilities of adulthood, has also been the first to give up on parenthood.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now face a choice between demographic collapse or importing 100 million people to sustain our numbers and pay our pensions. This should be the top issue in Europe and it is not one we can address by arguing about changes in employment regulation.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the Commission’s proposal that our research framework programmes should go through a simplifying process. Over time, these programmes expanded due to good tender opportunities but, at the same time, the uncertainties related to administration and control increased. We need a new scheme that has greater confidence in tenderers and which, in addition to strengthening scientific and technical evaluation processes, also takes into account the simplification of financial and administrative processes.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Naturally, there is a degree of risk in any financial transaction, but the exaggerated administrative control of such risks also increases the total costs of the whole process. We must strive to ensure that our research is attractive and accessible for the world’s best researchers, European enterprises and universities. This also requires the harmonisation of rules and procedures as soon as possible, which should be done even during the Seventh Framework Programme, but certainly during the preparation of the eighth. For this reason, I, too, voted in favour of this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the foundation of Europe’s economic development is investment in education as a form of investment in human capital and innovations which contribute to the creation of modern methods and technologies. To invest in innovation, it is necessary to concentrate on subsidising research. An example, here, are the framework programmes we have debated, which are the largest international research programmes in the world. By subsidising this kind of research, Europe has the opportunity to improve competitiveness in the global arena, create jobs for thousands of people and improve the quality of life of all Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to maintain the highest standards in the framework programmes, the rapporteur has endorsed the maximum possible reductions in bureaucracy and simplification of administrative procedures. As a result, this would allow easier access to funding for this research in the European Union, and this, after all, is what we want. Needless to say, I endorsed the report.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, facilitating access to the support system envisaged in the framework research programme means giving great impetus to the competitive capacity of the entire European production system. I am convinced that with today’s vote, we have made a considerable contribution to achieving this essential aim, particularly for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which constitutes the backbone of the economy of every Member State. In fact, despite the high quality of their output, such businesses often do not succeed in gaining easy access to the resources that are necessary for boosting their production standards even higher.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is also useful to point out, as the rapporteur did, that the voting was extremely timely because it followed immediately from the intermediate evaluation of the Seventh Framework Programme and the preparation of the eighth. I thank the rapporteur for her work.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted for the document on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes in the European Union. Unfortunately, I should point out that I missed the broader discussions during the plenary session, but the document itself is really important, and I welcome its adoption.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is important to establish a level playing field for scientists from all EU Member States, to provide equal payment for research activities, without dividing scientists according to their country’s standard of living, because scientific progress is a matter for the whole of the European Union, not just individual countries. At present, the prevailing attitude is that work by scientists from the new Member States is less valuable than that done by scientists from the old Member States. Such a discriminatory practice is wrong and unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is also important to ensure equal conditions for all research institutions, and not to divide them according to their size and financial capacity. This is particularly important for research institutions in the new EU Member States. It is not the size of organisations but scientific progress that creates value. Therefore, it is important to provide opportunities, not just for universities, but for non-profit research institutes and other scientific organisations, to submit applications and participate in research programmes. Therefore, I congratulate all scholars, and together with improved research mechanisms, we will move forward.</p>

That is something we have control over and we should deal with it, and we have been sitting on our hands and refusing to deal with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also heard about the high cost of compliance with EU regulations, so that we do not have a level playing field for third country imports. But perhaps one of the most crucial issues is the whole area of the food chain. Yesterday, the Court of Auditors issued a report on the sugar sector and one of their recommendations was that price formation be subject to regular monitoring by the Commission and that the Commission and the Member States ensure that competition law is correctly enforced in the sector, thus ensuring the treaty objective that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. It is not only in the sugar sector that we need to do that. We need to do it in the whole food chain.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution because for years in Europe, we have seen frequent crises affecting the livestock sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">The causes are many, including a reduction in demand for mutton, lamb and goatmeat, partly due to the large-scale import of meat from third countries. The livestock sector has also been struck by indirect causes, however. I am referring to problems in the milk and dairy sector and the problem of cereal price volatility, which has seen severe speculation.</p>
      <p sl="it">With a view to CAP reform after 2013, it will be necessary to tackle the matter with commitment and come up with measures necessary for limiting the impact of price volatility in the agricultural sector once and for all. I therefore call on the Commission to develop more rapid instruments that make it possible to face up to the crisis situations within each individual Common Market Organisation speedily.</p>

      <p sl="ga">However, I want to say a couple of things. Firstly, the Court of Auditors report yesterday was a damning indictment of the Commission, showing that after EUR 1.2 billion in compensation, the closure of many factories and the loss of thousands of jobs, we are now only 85% self-sufficient in sugar supply.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, during the week, I attended an agriculture seminar here and the same situation applied to fish coming into the European Union, particularly from Vietnam, some of which could even be polluted. In the livestock sector, the same applies, where third countries exporting commodities into the European Union can do so at an advantage compared to those within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ga">A sine qua non for the European Union in addressing all these issues is to ensure that the same standards of regulation, the same checks and balances, and the same stringent enforcement applies to products coming in from third countries as to our own producers within the European Union.</p>

The support provided by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is urgently needed by the workers, their families and the North Dublin community, deeply affected by the closure of this company, which brought the loss of more than a thousand skilled jobs. I led an SR Technics delegation to meet Commissioner Špidla in mid-2009, when the availability of this fund was confirmed to us. It then took the Irish Government six months to apply for the EGF, and seven more to answer to the Commission’s request for clarifications. The slow and ineffective handling of the Dell application risks a return of much of the allocation to Brussels, and this lesson was disregarded. The Irish Government must act more swiftly to ensure that this aid is granted directly to those who need it, that it is not used to replace government funding, and that the training and re-skilling programmes offered are suited to the workers’ needs. Astonishingly, the government is only now preparing to establish a coordinator for the fund, four years after its inception.</p>

The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of businesses, and it is crucial in facilitating access to new employment in the future. The EGF has already been used in the past by other EU countries, so we should now grant this aid to Ireland, which has requested assistance for 850 workers made redundant from the company SR Technics Ireland Ltd, operating in the air transport sector, in the NUTS III Dublin region.</p>

The money can be used to pay for help in finding new jobs, tailor-made training, assistance in becoming self-employed or starting up a company, mobility and support for disadvantaged or older workers. In order for the employees of a company to receive this support, at least 500 workers must have been made redundant within a period of four months.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the European Parliament Resolution on the mobilisation of the EGF for granting aid to redundant workers. In October 2009, Ireland submitted a request for assistance to use the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in connection with the redundancies which were made in the company SR Technics, operating in the air transport sector in the Dublin region of Ireland. The global financial and economic crisis has reduced the level of air transport activity, which has resulted in a huge wave of redundancies in this sector too. In Ireland, 1 135 redundancies were recorded between April and August 2009, including 850 made at the company SR Technics Ireland Ltd. While acknowledging the important role played by the EGF in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market, which is also corroborated by the 11 or so applications approved in 2010 alone, amounting to a total of more than EUR 30 million, I believe that this instrument is still not sufficiently well known and used by Member States.

Such regulation plays a crucial role, because it replaces regulation at national level with regulation at European level, and provides for conditions for taking into account the specificities of the various funds covered, on the basis of their systemic risk. The establishment of rules of conduct for all financial services is being considered at a time of crisis, as is promoting a truly single market by making a framework of common European rules possible.

      <p sl="fr">The financial crisis that has hit the European Union hard has its roots in the ‘unbridled’ activity of numerous investment funds, particularly those from the United States. Amongst these funds, the alternative funds, or hedge funds, are characterised by aggressive speculation. This appears to be one of the major causes of the disaster, the consequences of which we are suffering today. In order to protect the future of the European market from the excesses of these alternative funds, I voted for the report by my colleague, Mr Gauzès. This text represents a major step forward in financial regulation. With this vote, we reinforce the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This European authority for financial markets will be set up on 1 January 2011 and will deliver, under strict conditions, a ‘passport’ permitting the activity of managers of alternative funds located in the European Union. The directive requires them to be authorised or registered, to respect operational and organisational requirements, and observe rules of conduct and transparency. It will subject them to the supervisory powers and ability to apply sanctions of the competent authorities of the Member States and of ESMA.

It is necessary to clarify the powers and duties of the competent authorities responsible for implementing this directive and to strengthen the mechanisms needed to ensure effective cross-border cooperation in the field of monitoring.</p>

      <p sl="el">The overblown financial system and its speculative action and lack of transparency were what caused the financial crisis. The crisis – like all crises – needs to be addressed with structural changes, a different modus operandi and barriers to prevent toxic products from being channelled into the economy. Supervisory measures, which need to be mainstreamed, are also important. However, neither the Commission directive nor the European Parliament’s report guarantee real supervision and control of hedge funds and private equity. With its numerous exemptions and the terms laid down in the report for the purpose of supervision, speculation and a lack of transparency would appear to be here to stay. That is why I voted against the report.</p>

By creating a ‘European passport’ system, the European Union is imposing a kind of ‘code of conduct’ on these financial bodies, which will now have to meet certain conditions within the European area. As a result, the single market will become more transparent and efficient.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Following Parliament’s vote, the Union is, at long last, going to regulate the activities of the most speculative investment funds. A long time has passed since Poul Rasmussen’s own-initiative report which, back in 2008, proposed that strict limits should be imposed on these ‘financial black holes’. It has taken the financial crisis to make the Member States and the majority of Parliament agree to adopt binding legislation on alternative funds. For the first time, these funds, whether or not they are based in Europe, will be subject to controls, restrictions on their activities and greater transparency; carving up businesses will no longer be possible, and the European Securities and Markets Authority’s supervisory powers will be extended. Much remains to be done to supervise finance effectively in Europe; ESMA, not the national authorities, should be the only authority with responsibility for this matter, and businesses should be protected even more from speculation. Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives, the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation. This is merely a first step. The text we have adopted will be revised in four years’ time. This will be an opportunity to go further, on the basis of an assessment, in order to protect the economy and jobs from the damage caused by speculation.</p>

By adopting, by a large majority, the report on alternative funds and capital investment, Parliament continues to implement new rules for better economic governance. Managers of alternative investment funds, which account for nearly USD 1 000 billion in assets, play an important role in the financing of the European economy. Although these funds are not directly at the root of the financial crisis, their management must not escape the need to regulate all actors in the financial services. Parliament has obtained the inclusion of new chapters on asset stripping and pay and has done a great deal to influence the rules regulating the passport system, responsibility of the depositary, requirements for own funds and recourse to leveraging.</p>

      <p sl="pt">However, in truth, we have not got to the bottom of this issue: these speculative funds have not been abolished and there is still a derivatives market, meaning that the mechanisms allowing speculation still exist. An excellent opportunity to properly regulate the financial markets has been wasted. The Council and the majority of the European Parliament yielded in the face of enormous pressure from the financial lobby.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The financial crisis has shown that the origins of the global financial system’s dysfunctions are, firstly, excessive exposure to risk – these funds are an example of this – and, secondly, the weakness of the systems for managing this risk. The new European regulations establish common requirements for the authorisation and supervision of hedge funds, but they are far from preventing the continuation of serious systemic risk. We cannot, therefore, vote for this proposal.</p>

I deplore, in particular, the weakness of the provisions on leverage, the weakness of the guarantees regarding offshore funds, which will be able to obtain a passport, and the weakness of the obligations incumbent on private equity funds, which are often experts in stripping the assets of unlisted companies. I deplore the fact that we have to tolerate these predators operating throughout the EU subject to registration and minimum checks.

Many commendable advances have been made, such as, for example, the supervision of fund managers’ pay in order neither to encourage nor reward disproportionate risk taking, to give just one example. The directive is clearly going in the right direction, even though it does have some serious shortcomings. In particular, it is disappointing that supervision is left to national authorities and not to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) created recently at the time of the vote on the financial supervision package.

      <p sl="pt">The financial crisis which occurred in 2007 was led by major investment banks which had a series of alternative investment funds, or hedge funds, in their portfolio. These were not supervised and often consisted of assets of doubtful value. The crisis reflected this situation, and now it is necessary to take concrete measures to ensure that new crises do not recur in the future, caused by financial mechanisms that no one controls and that often cannot be quantified.

This directive is extremely important and timely, since financial and stock market speculators and dishonest investors will always try to exploit these funds for their personal enrichment.

On the one hand, it is important to reduce the risk of losses and to minimise the potential for faulty decision making at a management level.

The aim of this directive must also be to create incentives for transferring offshore funds to the Union, thus guaranteeing advantages in terms of the regulation and protection of investors while also setting the correct level of income for managers, funds and alternative investors.

This commitment to the ‘creativity’ of the financial industry forgets the intrinsically destabilising and voracious scale of the speculation, of critical importance with this type of funds. The proposed regulations are also extraordinarily weak. They include so many exceptions and derogations at European level that they do not really break with the model of differential national regulation currently in force. The report also fails to clearly separate those who work with this type of funds and those who work in traditional banking activities, or to block the actions of speculative funds located in tax havens. Instead, by setting ‘thresholds’ on the value of ‘systemically relevant’ assets, it is clearing the way for formal fragmentation processes that will remove large numbers of the investment companies that are meant to be covered by the directive from its scope.

It is a step forward for European ambition to have financial governance operational from the start of 2011. These new rules would make the international financial system more responsible and transparent and make it possible to limit speculation. According to the directive, investors in speculative funds based in countries outside the EU (hedge fund managers are often resident in tax havens) will be forced to abide by the same conditions imposed on all European enterprises in order to operate within the EU market.

      <p sl="sk">It is quite right for us to try and learn from the mistakes that led to the global financial crisis. Although regulation is essential in some sectors, I personally prefer transparency and a duty to inform. If the banks had a duty to inform clients how they are handling their money, and what that means for them, a crisis could not happen. Regulation restricting the activities of businesses should be a solution only when the error in question cannot be corrected – for example, where human health or life is at stake. Let us therefore be careful when we regulate. The role of public institutions is not to deprive people of responsibility for their decisions, but to ensure they have the information they need when making decisions. Let us not forget that natural support for research and education comes from private sources, or investment funds, which lend money to promising entrepreneurial projects and invest in the development of new technologies, all with an awareness and a weighing up of the possible risks. If our quest for security reduces the appetite of investors to look for new opportunities in the EU, we shall always remain dependent on inefficient and bureaucratic public investment programmes. We shall then lag even further behind in the area of technology. I regard the submitted report as a compromise which addresses some of my concerns over regulation in this sector.

I would like to emphasise the remarkable economic progress which has been made by Taiwan. Taiwan conducts a significant volume of trade with the EU and its economy is number 25 in the world, continuing to grow by more than 13% annually. This sustained development reduces the chances of the EU facing an influx of illegal migrants from Taiwan. This is why I believe that facilitating the movement of persons must become one of the key features of bilateral cooperation. The decision to waive the compulsory visa requirement for Taiwanese nationals also takes into account their fulfilment of the technical conditions on travel document security. The introduction of biometric passports in 2008 is one of the constructive measures implemented so far. I hope that the European Parliament’s decision will be approved by the Council and that the new provision will even enter into force this year.

Economically, Taiwan has seen significant growth in recent years, and its income per head of population is currently the highest in the world. Taiwan is also an excellent partner cooperating in the fields of science, investment, new technology, education, culture and tourism. Therefore, lifting the visa requirement for Taiwan will enhance trade and economic relations with the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour as I believe that Taiwan should be transferred to the positive list for granting visa exemption. Given the existing trade relations between the EU and Taiwan, I believe that this decision will have a positive impact. Most of the countries in this region that have a similar level of development have already obtained visa exemption, and this decision reinforces the EU’s decision to prioritise policies which contribute to economic growth and the creation of more and better jobs, along with policies that contribute to competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I support the awarding of a visa waiver for travel by nationals of Taiwan, and therefore the country’s transfer to the positive list. This decision will have a favourable economic impact on relations between the EU and Taiwan, which is already our 19th most important trade partner. The EU is also the largest foreign investor in Taiwan. It should encourage tourism: the EU is already one of the most important destination regions for Taiwanese nationals. It does not, by contrast, increase the risk of illegal immigration, since the average rate in 2006-2008 was 45 people, which is very low, or threaten public security. It increases regional consistency, since the vast majority of the region’s countries and entities with a similar level of economic development already benefit from this visa waiver scheme: Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. I welcome Taiwan’s adoption of the measures necessary to ensure a high level of passport and identity card security, with the introduction of biometric passports, as well as the measures announced to prevent the various Member States of the EU from being treated differently.</p>

While we should always treat those seeking entry into our countries humanely and respect their human rights, I believe that the EU is right to thoroughly analyse which countries can be included on the positive list.

      <p sl="it">The list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas is established on the basis of a careful case-by-case assessment of the situation in the country concerned, taking into account illegal immigration, security issues, the European Union’s external relations and the principle of reciprocity. Understandably, given that these criteria are likely to change over time, the legislation on the subject provides for a procedure to review the list of countries, so that it is possible to change the number of countries which enjoy exemptions from visa requirements. The proposal of Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, which was approved today, relates to moving the island of Taiwan on to said list. Over recent decades, Taiwan has, in fact, undergone a major process of democratisation, which has led it to strike up an important economic and trade relationship with the European Union.

Institutional reforms, the dynamism of civil society and respect for freedoms and civil rights have contributed to political stabilisation in Taiwan. In addition, Taiwan is active in many areas at international level, and this includes aid for the victims of natural disasters. Taiwan, today, shows high economic growth and low unemployment. Since the 1950s, Taiwan has gone through many successful reforms. In political terms, Taiwan has completed a process of far-reaching democratisation. The changes of the 1980s led to the first democratic elections being held there in 1996. The EU and Taiwan maintain economic and commercial relations on a large scale. The EU is the biggest foreign investor in Taiwan. Taiwan is the EU’s fourth largest trading partner in Asia. There is also cooperation on research and education, culture and the environment. The numbers of illegal immigrants to the EU from Taiwan are very low. The citizens of most EU Member States, with the exception of Cyprus, Romania and Bulgaria, do not require a visa to enter Taiwan. The citizens of these three Member States are also to be included in visa-free travel arrangements in the very near future. I am certain that lifting the visa requirement for Taiwanese citizens will contribute to a still greater improvement in commercial relations and relations in the areas of research, education, culture and environment, and to an increase in tourist travel between the EU and Taiwan.</p>

It is important that we stop these scandals and ensure that the Schengen rules are followed. The principle of reciprocity should apply to visa requirements, but the example of the USA, which openly uses visa requirements as a threat during negotiations, shows that this is not always the case. It is also important to distinguish between the different third countries. Taiwan is a special case. Until now, it has had relatively good economic growth, which leads the EU to assume that there is a low risk of illegal immigration.

Liberalising visa requirements for Taiwan will strengthen the trade relationships between the country and the European Union and will facilitate closer collaboration in the sectors of culture, education, environment and research, as well as promoting the growth of tourism in both directions.

To some extent, their inclusion makes it necessary to shift the focus from essentially cross-border projects to more regional ones, which will have a wider-ranging impact throughout Europe. We must remember that the cost of the necessary initial investment is one of the main problems faced by regional small and medium-sized enterprises when investing in renewable-energy projects, which is mentioned in this regulation. The introduction of technical support for implementing these projects is welcome. I would also stress the point mentioned by the rapporteur that the budgetary problems of regional authorities in times of crisis must not prevent them accessing the funding.

I am, in fact, convinced that this financial instrument takes on even greater significance in the light of the financial crisis because it can help businesses recover more effectively and can, in the future, constitute a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund.

It is well known that this type of project has particularly large initial costs and that there is a collective advantage in supporting those who take the risk of investing in this area.

      <p sl="lt">I would like to thank the author of the report for an excellent legislative initiative, which I supported, because the financing of projects in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy will help stimulate the economic recovery, create jobs and promote social integration and the attractiveness of the regions. These projects are most effective when implemented at municipal, regional and local level, but in duly justified cases, it may be more effective to aim at national level. As the current financial and economic crisis and the resulting lower budgetary income are having a particularly adverse effect on the finances of local and regional authorities, it should be ensured that the difficult budgetary situation of those authorities does not hinder them from being able to access the funding. I am happy that a short-term economic impact is required, and that the time between receipt of an application for a project and the financial decision should not exceed six months. As we know, the EU’s dependence on countries supplying oil and gas is increasing. In some countries, projects for the renovation of buildings, gas and electricity infrastructure projects, inter-connectors, wind farms, and Carbon Capture and Storage projects (CCS) are taking a long time to move forward. Unspent funds from these projects may be allocated to this field. The report is particularly relevant for Lithuania, which is becoming increasingly dependent on energy from Russia. Therefore, I hope that the government will make every effort to obtain financing and will target financial resources at local level in order to create added value, a direct benefit for citizens, thereby reducing energy poverty. I also hope that the report will not drown in red tape.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I completely support the notion that we must allocate EUR 146 million to projects in the field of energy. This will have a tangible effect if the funds are applied sensibly. First, this decision will give the green light to all those who are seeking a significant cost reduction in the manufacturing, transport and transit sectors. There will be cost reductions, which means that income will go up and, in turn, by implementing a balanced fiscal policy, EU countries will be able to overcome the consequences of the global financial crisis more swiftly. The allocation of EU funds to projects in the field of energy is a good stimulus for the heads of EU governments, local authorities and businesses.</p>

This is one of the reasons why research and innovation lie at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. On the one hand, it is important that the regulations on subsidies are clear, in order to prevent abuse as far as possible. However, on the other hand, the controls must not result in small businesses and SMEs being indirectly excluded because of the complexity of the subsidy process. Therefore, the regulations on subsidies must be reviewed every few years with these points in mind and, wherever possible, must also be simplified. The planned review will not meet this requirement, which is why I have voted against it.</p>

The ongoing structural crisis is, paradoxically, an important opportunity for putting this back on the table. The difficulties that the major economic systems have experienced may allow Europe to recover. That, however, will require the vision, capacity and courage of a new strategy.

Funds will be targeted at supporting local and regional authorities in projects that should prove economically and financially efficient, so as to ensure a return on the investment in good time. A total of EUR 146.34 million should be made available from January 2011 to 31 March 2014. Contributions received may take the form of loans, guarantees, equities or other financial products.

The fund shall finance initiatives and energy projects, adopting a different philosophy from the past, no longer focusing on straight grants, which have many times been shown to be disastrous, but on the profitability of the investment. If used well, I believe that this new formula will herald the coming of a new virtuous cycle for the revitalisation of the European economy. Furthermore, the new financing instrument represents an important opportunity for the development of local entities, above all, those in the south of Italy. In fact, the fund could also be integrated with other European funds, such as the European Regional Development Fund, for example. By voting decisively in favour of this new fund, I am expressing my hope that this innovative type of financing could also be extended in the future to many other sectors, starting with road, rail, port and airport infrastructure.</p>

The intention is for these new investment projects to contribute to creating jobs and increasing competitiveness in the sector. I support the report’s stress on the importance of increasing decentralised investments, since the beneficiaries of the initiatives will be public authorities at the various levels of government, whether municipal, regional or national.

At the upcoming EU-US summit, both partners must cooperate on moving forward with a common agenda based on shared values such as the defence of democracy, of the rule of law and of human rights. During a period of serious crisis and on the eve of a crucial G20 meeting, the EU and the US, which account for half the world economy between them, must be more committed than ever to working closely together on global economic recovery and on establishing measures for regulating the global financial system. Joint action is needed on the great challenges faced by the world – the struggle against climate change, achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the Middle East peace process, the specific situations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and even the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Such action must be the result of increased strategic dialogue and cooperation between the EU and the US, within the framework of existing multilateral institutions, notably the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and NATO.

The revival of the dialogue between our two great powers, and the promotion of multilateral negotiations which characterises the policy of the new Obama administration, accentuate the importance of this text.

It is therefore necessary to develop bilateral cooperation as regards the preparation of a joint energy strategy, which would support diversification and security of energy and supply routes, promoting an ecologically efficient economy.

The desire to achieve well-being for our peoples by democratic means – through the free market, more humane working conditions, social systems that work and all the other achievements that make our countries what they are today – counts for much more than a dominant position in an international league table that can provide raw data but not convey emotions or reflect quality of life.

The US and the EU are seeking to ‘coordinate’ strategies, using a panoply of economic, diplomatic and military means to reverse this development. The majority in this House are not deviating from their choice of neoliberalism; instead, they are intensifying it, hoping that new steps will emerge from this summit towards greater ‘economic integration’ and the establishment of the ‘transatlantic market’.

I believe that, to this end, the conclusion of a transatlantic market by 2015 is a good way of further developing the economic relationship between our two areas and being stronger in the face of the fits and starts of the global economy. Furthermore, as the United States and the EU are old partners which share many values (democracy, respect for human rights), we would like a transatlantic inquiry set up to shed light on suspicions of torture in Iraq.

      <p sl="cs">Regarding the draft agreement between the European Union and the US on personal data protection in relation to the transfer and processing of data within the framework of police and judicial cooperation, we should ask one fundamental question: whether both sides have a balanced interest in the agreement. In my opinion, this is not the case, as the interest of the US in obtaining data on EU citizens comes first. If we look more closely at the differences between the systems of both parties for protecting personal data, we soon see that it is almost impossible to conclude an agreement of this kind – if we are to uphold the standards of personal data protection provided for in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. It is, moreover, absolutely essential that, prior to the negotiations on such an agreement between the EU and the US, regulations be adopted on the protection of private individuals in the processing of personal data by bodies, institutions and other organisations of the EU and the Member States, as set out in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The only virtue of this resolution is that it recommends the universal abolition of the death penalty and calls on the United States to accede to the International Criminal Court.

How can Parliament declare itself in favour of the completion of the large transatlantic market, that colossal project carried out behind the European public’s back? How can it welcome the SWIFT agreement, the transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, the Open Skies agreement between Europe and the United States, greenhouse gas emission allowance trading and the anti-democratic institutions that are behind the Multidisciplinary Group on International Action against Terrorism (GMT)?

This relationship remains a major priority for the European Union. Besides the fact that the EU and the United States share a number of common interests and values, such as the promotion of peace, democracy, respect for human rights, and the market economy, they have the world’s most important bilateral trade and investment relationship: the transatlantic economy is worth USD 4 280 billion. Our reality is one of ever closer economic integration. The full importance of this relationship can also be seen in the context of development cooperation, given that together, the United States and the European Union provide almost 80% of development aid. Lastly, our partnership is vital for making the world a more stable place and for discussing major multilateral issues, such as climate change, energy, the economic and financial crisis, crisis management, development cooperation, regional matters, non-proliferation and disarmament, and security.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The EU and the USA have many points of contact and are playing a dominant role in solving global problems. However, we must learn good practice from each other and strengthen our partnership in order to ensure the effectiveness of actions. These problems are relevant as far as climate change, a healthy environment and food security are concerned. The huge ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico offered hope that the US Government will take appropriate steps to ensure care for the environment and work towards solving the challenges of climate change. The EU must play an active role at the Climate Change conference in Cancún. It is important for the USA to become part of this agreement because sometimes, there is the impression that it would be easier to reach an agreement with developing countries than with the USA. We must find ways of promoting links between the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and regional or federal trading schemes in the US. We must also seek a transatlantic partnership on strategic energy issues – on security of energy supply and policies to move towards low carbon energy sources. One issue of transatlantic cooperation concerns a healthy environment – novel foods and the use of new technologies in food production. EU society is not completely prepared for innovations, so countries must respect each other’s choices. A strong EU-US partnership must be beneficial to both sides and in a global context. I hope that the forthcoming EU-US summit will represent a step towards this goal.</p>

It is important for Parliament to make its opinion heard on this important summit with our greatest ally. Transatlantic relations have always been a crucial part of European foreign policy. Even in a globalised world, in which some experts see the axis shifting from the west towards the powers of the east, I am still firmly convinced that the EU-US relationship is pivotal to stability, growth and prosperity, not only on both sides of the Atlantic, but throughout the world. We have strong roots in common; we share culture, lifestyles, outlooks and markets; and, most of all, we have always been the standard bearers for values, ideals and needs, whether ideological, economic or social, which have cast us in a leading role on the world stage. On account of the new global scenario and balance of power, however, I think we need to make our collaboration with Washington more operational, and for the EU to assert itself as a credible partner, it is vital to put across not just an image of cohesion but also the ability to take on concrete commitments.</p>

Given the importance of international issues at the present time, it is, in fact, essential to appeal to shared principles, interests and values, so that decisive steps can be taken at the upcoming EU-US summit towards advancing a wide-ranging common agenda that enables these challenges to be tackled effectively. It is also essential for the potential of the Transatlantic Economic Council to be fully exploited in order to overcome the existing barriers to establishing the transatlantic market by 2015, as well as to promote an integrated approach in the field of supervision and macro-economic policy, and in the area of the trade relationships of the EU and the US with third countries.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Security requirements for air transport have led the EU to sign, with different States, agreements for exchanging Passenger Name Record data (PNR data). Furthermore, the Treaty of Lisbon makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding, thereby protecting European citizens’ personal information. When it comes to renewing these exchange agreements, Parliament will have to approve any new agreement negotiated. There are two conflicting requirements on this issue. On the one hand, the fight against organised crime and terrorism, fostered by new communication media, and, on the other, the protection of privacy and of fundamental freedoms which these same communication media are jeopardising. I thought it important to offer my support to this text that perpetuates transatlantic cooperation against organised crime and terrorism, while devoting a large part to the guarantees necessary for European citizens’ freedoms.</p>

Acts of terrorism that have shocked the globe and growing organised crime in the areas of drug and human trafficking demand improved efforts to combat crime and terrorism. For such actions to work, they must go hand in hand with more effective, focused and faster exchanges of data both within Europe and globally. However, the main problem remains the issue of the protection of personal data, ensuring that such data is not used for any purpose other than preventing, investigating or detecting criminal offences. In my opinion, the Commission must ensure that any agreement or measure on the transfer of personal data must also stand the legal proportionality test and protect the confidentiality of personal data. As an institution representing citizens, in this process, the European Parliament must be informed by the Commission of all issues relating to the transfer of personal data, so that it might express its position on planned agreements. In this way, we will be able to find optimal solutions so that our citizens’ data is only used according to strictly regulated rules and the protection of their personal data is guaranteed.</p>

It is very important for PNR data not to be used for data mining or profiling and for data review not to simply be entrusted to an electronic system, but for decisions to be taken by people.

      <p sl="it">Freedom is one of the cardinal principles on which this House is based. This value is the foundation on which the European institutions are built, the power source that enables the market to drive a varied and complex economy, and the air that our citizens breathe as they travel to study or work in cities that once were places that they needed a passport and even a visa to reach. There is no question, therefore, as to its importance. The issue highlighted by this document is, rather, its relationship to security. There is no easy solution to this problem. The information must, in fact, be collected and analysed in the right places, but we have to remain watchful to prevent abuse. The checks on this procedure must be continual and constant and must prevent any leakage of data. We cannot allow people to see this as wanting to cast freedom aside, just as we cannot allow pressure for freedom to endanger the security of the people of Europe.

This is an approach which strikes the right balance between European Union Member States’ security requirements and strict respect for citizens’ rights and freedoms. The passenger name record is an extremely sensitive database which therefore needs to be protected to prevent any kind of damage being caused to those whose names feature in it. I feel it is important for us to ensure, as part of the agreement negotiations with the US, Australia and Canada, that the data cannot be used to create profiles by extracting certain data from the record.

That is why the protection of personal data must be guaranteed better. The European Parliament has one clear demand to make before the Commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging PNR data with the United States, Canada and Australia: the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among Member States, behind closed doors. They must be conducted transparently, at EU level. The data transferred must be used only within a strictly defined context and must not be transferred to a third country.

The available technological means constitute a significant challenge to respect for individual privacy. This concept, too, has been called into question by the increasing voluntary and involuntary exposure to which Europeans are now subjected. Europeans are also encountering the growing tension between the individual’s right to privacy and the collective right to security. All these issues have taken on worrying proportions since 11 September 2001 and remain current. Terrorism and other forms of organised crime are fought today with rapid and effective information exchanges between security agencies, rather than by conventional police forces. Without these exchanges, we would be exposed to concerted, cross-border criminal activity, with no chance of responding appropriately. For all these reasons, I believe that it is essential to open negotiations with our partners, so that we can face collective dangers together, and to ensure that the data exchanged between the parties comply with the principles of appropriateness and proportionality to the intended purposes.</p>

Those responsible for this capitulation by the European Parliament, which goes against positions taken in the past, are now seeking to nuance it by referring to alleged principles of ‘proportionality’ and ‘necessity’, which are always debatable and subjective to assess. The argument that there are Passenger Name Record data now that are already being transferred to third countries without any sort of checks does not hold.

I therefore welcome the Commission’s recommendation for negotiations to be opened with a view to concluding these agreements. Indeed, it has been evident for several years now that exchanging these data helps in the fight against terrorism and international crime. These international transfers of PNR data offer our countries’ law enforcement agencies precious means of combating the terrorist threat. Furthermore, I must stress that the new global approach to PNR data presented by the Commission in October and aimed at establishing general criteria specific to all PNR agreements is very positive in my view. It will create a more structured and more coherent framework for these agreements, and will provide significant guarantees in terms of the protection of personal data.</p>

That proposal endorses the transfer of PNR data to third countries and contains no satisfactory guarantee as to the way in which the data will be used. What is worse, it considers it justifiable to store these data for an unlimited period of time for profiling purposes. What is the point of this resolution’s self-righteous railing against a practice that is at the heart of a project it supports? I voted against this resolution, which violates every human being’s right to have his or her personal data respected.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Passenger Name Records (PNR) are another weapon in the fight against terrorism. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has to help set out a new external strategy regarding the negotiation of a new PNR agreement between the EU, the USA, Australia and Canada.

      <p sl="fr">I fully support the objective of preventing and combating terrorism and other serious transnational crime. More and more countries are using passenger data for this purpose. In the digital age, however, it is crucial to pay particular attention to the enforcement and protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights, including the right to privacy and data protection. The key principles that must be prioritised in this area are necessity and proportionality. The collection of passenger data must not just be useful; it must be necessary too. The principle of proportionality must also be invoked to prevent the planned measures from going above and beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives set. There can be no question, therefore, of using the data for the purposes of exploitation or profiling. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has made a major contribution to the efforts to conclude these agreements, and therefore it must be fully and regularly informed of any developments relating to PNR data.</p>

      <p sl="de">In recent years, fundamental rights have increasingly been curtailed as part of the so-called war on terror. The rationale behind this is extremely questionable. While passengers are searched almost down to their underwear and are not allowed to carry nail files or deodorant in their luggage, checks on freight are often left to the shipping companies themselves. If this is to change in future, it is important that the balance between freedom and security is preserved. In the case of passenger security checks, this balance has already been lost and, therefore, as the hysteria surrounding terrorism subsides, the regulations will once again be relaxed. Just as questionable is the issue of whether the FBI needs to know the name, address, e-mail address, credit card number and number of suitcases of people travelling to the USA and whether it should be permitted to store this data for up to 15 years. The information should only need to be kept in a few exceptional cases. If fundamental rights are infringed in order to create a sense of security, the infringement must be as limited as possible and the rights of those affected must be reinforced. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen at the moment and, therefore, I have voted against the motion.</p>

      <p sl="de">It is true that evaluating and processing Passenger Name Record (PNR) data at an international level can help in combating terrorism and organised crime. However, agreements of this kind often cause problems with regard to data protection. Therefore, the European Parliament must take a consistent approach on this issue (in a similar way as in the case of SWIFT), in order to protect the fundamental rights of EU citizens. There are currently a number of regulations governing the transfer of PNR data to third countries with which the EU has concluded agreements. The more countries which demand this data, the greater the risk that the different systems will have a negative impact on legal clarity, the protection of personal data and the costs for airlines. Therefore, the EU must put in place uniformly high security standards, which will guarantee a coherent approach in future. This is what I expect from an efficient EU foreign policy strategy for the transfer of PNR data. This motion for a resolution does not guarantee this and I have therefore voted against it.</p>

      <p sl="it">I endorse the objectives that the Commission proposes in its communication. The reasons that make it necessary and useful to use and exchange Passenger Name Record (PNR) data with third countries for security purposes need to be made transparent and understandable. At the same time, the parties involved need to show that they are fully aware of the implications that such actions may have on private life and of the need for them to be carried out under a set of uniform, explicit and strict data protection rules, which must be enforced even when data are transferred to other countries. The use and exchange of PNR data will not only improve people’s security, but also facilitate their lives and their movements across borders. With PNR data, police checks can be considerably reduced and surveillance can be focused on those passengers for whom there is a well-founded reason to believe that they might pose an actual risk, thus sparing the others pointless checks and inspections.</p>

      <p sl="de">On 21 September 2010, the European Commission presented its global approach to transfers of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data to third countries. The purpose of transferring and processing data, such as ticket information, seat number, luggage details, route and payment type, is to prevent, investigate, detect or prosecute criminal offences, including terrorism, within the framework of police and judicial cooperation on criminal matters. This ‘global approach’ is intended to act as a guideline for future negotiations with third countries. Negotiations with the USA, Canada and Australia will be opened shortly and other states have expressed similar intentions. The European Parliament’s motion for a resolution confirms once again the importance of the principle of proportionality. The needs of security and freedom are in a delicate balance. We are calling on the Commission to provide factual evidence that the collection, storage and processing of PNR data is necessary for each of the stated purposes and to carry out an adequate investigation into possible alternatives.

In the current climate of austerity in public budgets, of significant demographic change and of ever increasing competition at global level, Europe’s competitiveness and, above all, our future standard of living, depend on our ability to integrate innovation into products, services, companies, and social processes and models. I therefore consider it crucial that innovation has been put at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. Innovation is our best means of tackling the major social challenges that we are facing, such as climate change, energy and resource shortages, or health and ageing.

I welcome the proposed theme for this first pilot partnership: active and healthy ageing. Some of the most serious social challenges faced by Europe, such as the ageing population, require radical innovation that cuts across several sectors. Responding to ageing requires changes at all levels, from the right to work and pensions, to new service models, including self-administered care and new types of accommodation. The struggle against new risks and inequalities requires innovative approaches in the social field, not just through implementing new technology, but also through innovative organisations.

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is an integral part of the Euro-Atlantic, Eurasian security architecture with a comprehensive concept of security, including political and military, economic and environmental, and human dimensions.

This organisation has an essential role to play on a number of issues, including non-proliferation, disarmament, economic cooperation, and protection and promotion of human rights. However, the lack of a legal personality and problems with the decision-making mechanism weaken this organisation, because it is not always able to respond to crises appropriately or in a timely manner.

So far, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has shown that the way in which it performs its duties is absolutely compatible with these principles, and therefore greater involvement by the EU’s institutions in this organisation would be desirable. I also believe that taking greater responsibility may help the Member States reach common positions, thus consolidating relations among the 27 countries on these topics as well.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted to strengthen the OSCE, which must be based on harmony between the three main pillars that the organisation is founded on: political and military, economic and environmental, and human. This strengthening of the OSCE must create the framework for achieving a balance where none of these aspects is supported at the expense of the others. The effectiveness of the actions taken against security threats and challenges depends on the proper coordination and operation of these three strands. The OSCE must be a key factor in the response mainly to new threats, such as organised crime, terrorism, cyber attacks, human and drug trafficking, as well in the activities aimed at warning about, preventing and resolving conflicts. One other reason why I voted for strengthening the OSCE is the human rights aspect, involving respect for minorities’ rights and fundamental freedoms, which are key elements in the OSCE’s integrated security concept.</p>

It is essential to develop synergies between the EU and the OSCE to achieve these common aims. The OSCE is the only organisation lacking an international legal personality that intervenes on security issues in the European region. In that respect, it is more important than ever to strengthen the existing OSCE structure so as to ensure fruitful collaboration with European institutions, particularly following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in view of the forthcoming creation of the European External Action Service.

      <p sl="de">For some years, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was founded during the cold war as an institution for monitoring and confidence building purposes, has been undergoing an identity crisis. According to critics, the organisation is not equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century, such as the global financial crisis and environmental issues, including climate change. In theory, the three main players in the OSCE are the USA, Russia and the EU. Even though the situation has improved slightly under the influence of the new president, American foreign policy has very little interest in multilateral organisations. Russia appears to have equally little interest and sees the expansion of the EU and NATO as an intrusion in its historic sphere of influence. As a result, it is understandable that Moscow is calling for the OSCE to take a new direction and to shift its focus from human rights and the process of democratisation to establishing a European security structure. Russia is essential to the EU, not only because of its supply of energy, but also as a strategic partner. If the EU wants to change its role in the OSCE, it must become a counterpole to the USA, rather than a powerless paymaster. Ultimately, a sensitive approach will be needed not only in relation to Russia, but in relation to all the Eurasian states which are represented in the OSCE but who are not members of the EU.

It is also important not to underestimate the human dimension of OSCE cooperation. As well as its political and military dimension, the OSCE also plays a crucial role in promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The EU must also play an important role in this field. The coordination of EU and OSCE activities in the field of human rights is a common interest we all share. Let us not forget the circumstances in which the OSCE was established. This year marks the 35th anniversary of the inaugural conference of the OSCE and the Helsinki Final Act, when the foundations of this organisation were laid. This event symbolised a moral and political commitment to the principles of democracy and human rights. It is regrettable that this spirit of Helsinki has dimmed in recent years. This must change.

      <p sl="sk">History teaches us that armed conflicts are an outcome of the inability of the combatants to talk about contentious issues and find compromise solutions. The OSCE represents a forum for seeking such solutions.

I am therefore in favour of strengthening the OSCE, particularly in relation to the spreading of democracy and compliance with human rights. The OSCE monitoring and field missions are an important part of the expansion of the free world. However, from an EU perspective, some activities are being duplicated here. If we are talking about strengthening the OSCE, we should, at the same time, think about the extent to which the OSCE can replace the activities of EU representatives in various conflict regions. Also, as we are praising the work of the OSCE in the area of human rights, this opens up the possibility of discussing the extent to which the roles of the OSCE and the Council of Europe overlap. The aim of this discussion should be to achieve higher efficiency in the spending of public funds, which, in a time of cost cutting, is undoubtedly a priority for our voters.</p>

Decisions need to be taken urgently, especially at a time when the availability of jobs for young people and the sustainability of pension systems for older people are at risk. Solidarity between generations is needed to enable the contributions of both generations to be optimised. The only way that this will be possible is by guaranteeing free and equal access to jobs, lifelong training and career progression for all ages. That will be possible, firstly, through ensuring that young people are guaranteed jobs and, secondly, through making good use of the contribution that older people can still make to society, notably in terms of voluntary work and of their continuing to work beyond the established retirement age.</p>

For these reasons, I agree that an open debate is required to discuss various immigration policies.

      <p sl="fr">According to the Commission’s estimates, demographic changes are in danger of profoundly altering population structure and age groups. Thus, the number of young people aged 0 to 14 would drop from 100 million to 66 million in 2050. As for the population of working age, it would peak at 331 million around 2010 and would then decrease regularly to around 268 million in 2050. Faced with this situation, the EU must provide a suitable solution in order to protect employment among older people, but also among young people. I voted for this initiative report by the European Parliament which calls on Member States to think about the possibility of scrapping legal retirement ages but which also provides the broad outlines of a policy enabling us to fight against discrimination, to set lifelong learning as a goal, to promote a reflection on new ways of organising work within businesses – particularly with a view to reducing stress.

The Member States possess the main instruments for ensuring balance between the generations and ending unfair discrimination. Where there is insufficient monitoring of pension systems, national budgets, healthcare, education and employment policy, structural reforms should be carried out and new sustainable solutions found.

Nevertheless, I voted against the resolution because certain paragraphs were unacceptable, in particular, those regarding pensions. Fortunately, the paragraph explicitly mentioning the need to replace the pay-as-you-go system with capital-funded systems was rejected by a large majority in this House. However, another paragraph, which calls on ‘Member States to look again at the feasibility of scrapping compulsory retirement ages’, was adopted. That is truly unthinkable! Yes, there must be more flexibility in the pensions system, but the retirement age must remain a fundamental pillar of it!

However, I did not support the European Parliament rapporteur’s opinion that early retirement should be eliminated. Actually, very often, elderly people are forced to take early retirement because of certain circumstances, not as a matter of choice. Given the consequences of the economic crisis, the opportunity to take early retirement is often the only chance of survival for elderly people who have been made redundant. Therefore, given the fact that national pension systems differ between the Member States, we must take into account the practice in all Member States, and not follow the example of one or just a few countries. The Member States themselves must reach a decision on the implementation of early retirement provisions, taking into account their country’s situation and practice. Once again, I would like to draw attention to the fact that both demographic changes and age discrimination are undermining intergenerational solidarity and economic growth. Such discrimination severely constrains access to the labour market for both older and younger workers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In recent years, EU Member States, faced with a dramatic decline in the birth rate, have had to cope with an increasingly ageing population. The rise in life expectancy is a positive development, keeping people physically and mentally active for longer. In these circumstances, it is becoming clear that we need to face the prospect of the situation becoming even more serious, resulting in a demographic imbalance which will have its impact on Member States’ economies and budget resources, a development which has repercussions as well for the EU as a whole. Therefore, we are facing the possibility of future generations bearing the financial burden for these demographic changes. This situation makes the Lisbon objective of having half the population aged between 55 and 64 in employment absolutely essential, even if it has been missed this year. To counter this phenomenon, swift and decisive measures must be taken, in a lifecycle-orientated approach, to bring young and older people into the labour market. The proportion of people out of work in the 15-24 age group is considerably higher than that for any other age group in the EU.

I also believe the time has come for the European Union and the Member States to examine the new questions posed by the generational challenge. Europe will soon, in fact, be facing real problems due to its low demographic growth, and suitable policies need to be adopted straight away so as not to jeopardise the entire European social security system. In this respect, I think it is essential to re-evaluate social policy in favour of the over-sixties. People in this age group bring added value to the world of work, and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more.

I agree with the rapporteur’s view that older people are not a burden for the economy and society but, on the contrary, a great benefit because of their experience of life and their knowledge.

Although the main instruments for promoting justice between generations fall under the jurisdiction of the Member States, the EU plays a crucial role in terms of surveillance, monitoring the correct and effective implementation of Union anti-discrimination legislation, and in terms of promoting the exchange of best practices and action plans. It is essential for the EU and the Member States to promote new initiatives for active, healthy and dignified ageing.

We are well aware that the assurances we enjoyed in the past cannot be guaranteed for the future, and we have to be ready to form a society that is still able to prosper in circumstances that are no longer the same as in the present or past.

      <p sl="pt">Equality and solidarity between generations within the European Union are becoming one of the most important challenges for European social policy in the coming decades. Overall, therefore, I am voting in favour of the measures proposed in this report. There must be a shift in paradigm with regard to how societies and economies view the ageing of the population. Instead of seeing them as a burden and synonymous with increased costs, their experience and knowledge mean that older people should be seen as a valuable asset in business culture. To this end, businesses should be encouraged to develop age-management strategies, which would increase their competitiveness by making use of the experience and specific qualities of their older workers. I also believe that the ageing of the population provides an important opportunity to improve competitiveness and encourage potential innovation, thereby promoting growth and creating jobs. Finally, I should like to express my concern about the high rate of youth unemployment in the EU, and the need to create more jobs and establish long-term prospects that enable them to ensure their full participation in society.</p>

      <p sl="it">Justice in relations between generations represents the new global challenge that needs to be adequately tackled. Modern societies have found themselves presiding over a period of constant growth in which, above all in the last few decades, new generations have had better conditions and prospects ahead of them than previous generations. Now, the situation has surpassed the limits of seemingly endless growth and we find ourselves faced with a debate between rights and limited resources. All countries, beginning with the developed and democratic ones and their related organisations (like the EU), must therefore work determinedly, conclusively and cogently to work out policies, make choices and implement them coherently for a greater equilibrium between current and future generations, so that the division and distance between those with rights and those without, and those with resources and those without, may be reduced. It seems to me that the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations that we have voted on works along these lines.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this report, which makes a number of important proposals to tackle the demographic challenges we face in a spirit of solidarity between generations. Insufficient welfare provisions, inadequate social services and high levels of youth unemployment contribute to late marriage and childbirth, thus accelerating the ageing of our populations. Both the young and the elderly experience different forms of age discrimination, particularly as regards access to the labour market and certain social services. While Member States control key instruments such as national budgets, pension and healthcare services, the EU can further the reach of anti-discrimination legislation, particularly to protect older women in the labour market. Moreover, women of all ages often care for young and elderly dependents. Their work is, in itself, an example of intergenerational support and needs socio-economic recognition, although not as a substitute to the development of quality care services. As atypical and precarious forms of work become increasingly common, the right to a decent pension at the age of retirement is threatened. This trend can only be countered by economic policies focused on growth, respect for workers’ rights and the provision of quality public services.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As I have said previously, European society is ageing, which is often seen as a negative in economic analysis. Naturally, the inversion of the demographic pyramid in countries where the welfare state is still strong means that there are ever fewer people contributing to the social assistance system and ever more people dependent on it. In very blunt terms, more older people means increased spending on pensions and health. However, a society of solidarity cannot look at ageing in this way. It is essential to create active ageing solutions and ways to make use of the immense human potential of older people, who, even in a competitive market like Europe’s, still represent an added value because of their greater experience and knowledge. At the other end of the scale, we cannot talk about an ageing population without talking about birth policies that encourage the birth of children in the European Union. The average birth rate in the EU is 1.5 children, one of the lowest in the world; this can only be reversed with robust policies in support of families, which do not penalise men and women who decide to have children, in economic, tax and professional terms.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This is a report full of contradictions. On the one hand, it uses very complimentary language about older people. On the other hand, however, it puts forward basic measures that, in practice, put the rights of older people and of workers in general at risk. Some examples of this are:</p>
      <p sl="pt">encouraging private pension systems, thus prioritising the financial sector and forgetting the serious consequences that these practices have already had, notably in the United States, where they left millions of pensioners destitute, forcing the state to intervene;</p>
      <p sl="pt">encouraging state intervention to increase part-time work and flexible work, brushing aside the consequences of these practices, such as the devaluing of labour, low wages, precarious work, and increased numbers of workers with incomes below the poverty line;</p>

Tomorrow’s workforce will be made up of today’s young people. If they put off entering the labour market, it will mean delayed careers, lower wages and a pay gap compared with the other generations.

In every country, including France, studies show that this is not the case, not only when it comes to demographics, but also in terms of finance. Even Mrs Tribalat, a French demographer that could hardly be accused of being sympathetic to the National Front, has come to the same conclusion. I am well aware that in this House, we like to believe that, according to the SOS Racisme slogan, ‘Mohamed will pay for Maurice’s pension’ … as well as that of Karl, Matthew and Juan. Yet that is not true, anywhere. Mr Mann should also be careful when he recommends replacing our pay-as-you-go systems with capital-funded systems. Given the current backdrop of the world financial crisis, this is the type of proposal that could bring ruin to our elderly people, with the likes of Madoff being the only ones to benefit.</p>

Moreover, I preferred to abstain during the vote on this report.

However, the text also contains many recommendations concerning pension systems that I cannot endorse. Among other things, the text invites states to scrap the legal retirement age, and lays great stress upon the need to reduce the burden of the public debt, which is tantamount to encouraging privately funded pension systems that are particularly unfair.

I agree with the rapporteur’s view that older people are not a burden for the economy and society but, on the contrary, a great benefit because of their experience, their life’s work and their knowledge. In this regard, I agree with the rapporteur, who is proposing concrete measures for establishing a basis for open dialogue, and calling on the Commission and the Council to introduce an intergenerational balance in all Member States and at EU level.</p>

I have voted in favour of the Mann report because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament. However, I very much oppose the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous than comparable private sector pensions. In addition, I am opposed to private sector pension funds playing a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions.

I therefore appreciate and draw attention to the space devoted to balancing family life with work and private life, in particular, the space and the role attributed to women, including older women, in applying the principle of justice between generations.

On the other hand, if we look at it in terms of the future of our pension schemes, an ageing population causes a real headache to political decision makers and to advocates of balanced budgets. If we add to this the low birth rate in many of the 27 Member States, intergenerational solidarity is akin to Proust’s Madeleine with European societies remembering things past. To paraphrase Mr Mann’s excellent report: Europe must rise to the demographic challenge, and Jean Bodin’s famous formula: ‘the only wealth is man’ now makes perfect sense. To maintain a fair society, one that works in solidarity, in other words, one in which we refuse to burden future generations with our public debts and in which balance between the number of pensioners and the active population is favoured, there is only one solution. It will inevitably require action using a number of approaches: job and retirement flexibility, a humanist and realistic immigration policy, and clear complementarities between the pay-as-you-go and capital-funded financing systems, the reason why the MR delegation voted against paragraph 99 on this last matter.</p>

As it is to be expected that the retirement age will be increased, working conditions for older people should be adapted and made more attractive. Older employees should be given better opportunities for participating in the labour market. A new approach is also needed in society to ensure that older people are no longer discriminated against because of their reduced capabilities, for example.

The development that has taken place in the European Union and its various Member States over recent decades has brought changes and consequences which are socially evident and which require support from the European institutions. The concept of development is inevitably associated with economic, social and cultural matters, to the extent that these sectors cannot be separated when one refers to the process of globalisation and development. In this context, the work of the European institutions should contain and provide support for this inequality, which causes a lack of social cohesion. This common ideal would result in greater social cohesion, less economic inequality and a balanced individual and collective development of society. Development and social cohesion must not be enemies of progress but an integral part of it for more robust integration and coexistence in society.

      <p sl="de">I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between the generations, because the recommendation to change the way in which pensions are financed in the original report was not adopted by the European Parliament. I am very much opposed to the requirement to encourage private pension provision and to ensure that, on average, public sector pensions are no more generous, both in terms of contributions and benefits, than comparable private sector pensions. In addition, private sector pension funds should not play a more important role in diminishing the future burden of providing state pensions. The pay-as-you-go system must not, under any circumstances, be replaced by capital-funded systems. In my opinion, the pay-as-you-go system is the most economically sensible and sustainable system. However, I have voted against the passage in the resolution which calls on the Member States ‘to give consideration to regulated labour migration (immigration from third countries into the EU)’. In my opinion, this wording implies a positive assessment of labour migration from third countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">We Greens have supported the text because paragraph 99 (on private/capital-funded systems) was deleted, and because the rest of the text has taken some positive Green points on board. For instance, measures concerning the retirement age should be based on the needs of the persons concerned; periods spent working, learning, caring or volunteering are complementary and provide valuable experience at all ages; there is a need to combat age discrimination and to set country specific targets for access to training and lifelong learning for older workers, broken down by age group and gender. Older people’s employability also depends on autonomy and individual choice for workers and a better work-life balance. In order to avoid a disproportionate burden on women because of an increased demand for care in an ageing society, labour and care should be rendered compatible in all Member States and equally distributed between women and men.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is a fact that the whole of Europe is facing demographic changes, which include the ageing of society, low birth rates, population migrations from poorer countries to wealthier ones, longer life expectancies, delays in entering the labour market, the growing number of one-person households and households without children, etc. This all combines to create the enormous need for change which the new demographic challenges and the growing role of bringing generations together impose on us. It has become essential to introduce a well thought out system of intergenerational accounting, along with reform of the system of social care and the taxation system in Europe, including pension systems, guarantees of appropriate care for the older generation and avoidance of the process which is creating the growing debt of the younger generations. Therefore, it is essential to reform the Stability and Growth Pact, so that Member States can meet their obligations to make their pension systems more stable.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Mann’s report on the demographic challenge and solidarity between generations sheds light on the challenges raised by demographic change, in particular, unemployment and job insecurity, education and discrimination affecting vulnerable groups. It highlights the need for intergenerational solidarity and puts forward some pertinent suggestions, namely, an initiative regarding a European 50-plus pact which includes combating age discrimination, the objective of full employment up to the legal retirement age and helping to reintegrate older disabled people. The reason why I abstained from the final vote when this report was more than satisfactory is because paragraph 24, which wants to scrap compulsory retirement ages, has been maintained. The fact is, if we have no safeguards enabling our senior citizens to take their retirement, we can no longer guarantee them a good end to their life. I refuse to see our older people working up to their death as we saw in the 19th century.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Solidarity is one of the values governing the European Union, so realising it in terms of equality between generations is essential. The Member States are facing a series of demographic and social challenges that make it necessary to establish solidarity between generations. Increased life expectancy and the decreased birth rate will have terrible consequences for European social systems if specific measures cannot be taken.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given the current situation, the European Parliament believes in the need to initiate a dialogue aimed at intergenerational relationships. The report cuts across many sectors, going from education to employment with regard to both old and young people, to health policy and welfare payments, to family and birth rate policy, and even to the development of welfare systems, culminating in migration policies to solve the problems of an ageing society.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, the report duly notes that steadily decreasing populations in the European Union and the continuing tendency of low birth rates are creating numerous challenges for Europe’s economy and society. For these reasons, the EU labour market will experience mostly negative structural changes. In Lithuania, these demographic problems are further compounded by the mass exodus of Lithuania’s young people to work abroad. We are a small nation and we are rapidly losing our most active 25-40 year olds, in whose upbringing and education much was invested. Lithuania needs these young people’s talents, experience and diligence to overcome the demographic challenges mentioned. I therefore support the European Youth Guarantee initiative proposed by the rapporteur, according to which all young people in the EU would be offered a job, an apprenticeship or additional training following a period of six months’ unemployment. More should also be done to increase birth rates: accessible high quality childcare, education and mentoring for young children is the first step in the right direction. We must also stop the social exclusion of elderly people. We must persuade our economy and society that the elderly are not a burden. Their experience, achievements and wealth of knowledge can be useful for all generations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Above all, elderly people must be entitled to a decent pension, enabling them to live life with dignity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, it is mainly early retirement schemes that are used to make arrangements to meet the needs of workers nearing the end of their career and yet, quite simply, Mr Mann wants to dismantle them.</p>

      <p sl="de">As always, Mr Mann has done a very good job on a sensitive subject. As a result, I was able to vote in favour of the report. I would like briefly to add another aspect to the discussion. As a Member of the European Parliament from Saxony, a region which is hard hit by demographic change, and as a Member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and rapporteur of the own-initiative report on future innovation policy in the EU, I would like to say that at EU level and, above all, in the Member States, we must, of course, continue to combat demographic change and make the regions more attractive for young people, in particular, by increasing economic growth, creating jobs and developing a tailor-made education policy. However, I would also like to emphasise the special importance of older workers in SMEs with regard to innovation. The EU has finally recognised that, in particular in SMEs, it is not only new technological inventions which are innovative, but also, for example, the ability to adapt a product to meet a customer’s specific circumstances or improve service processes. Particularly in this area, it is older employees who have a wealth of experience and can make a company innovative. For this reason, we must combat age discrimination in the workplace. The EU and the Member States must take this into consideration in all their social and labour legislation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Let us not become confused over terminology – the report we have adopted is more about finding new labour resources than about solidarity. The demographic crisis is not something we found out about yesterday. Some of us have been drawing attention to it for a very long time. For years, we have been saying that Europe is ageing and dying. Now it is upon us and we are frantically looking for a solution. Cold logic offers us many. Putting back the retirement age, increasing the birth rate, bringing more women into the sphere of formal employment, and increasing the influx of immigrants and integrating them into our society. We are willing to do all of these, and the submitted report talks about all of these. However, I am not entirely sure it will help – and if so, for how long. This is because we are addressing not the cause, but the consequences. We are behaving like participants in a pyramid scheme, who see that the base of the pyramid is starting to stagnate. We are looking for new players to expand the base. However, by deliberately giving a new meaning to words like ‘solidarity’ or ‘work-life balance’, we are destroying genuine solidarity and taking children away from their parents. Despite this, I voted in favour of the submitted report. I see it as an important contribution to the fundamental debate on the survival of European civilisation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Research and development are two major challenges for the future of the European Union in the current global context. I therefore supported the European Parliament’s initiative aimed at simplifying the implementation of the European Union’s framework programmes for research. My fellow Members and I have thus estimated that the European Commission communication on simplifying the implementation of research framework programmes proposes serious and creative measures aimed at removing the obstacles encountered by participants in the framework programmes. This is about boosting the trust that European funding has in the candidates and about making them more risk-tolerant in relation to participants at all stages of the projects, with flexible European rules. The resolution reflects the fact that the current system is excessively control-oriented, which results in wasted resources and in low participation. Finally, we welcome the overall trend towards shortening the average time-to-grant and time-to-pay in spite of further progress that can still be achieved.</p>

Red tape and onerous administrative and regulatory conditions add to the complexity of the application process and contribute to the difficulty faced by small organisations and by small and medium-sized enterprises trying to get funding for the research in which they are engaged. Since the research community itself is asking that the rules be adjusted, the procedures and requirements simplified, and more trust placed in EU research funding, it is quite clear now that there is a need to streamline the funding and administration of research to ensure that research and innovation are effective and widespread across Europe. This simplification and effectiveness would positively affect the research situation in the EU, and would be beneficial for stakeholders as well.

Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services. These will create new sources of employment and growth, something that will both render Europe more competitive and improve its quality of life. For some time, the research community has expressed concern that the implementation of research programmes and the development of innovations is not proceeding as swiftly as hoped because of particularly complex bureaucratic requirements. This is a particular problem for smaller organisations, such as SMEs, high tech start ups and smaller institutes, universities and research centres. There is a real demand for improvement and streamlining of research funding and administration. At present, there are different rules and procedures for different instruments of the framework programme, and this severely impedes stakeholders’ opportunities to submit applications. I agree that in debating the Eighth Framework Programme for research, most attention should be paid to the simplification of administrative procedures to ensure uniform interpretation and application of rules and procedures used in all programmes and instruments.</p>

In these circumstances, the increase in red tape associated with accessing the funding for those involved in research and innovation programmes will only help dampen and reduce the enthusiasm of those participants who are already showing signs that they have started to lose confidence in this process. The current system should be replaced by a system which inspires more confidence in applicants. One positive step would be to simplify the process for monitoring projects’ financial and administrative aspects, while also consolidating the scientific and technological assessment process. It should be possible, to start with, to simplify the administrative control process, which will inspire greater confidence in the scientific and business communities.

      <p sl="it">I offer my congratulations on the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mrs Carvalho. I am firmly convinced that science, innovation and research are the main drivers of economic growth and job creation in Europe. It is no accident that research and innovation lie at the heart of the Europe 2020 initiative. It is therefore time for Europe to invest more in these areas: to compete on the world stage, the European Union must develop innovative products and modern services. As a result, the number of applications for funding is increasing on a daily basis, meaning that a general simplification of the financial accountability requirements is needed, together with harmonisation of the currently highly diverse rules and procedures. I voted in favour because I agree that we need to respond swiftly to the research community, which has been clamouring for these changes. I endorse the approach taken by the rapporteur of basing the funding system not on results, which may lower the scientific ambition of researchers, but on scientific criteria and, hence, on excellence. Administrative simplification is one of the major priorities that Europe must address, and greater internationalisation of the framework programme may create new opportunities and possibilities for cooperation with third countries, including developing countries.</p>

In future, the simplification process may be extended to other European programmes, notably the Structural Funds. Programmes which have simpler rules will also be more transparent and more efficient. I would also like to thank my colleagues, Mr Cerexhe of the Belgian Presidency, Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, and all those who contributed to the public consultation for their assistance.

      <p sl="pt">Research and development are crucially important to achieving the goals to which the European Union has committed itself under the Europe 2020 strategy. European programmes in the field of research and innovation have been increasing significantly in recent years, both in terms of applications made to them and in terms of their budgetary allocation. However, it is difficult for small and medium-sized organisations to handle the complexity and bureaucracy inherent to these programmes. Accessing the programmes and preparing proposals are still very difficult, especially for those new to them; the administrative burdens for administering projects and accounting are considered too high; and the average time between the awarding of the subsidy and payment remains too long. The mechanisms involved in the research framework programmes therefore urgently need to be updated and simplified, in order to simplify the monitoring of the projects’ financial and administrative aspects while reinforcing the process of scientific and technological evaluation I welcome the European Commission’s initiative to reverse this status quo , and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Carvalho, on the excellent work she has done in proposing concrete measures to improve the current system.</p>

That, however, is not enough at a time of intense international competition like the present. It is always necessary, in fact, to monitor results, assess the feasibility of opportunities and maintain close relations with the scientific community, which renders society an enormous service. Cutting down on red tape and thereby streamlining tendering procedures would allow researchers to focus on their own professional goals, through the use of resources and skills that would otherwise be wasted. We should not forget that these funds are paid out to be used efficiently. While merit is an essential component of efficiency, it is unacceptable that research should be hindered because researchers have to deal with bureaucratic requirements of doubtful value.</p>

      <p sl="ro">My vote in favour of this report is based on three factors. The first is the connection with my previous activities. I mentioned the particular attention focused by citizens on research in the field of early detection and prevention of cancer. It has become obvious that research is vital for improving people’s lives, provided, however, that there is a visible link. I therefore considered that this report, aimed at simplifying the way in which funds are granted for research, development and innovation via the Seventh Framework Programme, deserves to be supported. The second factor relates to the importance I personally attach to SMEs as key components in economic development and the development of the European Union’s global competitiveness. The report’s provisions on providing access to information and facilitating the involvement of SMEs by developing the ‘one face to the customer approach’ and the Open Access Pilot, and on running information campaigns, made me welcome this report and give it my vote. Last but not least, I welcomed the contributions regarding the future Eighth Framework Programme, which must be more transparent, flexible and easily accessible. The proposals made in the report on how to simplify, explain and assess the results are commendable.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is essential to simplify access to the framework research programmes in order for there to be motivation for potential interested parties to access them and for important funds not to be squandered. We cannot forget that research makes a vital contribution to economic growth, to job creation, and to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy. It is therefore time to coordinate national, regional and European research policies, so that there are not considerable obstacles to obtaining cost-effective solutions. That being the case, we need to move towards greater simplification and harmonisation of rules and procedures, as simplification is not just an isolated objective, but is rather a means of ensuring the attractiveness and accessibility of EU research funding.</p>

      <p sl="fr">There is increasing despondency among researchers, research institutes, universities and businesses with the research framework programmes due to the complex nature of the European Commission’s tendering procedure. However, the 2020 strategy aims to improve the framework conditions and access to funding for research and innovation to ensure that innovative ideas can be turned into goods and services creating growth and jobs. Therefore, in the interests of efficiency and with a view to promoting the highest quality research, it was highly desirable to simplify the implementation of the research framework programmes. We had to take these measures to remain attractive in order to attract and keep the best scientists in Europe and remain competitive in a global economy.

      <p sl="lv">I agree that we must simplify the funding of these programmes, but on one condition – after the result has been achieved, it must be available free of charge to all EU countries. Otherwise, what will happen is this – one EU nation will carry out the research project with EU Structural Fund money, with common EU resources, therefore, but then, after it has obtained the result – be it a new product or new technology, it will sell it to other EU Member States. This is unacceptable. It is important that all who provide funding should be able to dispose of the results of research projects carried out with common EU funds free of charge.</p>

      <p sl="de">During the economic crisis which developed out of the financial crisis, between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion from the EU budget was redeployed to energy projects from other subsidy funds which still had money available in order to aid the recovery of the economy. As the Commission explained in its presentation of the 2020 energy strategy, an investment of EUR 1 trillion is needed to develop the outdated power grid in Europe over the next few years. It is to be expected that consumers will have to pay the cost of this, rather than the energy sector. An important factor in this respect will be energy research, providing that it focuses on the genuinely more cost-effective technologies. We must bring an end to the emphasis on nuclear power which, in addition to posing the risk of environmental catastrophes, is by no means cost-effective when the cost of expensive terminal storage, a problem which has not yet been resolved, is included.

      <p sl="it">We live in a global economy, where competition is no longer represented by local, national or European businesses. Our businesses, researchers, scientists and universities all find themselves having to compete on a global level with markets that have enormous amounts of resources available to them, often with very much lower costs than our own. Therefore, we need to invest more in innovation and research and less in largely unskilled manual labour, as our costs will never be competitive with those of the new economic powers. We need to create new, high level positions, promote sustainable mobility, improve education and technical skills and coordinate them with the needs of the labour market. I hope that the next framework programme makes all necessary resources available to ensure that the European Union is a leading light in this sector, that it is always at the cutting edge, and that it is able to attract resources and human capital.

      <p sl="ro">Science, education and innovation are pillars of economic growth and job creation. Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services. Research and innovation are at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, it is particularly difficult for smaller organisations – SMEs, high-tech start-ups and smaller institutes, universities and research centres – to cope with the procedural complexity involved in accessing the funds earmarked for this sector. The scientific community is urgently calling for harmonisation of the rules and procedures and for a general simplification of the financial accountability requirements. Recently, 13 000 researchers put their names to a petition requesting greater simplification and trust in EU research funding. It is certainly necessary to simplify the mechanisms involved in the framework programmes for research, technological development and demonstration activities, FP7 and FP8 and all the European Commission science and innovation programmes.</p>

      <p sl="es">Since 1984, the successive framework programmes for research and technological development have evolved considerably, while growing in terms of both budget and the number of areas covered, which is certainly a positive thing. They have also done so, however, at the cost of such complexity in the rules for participation that the cooperation of our best researchers is at serious risk. The report covers the demands of the scientific community in a comprehensive and exemplary manner, along with the conclusions of the seminar on simplification organised by the Spanish Presidency in February. This is why I have voted in favour of a report that consolidates a series of principles and lines of action such as closely linking this matter with the future of the financial perspectives after 2013, the tri-annual review of the Financial Regulation and the application of tolerable risk of error in the area of research, all of which will be fundamental for preparing the Eighth Framework Programme. There is, however, also another series of less significant simplification measures that we can introduce into the current framework programme by way of good practice that will not only facilitate the participation of the current beneficiaries, but which I am convinced will also strengthen that participation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on simplifying the implementation of the research framework programmes. Without simplification of the administrative formalities for the tendering and implementation procedure, there will be no growth in participation of the private sector in the framework programmes. Taking into account the key criterion for evaluation – the cooperation of industry with science – projects which do not include the participation of partners from the small and medium-sized enterprise sector have a poor chance of being undertaken.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In addition, one of the most commonly occurring problems is the selection of foreign partners for projects. Greater help from the Commission is still essential here. The most important barrier to building an innovative economy is the fact that people do not know of the existence of the Seventh Framework Programme – or that they are afraid of it. The complicated procedures are making many institutions concentrate mainly on obtaining support from structural funds. The current achievements of Polish groups (according to the evaluation of the Polish National Contact Point on the basis of data supplied by the European Commission) are not very satisfactory. The success rate for the participation of Polish groups is 18.56%, while for subsidies granted, it is 13.72%, compared to the EU average of 22.28% and 20.56% respectively. This is a great loss for Polish science, which has at its disposal a huge research potential as well as superb scientific staff. Better use should be made of the opportunity presented by FP7. Simplifications in the implementation of FP7 will contribute to an increase in the innovativeness and competitiveness of the EU economy in the global economic arena.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, we are voting on an important document about simplifying procedures for accessing framework programmes for research and innovation. Simplifying and standardising the legislative framework of European research programmes is a choice we have to make. Indeed, science, education and innovation are the foundations for economic revitalisation and the creation of new jobs. We need to invest in research and innovation if we want to focus on new products and services to make Europe more competitive and, at the same time, improve European citizens’ quality of life. Over recent years, the European research and innovation programmes have become notably broader in scope. This has also brought an increase in rules and administrative procedures which, in turn, have caused greater difficulties in participating in European tenders. Through this document, we are urging the European Commission to remove these obstacles and urgently begin simplifying the rules for accessing research funding. I voted in favour of the resolution, hoping for greater procedural uniformity in order to allow easier and more open access to European funding, which often remains largely unused, partly because of procedural difficulties.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Ladies and gentlemen, there cannot be innovations without research competence. Innovation linked to cutting edge science and education is one of the engines of job creation and economic growth. Europe must invest in innovation if it is to develop new products and services. Therefore, as the rapporteur rightly observes, it is important for us to help simplify the mechanisms involved in the framework programmes for research. The coordination of rules and procedures and the simplification of research funding and administration are long overdue. It is difficult for the majority of smaller organisations (high tech start ups or universities and research centres) to cope with the complexity of the current rules. According to this year’s European Innovation Scoreboard, which compares the innovation performance of all EU Member States, Lithuania’s rates are below the EU-27 average. However, it demonstrated good progress and has great potential – Lithuania has one of the fastest Internet connections and one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the world. Therefore, it is very important to continue to invest in the development of technologies and improve the implementation of national and European digital agendas. This will make Europe more competitive and will improve quality of life.</p>

She highlights a number of areas for improvement with regard to simplifying the administrative processes. I was happy to vote in favour of this report. I would like to add one brief point which I often hear about from small and medium-sized companies in the area which I represent, and that is the language issue. Many companies which are entitled to apply for European subsidies and whose ideas will bring added value on a European scale do not have the necessary language skills to go through the application process in English. In the Seventh Framework Programme guidelines, under the heading ‘Tips for a successful application’ the following text appears: ‘Although it is possible to submit an application in any of the official EU languages, applications should always be submitted in English’. This means that a project with an application which is not in English does not have a chance, even if, for example, the common working language of the group of companies in question is not English. In order to reduce the administrative work involved for the companies at which these subsidy programmes are aimed, the EU Commission should change the way in which the project applications are examined by their experts, so that at least during the initial stage, the project documentation can be submitted in one of the Commission’s three working languages.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I voted in favour of the report because we cannot weigh down our top facilities with an unsustainable administrative burden if we want our support for European research to be effective. However, the text of the resolution and the debate on it have again confirmed my belief that public funds should be used to secure basic public services; other activities, including research and entrepreneurial activities, should be financed from private sources. The role of this Parliament should be limited to two areas. The first is the creation of a basic legislative framework to facilitate this type of business. If we are asking in the resolution today for a simplification of the mechanisms and instruments used in the current system of public grants, we are solving the result and not the cause of the problem. This is because public grants are the problem. The second area is respect for the rights of EU Member States. If some states ban the use of human embryos for research purposes, such research should not be financed from the common resources of the EU. It is like taking money from a committed non-smoker and using it to subsidise tobacco cultivation. I am in favour of simplifying support for research. It seems to me that we should aim to create a favourable environment for those who want to invest in new technologies and innovations, rather than discussing eligible costs and accounting procedures.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because livestock farming is going through an extremely difficult time as a result of increased animal feed prices. We are probably on the way to another commodities bubble. Prices on the international market have already increased by more than 16% on average since June. Never has there been so much negotiating on the futures market, nor has there been so much money involved. Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts, without any contact with the real economy. The figures for the largest cereals exchange in the world, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are impressive. Transaction records are being broken in purchases of soya, maize and wheat. The practical result is the transfer of these increases to real market prices, even in a year when cereals are widely available. These increases in animal feed prices are causing terrible damage to the already difficult situation of many of our livestock farms, which will be unable to pass on the increases in what they sell because of the crisis and are unlikely to be able to absorb them.</p>

European producers must comply with the most stringent regulations in terms of food safety and quality, the environment, animal health and welfare and labour conditions, which adds significantly to producers’ costs, leaving them at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis third country producers. The livestock sector in the EU is facing serious problems, including the rising costs of inputs, such as fuel and fertilisers, the high cost of complying with EU regulations, greater competition from third country imports and the low prices being received by producers for meat products. To protect European producers and this important sector of the economy, the European Commission must ensure that the post-2013 CAP is adequately financed, in order to guarantee the viability of all EU farmers, including livestock farmers, and that the conditions exist for fair competition.</p>

I believe that market instruments must guarantee an appropriate supply of cereals for providing animal feed. In this regard, the European Commission should propose flexible market mechanisms for providing a swifter response. In my view, it is important for the European Union to have an instrument for assessing market trends globally. The new European External Action Service could provide an extremely suitable instrument capable of helping anticipate strategic changes in third countries and promote the European agricultural model all over the world.

      <p sl="it">The market economy model developed in Europe over the decades should make us proud. With regard to the primary sector, the transition in many regions from an economy based primarily on arable and livestock farming to one based essentially on services has been correctly managed. The management of this transition has been underpinned by public intervention designed to ensure income stability for companies and to exclude food prices from the pressures of competition. Many lives can be saved, and a marked saving made in healthcare spending, through the adoption of healthy, balanced diets. The statistics also bring new issues to everyone’s attention. I am referring to the safeguarding of food supplies, a factor to which everything else is inevitably connected, and to the quality and balance of the foods that will be available on the market in the coming years. I must mention the incomes of the thousands of families who live off the proceeds of these activities subsidised by the EU.

      <p sl="ro">Food market trends in recent years have been characterised by a series of paradoxes. One of these is that, while shelf food prices have been rising, farmers, including livestock farmers in the EU, are facing an income crisis which is threatening the existence of their farms and reducing them to poverty. We must be aware that the high quality standards imposed on livestock farmers come at a cost. In the case where competition from imports from third countries, which do not impose the same high standards, is not kept under control – let me remind you of the incident involving the milk powder from China infected with melamine – these costs will cause a drop in EU production in this area. Inadequate gestures are being made for the livestock farmers’ benefit. This is why the Commission’s intention to release a quantity of feed cereal is just one step aimed at helping the sector which must be followed by others as well. Consequently, I believe that the recommendations contained in the resolution, if adopted by the Commission and applied, will meet the demands of livestock farmers.

This is why the European Union – including through the common agricultural policy, above all, in its post-2013, reformed incarnation – and each Member State must promote its continued existence, not only by coming up with innovative techniques for farming and economically and environmentally sustainable management, but also by strengthening their wider role as guardians of the environment and the land protecting them from the market crisis by reducing production costs, making the best of their products and greater organisation on the market. It seems to me that the report on the crisis in the EU livestock sector that we have voted on works along these lines.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The markets should be governed by the reality of stocks and needs and not by speculation; that is the message that the European Parliament wants to send to the European Commission by adopting the resolution on the crisis of livestock farming in the European Union. For Parliament, the next reform of the common agricultural policy will have to take into consideration the issue of farmers’ income, which is increasingly subject to the consequences of speculation on commodities and to distributors abusing their dominant position. Beyond the one-off response to the sharp rise in cereal prices that prompted the crisis of livestock farming, Parliament wishes to raise the issue of the place that the European Union wants European agriculture to have in the global market, namely, produce with strict standards that are imposed on our commercial partners in order to have fair competition.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As I have warned many times, the EU’s excessive regulation could quickly end up becoming a factor which exacerbates competitiveness in certain sectors, livestock being one of these. I cannot forget hearing a British farmer talking in this Chamber about the difficulties he felt when he saw that meat from his animals was unable to compete on the market, such were the requirements imposed on him by legislation. That is the risk we are running and it is well identified in this proposal. It is also clear that the sector’s crisis could result in a significant drop in meat production throughout the EU, leading not only to the disappearance of small and medium-sized producers, but also to a market supply crisis, increased prices and greater dependence on imports. I cannot forget milk production, which is an important issue for Portugal, so I would remind you that the policy of former Commissioner Fischer-Boel regarding milk quotas was severely criticised, and firmly and persistently opposed by farmers. For that very reason, I again urge the Commission to review this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The resolution that has been put to the vote acknowledges the serious crisis being experienced in the livestock sector, made worse by increased cereal prices, and calls on the Commission to table proposals for measures that could support the sector. It also calls on the Commission and Council to ensure that the common agricultural policy after 2013 will have sufficient funding to ensure the viability of all the EU’s farmers. However, by defending guidelines that caused the problems currently faced by the sector, particularly small and medium-sized producers, it shows itself to be profoundly contradictory, and even contrary to the interests of these producers. The resolution once again advocates subjecting farming and food production to competition and the free market. It also warns of the speculation on foodstuffs that has been taking place, but limits itself to calling for excessive speculation to be fought and therefore believes that speculation on foodstuffs can continue, provided that it is not excessive. For our part, we have said it before and we are saying it again: it is necessary to break with a system that sees food as if it were just another commodity and allows speculation on foodstuffs; this leads to explosive situations of food dependency and price volatility, as has been occurring.</p>

      <p sl="it">The crisis in the livestock sector has been particularly influenced by the increase in cereal crop prices (above all, in Italy and Spain, since in countries like the United Kingdom, grazing livestock is most widespread) and the consequent rise in the costs of production. The downward trend in the sector is also partly due to the volume of imports from third countries. The problems in the sector could put food safety in the EU and provisions of meat for its citizens at risk. I therefore agree with the contents of this joint motion for a resolution, upon which I shall be expressing a favourable vote. In particular, I believe that we need to introduce market control mechanisms and pay greater attention to the content of the bilateral agreements concluded with third countries, such as in the recent Mercosur case.</p>

      <p sl="de">Many livestock farms in the European Union are in a difficult situation. This is primarily due to a considerable increase in the price of cereals and, consequently, of feedstuffs. For this reason, it is important for us to take measures which will help livestock farmers to emerge from this difficult period in a stronger position. In addition to the rise in the feed price, two points are particularly important to me. The first is that the high European product and safety standards which our livestock farms have to comply with must be applied to imported products that are sold in the European Union. This would help to ensure that European farmers are not at a major competitive disadvantage to producers in third countries and, at the same time, would guarantee that all the products sold in the European Union are of high quality. The second point is about making agricultural policy simpler and more transparent. Unnecessary regulations take up a lot of time and cost a lot of money. Therefore, it is important that they are removed. This would really make life easier for all the farms within the European Union. The motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development includes a number of good proposals of this kind which will bring about a permanent improvement in the situation of livestock farms. I am expecting to see these reflected in the Commission’s future activities.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am disappointed that Amendments 1 and 2 were adopted by a majority in Parliament. Despite the self-inflicted interruption in supplies, we must not allow our agricultural industry to be contaminated with GMOs. The acceptance of unauthorised GMOs and the establishment of a threshold ‘for adventitious GMOs which are not yet authorised in the European Union’, and which have not yet undergone full scientific testing, have resulted in a flood of authorisations of GMOs in the USA and, in particular, in developing countries. On account of the testing capacity in these countries, this leads to an increased risk of damage to health and the environment. Countries outside the EU now have an increasing influence over authorisation practices within the EU, with the result being an ongoing decline in the health and environmental safety levels of authorised GMOs. In addition, with regard to Amendment 3 that has been adopted, I am not of the opinion that the current ban on meat and bone meal for non-ruminants should be reviewed. This would increase not only the potential risk presented by genetic engineering in agriculture, but also the potential risk of a new outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

      <p sl="de">The current situation in the livestock sector is very difficult and some areas are unprofitable because of the high production costs. On the one hand, farmers are being paid lower prices by consumers, while on the other, they are faced with major fluctuations in feed prices. It is important for us to prevent a serious crisis occurring in the livestock sector by making immediate use of the available instruments to stabilise the market. Another factor which has an impact on European farmers is the growing competition from third countries where production costs are lower and the increasing tendency in trade policy to exchange larger quantities of food imports for services, without at least requiring the same production standards. I support the resolution which calls for specific measures to be taken on behalf of the livestock sector. I would like to thank Mrs Herranz for her initiative. Against the background of the difficult market situation and the discussion which has been initiated about the future of agricultural policy in the EU, Parliament needs to make a clear commitment to giving all areas of agricultural production the necessary security to allow them to plan for the future.</p>

Unfortunately, the crisis in this sector is now having a negative effect leading to a significant loss in revenue for producers, to which we cannot be indifferent. The very least that we should promise, and it is what producers rightly expect, is the reciprocity of these regulations on imports. When, sooner or later, food safety is a matter of global concern, Europe must react to maintain the viability of livestock farming when it is under threat. This investment in the future is vital. This is why the economic impact of the regulations required, namely, legislation on animal welfare, must be assessed and incorporated into long-term planning for the future of the agricultural sector and the livestock sector in particular.</p>

The European agricultural sector is sacrificed in favour of the possibility of the EU exporting other types of product to these countries from a great variety of economic sectors, but mainly from the livestock sector.

A modern society requires healthy food and high standards of hygiene and animal welfare which can be found in small-scale farming businesses and organic farms. These cause an increase in production costs and consumers then choose cheaper products. While our domestic farmers are subject to strict regulations, it is difficult to monitor the standards which apply to cheap agricultural imports. This is why we need fair prices and a change in the agricultural subsidy system. We must move away from supporting multinational agribusinesses and large-scale hobby farmers like the Queen and instead support small farmers who can only survive by running their farms on a part-time basis alongside another job.

In Bulgaria, only 10% of livestock farmers own their land, which consequently means that only these 10% can benefit from direct payments. This situation is exacerbating the crisis in Bulgaria’s livestock sector. Due to the lack of funds to buy the quantities of feed needed for the winter, many Bulgarian farmers will be forced to slaughter their animals.</p>

In order to guarantee a supply of feed for the European livestock sector, we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty. A market focus in the agricultural industry will also mean that farmers can take responsibility for their own businesses and need not expect constant protective interventions in the market to be made by politicians. If agricultural policy is based only on individual interests, the result will be a spiral of exemptions which it will not be possible to finance and which will distort the market.

We have already seen what can happen to energy supply and prices when the EU is dependent on imports. This must not be repeated in the food sector. Livestock holdings have faced a serious threat from the recent increase in cereal prices in the EU, as well as extreme climatic conditions and speculation. This means that certain EU sectors, such as the pigmeat sector (an important branch of Lithuanian agriculture), have suffered a blow due to feed prices, which represent up to 60% of all production costs. EU livestock production systems are important for maintaining livelihoods. Lithuania may face serious consequences as a result of the crisis in the livestock sector. The agricultural sector, which employs around 8% of our workers, is an important part of our economy. Wheat and other grains are the principal areas of production. In the EU-27, there are more than 130 million livestock units. According to EU statistics, the number of livestock has fallen by 25% since 1990. A further drop in the number of livestock in the EU may cause significant changes in production, which would upset the supply of food in the EU.
