      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by David Casa, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the future of VAT (2001/2082(INI)) (A7-0318/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="4-008-000" speaker_id="28122" name="David CASA" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Malta" birth_date="16-11-1968" birth_place="Valletta" m_state="MT">
      <p sl="mt">Madam President, this report makes an important contribution to the consultation process that began in December 2010 when the Commission launched a Green Paper on the future of VAT. The current VAT system is not suitable for the internal market and has various high administrative and compliance costs and is a big burden on businesses. Besides, it is open and very vulnerable to fraud. This applies, in particular, to transactions carried out between one country and another, where the most common type of fraud, carousel fraud, is a serious issue, being the most active and costing Member States billions of euro every year. Choosing the best way forward is a big challenge and this choice should be made after thorough consultations with all those involved in some way or another. I have met many organisations, including representatives of large companies and small businesses, and now I will explain the conclusions that were agreed upon.</p>
      <p sl="mt">One of the most important points I want to mention in this report is the fact that we have to accept this status quo and move on to the principle of destination when we impose taxes on internal and cross-border transactions. Those involved readily agree on such a position, as do the assertions made in the Commission’s Green Paper, that while a system based on the principle of origin is most appropriate for the internal market, every effort to move forward in this direction has failed. There is no political will and so I think it is time we found a credible alternative. A system based on the principle of destination can only be effective if we set up one-stop shops for VAT.</p>
      <p sl="mt">The report supports the existing plan to set up these one-stop shops by 1 January 2015. This should lead to a drastic decrease in administrative costs experienced by businesses and should increase the efficiency of cross-border operations. It is worrying that many of those I have spoken to have said that, in certain cases, they prefer to do business with countries outside the European Union when we are supposed to have an internal market. This is an unacceptable situation which needs to be addressed as soon as possible. When it comes to deciding how to go about collecting VAT, it clearly emerges that more studies are required and other studies need to be revised, because I have concluded that the best system is the Data Warehouse Model. There has to be substantial infrastructural investment to switch over to this system and so we have to be cautious. Therefore, as I have already mentioned, I recommend there should be further studies in this regard to see if this system is feasible. We also have to work towards a general reduction in administrative costs. This would greatly help the small businesses sector. Other recommendations I am putting forward are a reduction in the frequency of returns, simplification of the system where one has to prove exemptions, and an increase in the use of e-government solutions, particularly when submitting VAT returns.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I think I will stop here for now and continue after listening to my colleagues.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, Mr Casa, for his positive and constructive report on the Green Paper on the future of VAT.</p>
      <p sl="en">When this Commission began its mandate, we felt that the time had come to have a fresh look at the European VAT system, which has now been in place for over 40 years. It is indeed high time to develop a new and modern VAT system – fully compatible with the single market and with newly emerging business models – which should continue to ensure and even improve its role as a revenue raiser in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Green Paper on the future of VAT presented in December 2010 constituted the first step in this process. The overwhelming reactions from stakeholders confirmed that there was a need for such a debate. More than 1 700 written contributions were submitted. They generally confirm that the current VAT system is too complex and burdensome, primarily because of the existing divergences across the EU. This is quoted as a major obstacle to maximising the benefits of our internal market, in particular, for smaller businesses. One conclusion that can already be drawn is that our initiative has created considerable expectations. Indeed, fundamental changes to all major aspects of the VAT system are advocated by business stakeholders as well as the general public.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next step in this process of reforming VAT will be a communication to be presented before the end of 2011, identifying a comprehensive strategy for a stable and long-term VAT regime. Clearly, it will not be possible to tackle all aspects of VAT at once. The communication will set out the ultimate objectives to pursue and make a distinction between those areas in which progress can be made in the short term and those areas which will still require more substantial work and in which results can only be expected in the longer term.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the forthcoming debate of the College on its work programme for 2012, I will propose new initiatives directly linked with one of our main priorities, namely, consolidation and sustainable growth. In this framework, concrete proposals will follow the new VAT strategy. They will cover issues such as a rapid reaction mechanism, VAT governance with the business community and a reduction in the administrative burden for businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">The opinion of Parliament expressed in this report often reflects the view of the stakeholders. It is also ambitious. For the Commission, this is positive and encouraging. I can already assure this House that its opinion will be given full consideration.</p>

    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="4751" name="Bart STAES" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control" nationality="Belgium" birth_date="07-08-1958" birth_place="Izegem" p_group="Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance" m_state="BE">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control and have thus, above all, had to examine what the Green Paper says about anti-fraud measures.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is something that is not in its infancy but has been around for some time. A few years ago, we saw the report of the Court of Auditors, which pointed very explicitly to a number of shortcomings in the system. At the time, we approved an own-initiative report on the matter, which, ultimately, became the Bowles report, which the rapporteur also refers to, and in which a series of recommendations are made which I hope will continue to be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The system does indeed have a number of weaknesses, a fact which leads to fraud on a massive scale. This is estimated to be worth EUR 80-100 billion, which is an enormous amount. This also makes up a large proportion of total fiscal fraud in the European Union, which is estimated to cost EUR 200-250 billion. If we also consider that VAT carousel fraud, and VAT fraud in general, accounts for between EUR 80 and 100 billion, I think that we must then have sufficient incentive to take action.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In this connection, most of what we are seeing is cross-border fraud. There is therefore a need for cross-border cooperation. This means cooperation between the Member States’ authorities, cooperation with Europol, cooperation with Eurojust, and cooperation with OLAF. That is one of the recommendations that we, the Committee on Budgetary Control, are very happy to make.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I thank the rapporteur and the entire Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the fact that they incorporated much of my opinion into paragraphs 33 to 40 verbatim. This is important, and I thank the rapporteur and the Committee. It is rare for an opinion to be incorporated so meticulously.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The issue is one of cross-border cooperation, and we must ensure that accountability and risk awareness relating to this kind of fraud are increased in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In my opinion, there is also a need for a cross-border and more uniform definition of VAT carousels. During my research and when drawing up my report, I spoke to many people in the field, including many inspectors, and there was one clear piece of advice that came up, which was to establish a comprehensive and uniform definition of VAT carousel fraud. Harmonised administrative penalties are also needed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission should now urgently bring forward proposals on simplifying and consolidating anti-fraud legislation in this area. I see this as an important demand. You should also do something – as the rapporteur has already said – to simplify and consolidate VAT legislation. Many inspectors working every day in the field, dealing every day with this sort of crime, tell us that this is cross-border fraud and that we therefore need to cooperate across those borders.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is also a language barrier at play. If we have to study the VAT legislation of a particular Member State and we do not know its language, then we are faced with an enormous problem. Another of the pointers I have been given was that we should at least ensure that the VAT legislation of all Member States is translated into a number of basic languages. The Committee on Budgetary Control has opted for French, English and German, but we can discuss this.</p>
      <p sl="nl">EUROFISC, a Belgian initiative for the establishment of a network, strikes me as being a very good initiative. I think that the Commission must realise that this creates added value. I also urge the Commission to ensure that it reports to Parliament and keeps us up to date on this matter so as to guarantee transparency.</p>
      <p sl="nl">These, I think, are the main points of my report, although there is also the matter of new technologies. These can help us to combat VAT fraud. I tend to think that if the recommendations of the rapporteur, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control are followed, the European Union will be a little stronger in tackling this important type of fraud.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the development and full implementation of the internal market cannot be carried out without an effective, efficient value-added tax (VAT).</p>
      <p sl="it">I am perfectly in agreement with the report presented by Mr Casa, which highlights a whole series of shortcomings and also provides a set of procedures for compensating for them. I urge the Commission to act quickly, however, because I believe strongly that we are lagging behind.</p>
      <p sl="it">The next VAT system must introduce effective, rigorous harmonisation, with common rules, in order to avoid the competitive advantages that damage companies and consumers, and hence the internal market, especially for companies with cross-border activities. Therefore, in this sense, cooperation can only be introduced if there is an actual, real desire for it on the part of Member States, and this means leaving behind national egotism.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another important point that Mr Casa touched on is the reduction in red tape, not least for the purpose of cutting the administrative costs of compliance with VAT regulations. Here we have a real paradox: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) pay much more than larger companies, or rather they have higher costs, particularly if they have cross-border activities. Therefore, the measures to be introduced must lead to greater simplification but, at the same time, to an increase in legal certainty for companies and administrations. What kind of models am I calling for, then? Harmonised models and special regimes for SMEs. Europe is very much counting on SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally – allow me to make this comment in passing, ladies and gentlemen – the next VAT strategy must lead to an extension of the tax base in order to foster fiscal consolidation. At a time of crisis, I believe that everyone should pay. It should not just be the lower-income bands or people with a fixed income who pay.</p>

      <p sl="it">deputising for Markus Ferber, rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of public finances facing many European Member States is now clear for all to see. Therefore, it is not a time to be fighting over principles. Instead, we need to focus on common objectives, such as a return to sustainability in public budgets, and this means focusing on much broader goals.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Casa on his truly excellent work. While basing itself on the solid foundations of the Commission’s Green Paper, the report focuses on extremely important points. In this regard, I find the reference to reducing fraud particularly instructive. When citizens are being asked to make further sacrifices in order to improve the budget situation in leading European countries, there should be no flank left exposed to tax evaders and fraudsters. EU transactions need to be carried out within a simple fiscal framework, so that companies are absolutely not burdened by any additional administrative costs beyond those they already have to bear.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that a further aspect should be underlined, one which I feel Mr Casa has thoroughly explored, regarding the markers this resolution puts in place for the healthier development of the internal market. More effective collection and simpler administration for businesses would inevitably foster business between Member States. This seems to me to be a thoroughly commendable objective, particularly at a time like the present, when the market needs a boost to get going and to get resources moving, and, at the same time, to create wealth.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to congratulate Mr Casa once again, because I believe that this resolution is balanced and focuses on the true priorities. Now it is time to take action.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation which has resulted in a good report in which we, the European Parliament, are sending a number of very clear messages in the debate about the reform of the VAT system in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That system must be made simpler, more efficient and more transparent. I believe that Mr Casa’s report helps take the debate forward. It is not the end but rather the beginning of a long road, and we are waiting for proposals from the Commission in order to continue along the way.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the debate, we must, of course, be aware that there has been a shift in recent years from direct to more indirect taxation, but this has not yet been enough to guarantee the funding of the welfare state. It is therefore important that account is taken in this debate of fiscal proposals concerning a financial transaction tax, energy taxation, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Reforming VAT is clearly not neutral either. It is an important policy instrument that has a direct impact on consumption behaviour. It can either stimulate or discourage the purchase of goods. We therefore take the view that reduced VAT rates and exemptions must remain possible, for instance, for the non-profit sector and voluntary associations, and for social reasons.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For a number of sectors, account must also be taken of new trends and policy priorities. These include the transport sector, in which aviation and maritime transport are treated differently to the railways, a fact which hampers the development of a level playing field between the different means of transport and gives rise to market disruption.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We see more or less the same picture in the cultural sector, in which books should receive the same VAT treatment irrespective of the form they take, so that the same rate applies to downloadable and streamed books as to, for example, books printed on paper. We must also carefully examine such matters as well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, allow me to say a few words about efficiency and fraud. This has already been raised by other speakers. The system absolutely must become less sensitive to fraud, given that a figure of EUR 80-100 billion per year in lost VAT revenues has been reported. It goes without saying that this is unacceptable. Better monitoring and better consultation between services are a must. We also support simplifying the administration, although on the condition that doing so does not open up any back doors and that it helps us to combat fraud.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We also support the move towards a destination principle based on the place of consumption. This must go hand in hand with the introduction of well-functioning one-stop shops throughout the Union.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In conclusion, Madam President, I think that this report will definitely contribute to the debate and is a good start; we await the Commission’s initiatives on the matter with baited breath.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur, who has done a sterling job. This is an excellent report. I am sure our shadow rapporteur, who, for practical reasons, is speaking after me today, will be able to come back to the group’s overall view, but this report really is very good.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to take the opportunity to bring up the question of VAT exemption for non-profit making organisations, which is something that we have already debated here in the European Parliament. Commissioner, you will remember, I am sure, that some of us expressed concerns about this when you visited our committee in Strasbourg a few months ago. At that time, you were not particularly keen on the prospect of a VAT exemption for non-profit making organisations. We in Parliament did not think this was necessarily the best response and you may have noticed that I and a number of colleagues have succeeded in including an excellent passage on this matter in this report, which is something I welcome.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It seems a little ironic that, during the European Year of Volunteering, the Commission is attacking Member States whose taxation systems include VAT exemption. I am referring here to the infringement proceedings that the Commission has initiated against Sweden and other Member States. This is politically unacceptable, and I am pleased that a very clear majority in the European Parliament also rejected this in the report we are debating today, which is something that the Commission ought to take note of as it takes these matters further.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Otherwise, I have to say that the report is very good, as I said, and I am pleased that we are getting to grips with the question of fiscal fraud, in particular, this being a major problem in many quarters and something that we really must be able to get to grips with, among other things, in order to increase tax revenue, which we may have need of during the current economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Last but not least, I think that it might be worth mentioning that VAT is a good example of the fact that we can coordinate tax in Europe, something that we ought to do in other areas of taxation, too, and in that respect, it is good that cooperation on VAT is continuing at European level.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, may I start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Casa, for his diligent work on this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any report on taxation is likely to be controversial because the right to levy tax is one of the fundamental powers of a sovereign state. That is why so many in this Chamber, including the Commissioner, want the EU to have the power to levy taxes on our citizens and why we Conservatives do not.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report deals with VAT and there are many aspects of it that I welcome. I am pleased that the references to the financial transaction tax and other EU own resources were removed. I like Mr Casa’s focus on reducing administrative burdens and costs for our businesses. The report also recognises that any new VAT proposals must be fraud-proof and help, in particular, to end carousel fraud. I am happy to see our governments in the Council adopting a more coordinated approach towards VAT. It is another important step towards the efficient functioning of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Where I disagree with this report is over the call made, in paragraph 46, for Member States to increase the level of tax harmonisation. Coordination between sovereign states is one thing, harmonisation by the EU is another. This is not a proposal with which my Group can agree, because of our belief that the right to levy taxes and to decide how they are levied should remain with the nation states.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the report includes measures to address and reduce red tape, but I have been unable to identify any strong political will to eliminate the problem of professional tax evaders, not so much in the report as in the Commission’s intentions. VAT fraud – as the report states – amounts to EUR 100 billion and VAT revenue in the order of 11% is being concealed.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, my second comment, the most important comment by our group, is that these measures may consolidate the trend towards shifting taxation from direct to indirect taxes, meaning that the policy applied by the European Union will be to reduce direct taxes, to reduce corporation tax, and to reduce tax on multinationals and increase indirect taxes, in other words, VAT, on consumer goods. This increase will be paid for by our workers, together with other cuts, and will bring about an unfair system. Consequently, the future of a VAT system with such characteristics and the future of taxation policy in general are at odds with the future of a prosperous economic and social policy in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, just a few thoughts I had while assessing this comprehensive report.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Firstly, the fact that VAT collection instruments and methods currently in force are hopelessly outdated, and that the sooner we replace them, the better it will be for us all, particularly in the midst of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Secondly, the reform of the VAT system should be implemented expeditiously, but should properly take into account the needs of consumers, because they are among the main actors covering the costs of this tax and its inefficiency.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Thirdly, it is very important to ensure that the Member States themselves are able to adopt a decision on the application of a reduced VAT rate in areas that are important to them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, VAT is sometimes called a luxury tax, yet it is a luxury for those who can afford it. Those who are the highest earners in society know how to avoid paying VAT, while the poorest in society seem to have to bear the brunt, whether on domestic fuel or general household goods. It has a cost to the UK taxpayer of almost GBP 15 billion a year which is transferred from the UK to the European Union in VAT payments, and governments of all persuasions in the UK forget to actually advertise that VAT is an EU tax, or an EU-inspired tax. We can no longer support this and this is not a tax that should be on an EU scale. It should be for a national government to decide what sales tax it should have and all revenue should stay within the Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">The example that I have already alluded to is the VAT on domestic fuel. Now this was a political hot potato in the UK in the early 1990s. The then Conservative Government lost a lot of political credibility when it tried to increase VAT to 15%. It never explained once that it had to do it because of EU membership. The then Labour opposition criticised this tax as being an affront to poor people; yet when Labour came to power in 1997 did they abolish it? No. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, had to come here cap in hand to ask permission to reduce it to 5%. So what happened to it being a tax on ordinary people? This VAT is a scam on the ordinary working class people of my country and should be abolished at an EU level.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, from an economic point of view, VAT plays an important role in maintaining healthy government budgets and, of course, a healthy European budget and, with the well-publicised fiscal problems in the European Union, it is important for the VAT system to work both properly and efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="el">Unfortunately, the administrative complexity of the current VAT system is having a significant effect on the administration of businesses throughout Europe. Let us not forget that obligations such as full recovery of VAT and the integration of various VAT payments into a business’s financial planning are more feasible for bigger businesses, making life comparatively more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for 99% of businesses in the European Union. It also leaves a great deal of room for fraud and tax evasion.</p>
      <p sl="el">Bearing these factors in mind, the proposals in this report represent an exceptional contribution on the part of Parliament in a sector which does not come within its legislative remit. Of course, measures to reduce red tape, such as convergence of administrative practices and a Standard European Invoice, will not change the VAT system, but may make a difference.</p>
      <p sl="el">The VAT collection measures designed to reduce fraud will enable Member States to save billions. On the question of cross-border fraud, if higher financial commitments are needed in order to conduct effective investigations and use new technologies, then neither the Member States nor the European Union should avoid them. Also, we urgently need to simplify and unify legislation to combat fraud.</p>
      <p sl="el">I was pleased to see that the report links future changes to VAT rates and zero rates with social and environmental priorities. In the Committee on Transport’s opinion, we call for a lower or zero rate for public transport and, even though this was not included in the report, we hope that it will be included in the Member States’ list of goods and services which qualify for a reduction in the VAT rate called for by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, bearing in mind the coordinated effort being made to improve road safety by 2020, it would be a positive move if road safety equipment were to benefit from a reduced VAT rate.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say a big thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Casa, who has done a truly excellent job. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has an essentially positive view of the Commission’s Green Paper. Europe needs closer coordination of its VAT systems in order to be able to improve and strengthen the internal market. Our VAT systems differ far too much in the way they are organised and this creates obstacles for companies operating across national borders. Therefore, better coordination of VAT policy within the Union is necessary and we welcome the harmonisation of VAT rates.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We support the idea of tax neutrality. Reducing labour taxes and increasing VAT in terms of certain VAT rates is a good idea. Individuals and companies must not be forced to take on increased tax burdens. It is also good that the report highlights the importance of looking closely into the consequences for regional and municipal autonomy with regard to the right of taxation in the event of a shift from direct to indirect taxation. This could be very important for several countries.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As has already been said, we also need to limit the number of VAT exemptions, which create higher administrative costs and additional bureaucracy. However, I have to admit that there is one exemption that I am strongly in favour of, and which Mr Haglund also mentioned, and that is VAT exemption for non-profit making organisations. As you know, the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Sweden in the spring on account of tax exemption for non-profit making organisations. Together with MEPs from six Member States, I have tabled a joint proposal for VAT exemption for the non-profit making sector, and I am pleased that the proposal for national VAT exemptions for non-profit making organisations received such a high level of support in committee and from the rapporteur. This sends an important signal to the Commission that voluntary, not-for-profit work must be encouraged, not stifled.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to emphasise the importance of all books and newspapers, regardless of their format, being treated in exactly the same way when it comes to setting VAT rates. I would like to thank the President and the Commissioner, and I wish the Commissioner luck with a difficult and challenging task.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to raise three points. The first is to offer my congratulations and thanks to Mr Casa. This is not political correctness but a reflection of my personal feeling. Mr Casa, I know that, as an MEP, you have devoted yourself for almost seven years to the problems of VAT and, as far as I know, you know what you are talking about. However – and this brings me to my second point and one of my concerns – I fear that the strategy of so-called green VAT, which would reduce rates for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products and services, is likely to result in tax fraud. We all agree that fraud is unacceptable, so we should not ignore that possibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">My time is up. I will speak to Mr Casa personally about my third point.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to begin with, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Casa, for his work. I am pleased because the report contains numerous references to simplifying administration, particularly red tape. By using the technological and digital tools at our disposal as well, these measures could be a great help, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to underline in particular an amendment that I tabled and which was carried, which moves towards the introduction of a Europe-wide value-added tax (VAT) exemption for SMEs. This would reduce costs and charges and, above all, facilitate wider access to the internal market, particularly for young entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, I appreciate the efforts aiming for more efficient VAT collection. This measure is necessary in order to prevent potential fraud, a phenomenon that has unfortunately been very common in recent years.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, given the significance of VAT as a source of income for the currently stretched national exchequers, any improvement in the current system is desirable. The VAT system is based on legal provisions adopted at EU level but applied by the individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">The primary guiding principle should be practical justiciability. The Commission’s Green Paper finds fault, above all, with the complexity of the existing system, which it criticises for failing to satisfy the requirements of a true internal market.</p>
      <p sl="de">The regulatory framework clearly called for by our rapporteur, involving a broad based VAT system with as few exceptions as possible, seems to me to constitute a logical approach. Objectives include greater efficiency in collection and a sensible reduction in the follow-on costs for businesses. Adjustments in line with the requirements of the internal market must ensure the proper functioning of the taxation system.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order to guarantee and increase tax revenue, the most effective approach, first and foremost, is an effective limiting of the opportunities to abuse the system. The hope remains that a disentanglement of the rules will lead to a somewhat more trouble-free implementation of future directives in the Member States. Finally, I would also like to add my thanks for a sound report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the report that we are debating here today takes the right approach, presenting a modern vision of value-added tax (VAT) and taxation, and includes a series of proposals that should act as an incentive for the initiative that the Commission could and should present to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For this very reason, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Casa, whom I know well, and I am aware of his concerns about these matters. These concerns are amply demonstrated when the report mentions that VAT is a source of state income, but that it also has an impact on the functioning of the market and its actors, as well as a major impact on the functioning of the internal market. That is exactly why it is important that there be fewer costs for users, fewer costs and administrative burdens, less bureaucracy and better combating of fraud and tax evasion, as stated in the report.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is also important, as mentioned here, that the collection system be improved. However, at this time, when the Member States are increasing their tax burdens, I would also highlight the need to look at the refund system, which often creates so many problems for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that pay VAT and then take a long time to recover any that they have overpaid.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is also crucial to create a system that pays particular attention to how SMEs work, as mentioned in this report. SMEs are the engine of our growth and of taxes too, so intervention to assist them should be encouraged, even in times of difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall conclude by saying that Parliament is committed to a better VAT system, and that this report is a demonstration of this commitment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, this report by Mr Casa is good. The principal question is why value-added tax (VAT) in the EU is being reviewed. Firstly, there is a need to make it compatible with the single market. The more systems and varieties of VAT there are, the less fluid the market. Reforming VAT encourages e-commerce, focuses competition on value and on the basic price of goods and services rather than on tax differences, combats fraud and ensures the confidence that is so vital, especially in cross-border transactions, thereby improving the economy for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and reducing administrative burdens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What other supporting measures are already under way in the single market that could be linked to VAT? One measure is a simple, clear and transparent digital support mechanism; namely, measure 7 of the single market. Measure 5 relates to services and the need to review legislation on the standardisation and implementation of the Services Directive. Measure 9 is aimed at removing tax obstacles and explicitly reviewing the VAT system and making VAT the same for online and face-to-face commerce, which we have all experienced when ordering books.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are two fundamental reasons for the pressures to reform VAT. The first of these is the economic crisis. More revenue is needed and, in some countries, this is likely to involve cutting income tax in order to promote economic development, and passing on this burden to VAT. The second major source of pressure is the ageing population, demographic ageing, and the trend from indirect taxation towards direct taxation, which is due to the reduction in the active population base.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is necessary to rethink the balance between this direct and indirect taxation. Finally, we must reconcile subsidiarity with harmonisation in these reforms.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is essential to restrict the range of variation in the standard VAT rate so that all of us can understand it better. Greater transparency is needed in setting the reduced VAT rate and its scope, and there needs to be a clear and widely publicised list of reduced rates. There is a need to study exemption thresholds for SMEs, in the knowledge that each exemption brings with it a procession of small- or large-scale fraud.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Finally, I welcome the Commission’s recent proposal to create European-level VAT.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I appreciate the fact that the report devotes considerable attention to the issue of eliminating bureaucracy in the European legislation governing VAT, and specifically to a reduction in the frequency of the periodic VAT returns.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Europe has an ageing population, and this has an impact on labour markets, savings, consumption patterns, and the stability of public budgets. There is a clear and obvious need to focus on the restructuring of tax systems. In restructuring, we must reduce the role of direct taxation, in favour of indirect taxation. I must sound a warning, however, over the attempts to transfer responsibility for tax system reform from Member States to the EU. Tax systems and the parameters thereof must stay within the remit of Member States. Attempts to harmonise VAT must be roundly rejected from the outset. VAT harmonisation would be just the first step towards creating a single tax authority. That would be a ‘road to Hell’ for Europe, to coin a phrase.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, as a result of the crisis, numerous Member States have increased their VAT rates, thereby making it an even more important source of revenue for their budgets. Every year, whenever I discuss with my students the movements of information and resources caused by Europe’s VAT system, this is always followed by heated debates about the complexity, burden and evasion which this European VAT system encourages. This is why I give my overwhelming support to the proposals featuring in the report from my colleague, Mr Casa, whose aim is for every Member State to reduce and get rid of, as far as possible, the exceptions, exemptions and reduced VAT rates, which only add to the complexity and administrative burden imposed by this tax.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I obviously support the measures for cutting the red tape required to implement this system. However, I have serious reservations about the proposals on granting a blanket exemption to activities carried out by non-profit making, non-governmental organisations since, in many cases, and I do not wish to give any examples at the moment, these organisations are merely involved in covering up tax evasion arising from some of their activities.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, all I can say is that this is an excellent report. The focus is in the right place, which is to say, on increased efficiency, reduced bureaucracy and a stronger fight against fraud. There is a great deal to be gained by improving the VAT Directive in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="sv">More specifically, I would like to emphasise the question of VAT rules for non-profit making organisations. There are weaknesses in the directive in this regard. Austria, Denmark, Finland and Sweden have been criticised by the Commission for not having applied the current legislation correctly. These countries may perhaps need to make certain adjustments to their national rules for associations, but the main problem lies at European level. The best solution would be for provisions to be introduced into the VAT Directive that allow the Member States to apply general VAT exemptions to the non-profit making sector. We need to restrict the exceptions that we allow, but in this case, it is fully justified to increase national flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The general VAT exemption for non-profit making organisations is an excellent way to promote civil society. A rich voluntary sector is the mainstay of a well-functioning democracy, and it is perfectly possible to formulate this sort of exemption in such a way that it does not distort competition. We are talking about voluntary activities on a limited scale, which are clearly separated from commercial activity. The main aim of the exemption is not to strengthen the finances of the non-profit making organisations, but to reduce the administrative burden on those enthusiastic souls who manage the budgets in their spare time. Therefore, the exemption cannot be replaced by subsidies; it is the reduction in bureaucracy that is the important issue. It is good that the report fully supports this way of looking at VAT in the voluntary sector, and it is a very important signal to the Commission ahead of the next stage of the process. I would also like to say a big thank you to the rapporteur, and thank you for the opportunity to speak.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is assumed by the European Union that an increase in VAT rates in Member States will translate into an improved budgetary intake. The reality, however, may prove to be quite different. Our part-session lasts for 22 hours. According to the Federation of Small Businesses, during this short part-session in Brussels, small and medium-sized enterprises will have spent over 23 million hours fulfilling their administrative and tax obligations. Four thousand three hundred small, mainly family-run businesses will have closed and around 19 000 people will have lost their jobs. These are only some of the facts associated with excessive administrative and tax burdens within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For this reason, adopting harmonised VAT rates for similar types of goods regardless of whether they are purchased online or offline seems an appropriate solution. We cannot agree, however, to the harmonisation of VAT in all the Member States. It is a basic principle that each country should determine its own fiscal policies. We can only support the adoption of rules by which consumption and not production of goods is taxed, as well as support adoption of the lowest possible rates of VAT.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the outstanding job he has done in addressing an aspect of economic policy where harmonisation and at least a minimum degree of coordination is indispensable in order to ensure a well-functioning and competitive EU economy. When VAT was introduced 40 years ago, it met the needs of the economy of the time. Since then, however, it has undergone numerous modifications, so-called modernisation, which, let us be frank, made the system increasingly complicated. It put unnecessary burdens on both taxpayers and tax authorities and, at the same time, acted as an impediment to the creation of an integrated EU market. Its many weak points made it vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="hu">As a result it lent itself to tax fraud and tax evasion, causing a considerable loss of tax income amounting to hundreds of billions. At the same time, VAT must be recognised as a very important source of budgetary income that enables us to finance our welfare systems. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that we do need both exceptions and exemptions, but we must assess very carefully where we can allow exemptions and exceptions without distorting competition in future. I welcome the report’s objective to strengthen action against fraud, as well as the simplification of administrative procedures. Another aspect I support and consider important is ensuring transparency and traceability of the system, in particular, when it comes to cross-border activities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, I also find it important to note that it would be a good idea to forget about the categories of ‘within national borders’ and ‘within the European Union’. These categories are, in fact, obstacles to the integrated internal market of the EU. I also find Data Warehouse Models to be useful. I believe that we need to introduce what has already proven its worth in Member States and truly results in a budgetary surplus. Once again, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for considering my motion for amendment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union’s interim VAT system, which has been in place for 16 years, currently represents a significant obstacle for European businesses in their activities within the internal market. Meanwhile, the complexity of the rules and their differing implementations at national level give rise to administrative costs, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, that cannot carry on like this. This is particularly the case when it comes to cross-border electronic trading, which, with its enormous potential for growth, is of fundamental importance for the internal market. Ultimately, European consumers also benefit from such trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against the backdrop of the economic and financial crises, the legislative initiative to be brought forward by the Commission is therefore indispensable, Commissioner. I very much welcome the debate occasioned by the advent of the Green Paper. We advocate the simplification of the processes and the removal of bureaucratic obstacles. My friend and colleague, Mr Casa, has submitted an outstanding proposal containing sensible measures such as the introduction of a Standard European Invoice and reducing the frequency of VAT returns.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is regrettable – and I want to point this out specifically – that the Member States are manifestly holding back on their cooperation on the implementation of the country of origin principle for cross-border transactions. Not only the Member States, but also the Commission and Parliament had all come out in favour of this previously. The fact that we are now moving towards a destination principle and a system based on the place of consumption is not ideal, although certainly a conceivable option, which the rapporteur is proposing here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, we advocate a regulation rather than a directive, in order to allow for better and more standardised application of the rules on VAT in the European Union while, at the same time, creating an effective system for the internal market and the businesses operating within it.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr Casa, for this balanced report representing Parliament’s strong position on the reform of the value-added tax system, which has been in preparation for a long time now. The great extent to which standard tax rates in the Member States vary, and the many types of VAT exemptions and threshold values that apply, have led to the distortion of competition in certain sectors and have harmed the development of a viable internal market. A system that has been in effect for 17 years now requires a more thorough overhaul.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is especially important to reform the system now, in the midst of the economic crisis. Tax evasion and tax fraud eat into the tax base and leave honest citizens and companies to pay the taxes that have been avoided by the perpetrators of fraud.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The report stresses the importance of cooperation between the tax administrations of the Member States and urges the Commission to develop a coordinated strategy to fight fiscal fraud. The so-called Green VAT strategy contained in this report, however, gives rise to a few questions. I hope that the specifics can be worked out without more problems arising.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In future, it should be possible to ease the administrative burden associated with VAT and make reporting as easy as possible for small and medium-sized enterprises. It is to be hoped that a new system would take better account of the position of labour-intensive sectors, such as the craft industries. Value-added tax can easily become an additional tax on work when the end product hardly allows for the possibility of reducing material costs.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Member States also have different tax practices relating to charitable and not-for-profit organisations. The report expresses a desire to see Member States strengthening civil society by exempting these from value-added tax wherever appropriate. I hope that this practice will also be adopted in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, allow me to begin by congratulating my fellow Members and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Casa, on his excellent report and the superb work that he has brought before us here.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report advocates simplifying and harmonising the value-added tax (VAT) system in the EU, which will lead to greater transparency and efficiency, as well as less bureaucracy and less fraud. In this way, we can improve the workings of the internal market and contribute to increasing competitiveness, which is much needed, in the euro area and the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Combating VAT fraud is a priority. It is even estimated that this fraud could total up to EUR 100 billion. VAT receipts represent more than 21% of the Member States’ tax revenue, and is thus an important source of revenue for national budgets. In many of them, it is even the main source of funding.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If we have clear and unequivocal rules, we can advocate the neutrality principle and reduce the administrative burdens resulting from EU VAT legislation. Companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), cannot bear the administrative costs that they incur by charging VAT. It is worth noting that SMEs represent more than 99% of companies and around 67.4% of jobs in the EU. In Portugal, SMEs represent 81.4% of the total number of jobs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Countries receiving external assistance need to be alert and ensure that they act with particular and targeted solidarity, especially as regards taxes. These Member States have been obliged to increase their taxes and are now being called on to consider VAT exemption thresholds, and to set out lists of common goods and services eligible to benefit from tax exemptions or reduced taxes. This is the reason why I am urging particular solidarity and a focus of attention.</p>

      <p sl="it">There are two points I think the Commission needs to consider for its forthcoming engagements. With regard to exemption, it is definitely a good idea to look into exemptions for associations, non-profit making organisations and non-governmental organisations, but in doing so, the Commission will have to take due account of the need to cleanse the system of exemptions that have been misused. Secondly, it is important to work on legal certainty and the reduction of administrative burdens, and on adaptation to innovative technological processes, because this is very useful to businesses and to the market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, value-added tax is a vital source of revenue for national budgets. In many Member States, it is even the main source of revenue. While, at the start of the economic crisis, VAT receipts accounted for roughly 8% of Member States’ GDP, their proportion has subsequently grown significantly due to Member States needing to increase their VAT rates.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Given that the VAT system accounts for around 60% of companies’ administrative burden, I think that it is vital to the smooth running of the economy for this system to be simplified and updated, especially during a crisis. I call for the quickest possible regulation of the aspects relating to obligations, deductibility and rates, as these are the main grounds for concern that economic operators have. Their complexity hampers economic operators’ activities, increases costs and very often makes European systems less attractive to foreign investors, thereby holding back regional development.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, at a time of economic crisis and excessive public deficit, VAT has proved to be an important source of revenue for national budgets. However, increasing its rate is no guarantee of economic growth either, especially when the consumption of basic foods is affected. In Romania, the VAT rate for staple food products has been held at 24%, which has not encouraged consumption, but exacerbated the poverty level. This is why I think that much fairer alternative sources of revenue need to be found.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, it is not only consumers who have had to suffer from high VAT rates. Small and medium-sized enterprises, the European Union’s economic driving force, have also been affected.

Everything I hear and have read demonstrates that in the 17 years since this tax has been in operation, it has become ever harder to collect, it has become more and more fragmented, and it has opened the door to ever more fraud. It seems that we are now thinking of giving this old, lame and sick horse new shoes, in the belief that it will race well. In my view, we should give serious consideration to abandoning this tax altogether – not immediately, but perhaps in the future – and replacing it by turnover tax, which would at once eliminate all types of fraudulent schemes and also make administration easier.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, value-added tax (VAT) is one of the most important sources of revenue for the EU Member States. In cross-border trade, however, there is great deal of tax evasion, and therefore it is proper to seek ways to improve the existing mechanisms for the recording, reporting and collection of VAT. Tax policy is the responsibility of the Member States, and therefore EU initiatives in this area are very limited. Nevertheless, in Mr Casa’s report, we can find several ideas as to how to improve the current rules. The system of VAT is built on broad foundations. According to the OECD definition, it may be a good basis for further coordinated improvement of mechanisms for cross-border transactions, accounts and collection. The efforts expended in reducing red tape could be a further benefit. Simplification of financial statements, a reduction in the frequency of submission of tax returns, as well as better utilisation of e-government or the introduction of European invoices using a language-neutral template, will certainly assist both the tax authorities and businesses. I believe that each simplification and streamlining of the system will contribute to the better collection of this tax.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the rapporteur describes lack of harmonisation as a particular problem, or shortcoming, of VAT. I cannot agree that this is a problem at all. Taxes are levied primarily to gain revenue and secondarily to have economic or social effects. Taxes are not levied to look pretty or harmonious. Each country has its own spending agenda and perceived economic and social needs, and it is they who should determine tax rates. We should not levy taxes for the sake of doing so or so that they are the same as in neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would not reform VAT, I would replace it with a simple but variable sales tax. Flat-rate VAT is a regressive tax because it is paid disproportionately by the less affluent with their high marginal propensity to consume. The zero-rated and exempt items make VAT less regressive than it would otherwise be. However, I suspect that those items would become victims of harmonisation. Furthermore, harmonisation would be impossible to escape were it to be effected by a regulation rather than by a directive.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Jobbik Party have spoken out on several occasions here against the centralisation of the European Union. However, with VAT, we have come to an issue where harmonisation is typically the only solution. It is a very inappropriate message to send to European citizens that while we should all share burdens in this Union, welfare measures are applied disparately. We need only look at how wages in Eastern Europe compare to Western Europe. And if the existence of such a social gap were not enough, VAT in Eastern Europe is essentially several times higher than general turnover tax or value-added tax in Western Europe, or exceeds it by several per cent.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungary, for example, envisions a record VAT hike. The government will break a record in austerity measures by raising VAT in Hungary to 27%, which will put an unprecedented burden on citizens, even more so if we consider that wages are but a fraction of those in Western Europe. It would be high time for the European Union to intervene in such austerity measures and prevent them from happening. The European Union should not only step up in various abstract issues, but should also guard the sense of wellbeing of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, after more than forty years since the introduction of value-added tax (VAT), it is indeed high time for a review of this system. The aim should be to strengthen its coherence with the single market and its contribution to other policies. Reforming the VAT system can play a crucial role in supporting the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy and a return to growth through its potential to reinvigorate the single market and underpin smart budget consolidation in the Member States. Any such improvements require a comprehensive VAT system that will be able to adapt to changes in the economic and technological environment. A simpler VAT system would also reduce the operational cost to taxpayers and tax administrations, thereby increasing the net benefit to the treasury. VAT compliance costs are a major administrative burden for EU companies, and reducing this burden would contribute significantly to increasing their competitiveness. Finally, it is essential to finally find a solution whereby money, including by means of VAT, does not escape from the budgets of the Member States and disappear into so-called tax havens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I, too, would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Casa, for drafting this excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">VAT receipts are a major source of revenue for national budgets. However, during a recession, it is preferable to avoid raising the VAT rate and other taxes when an alternative is available. For example, raising the VAT rate by five percentage points in Romania, from 19% to 24%, has had an adverse impact on business, exerting pressure on this sector. Initially regarded as the way to economic recovery, according to the analyses, this measure has delayed Romania’s exit from recession, and it would have been appropriate to implement it in two stages.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Romania is currently one of the Member States with the highest VAT rate and needs to adopt measures to stimulate investments and the absorption of European funds.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, just following on from my colleague Mrs Băsescu’s comment that we need measures to stimulate the economy, I am pleased to say that in my country, the new government brought in proposals this year to reduce VAT, particularly in relation to restaurants and other areas of that nature. It has had a huge positive effect. In fairness to most of the businesses, they passed the VAT reduction on to the customer and, as a result, they have increased their customers and the number of people visiting. So certainly there are areas where we can stimulate the economy by varying the VAT rate. The idea of having the same rate right across Europe, while it is desirable in the long term, is not practical in the short term.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your comments and the views you expressed during this very interesting debate. I am glad to see that the European Parliament and the stakeholders often share views on priorities and on the action to be undertaken to achieve a simpler, more fraud-proof and efficient VAT system tailored to the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also see general strong support for our initiative and, indeed, this is more than necessary. Our role in the EU VAT system will constitute a huge task. After all, we should never forget that most of the European VAT legislation is based on Article 113 of the Treaty, requiring adoption by unanimity in the Council. If the Council were to deliver on the high expectations that have been raised, it would have to leave the comfort zone of business as usual, and some Member States might find themselves chasing their own shadows.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will, of course, take into account Parliament’s conclusions, suggestions and requests during the next steps of the review of the EU VAT system. As I said, we are finalising our work on the communication on the future of VAT, which will be issued very soon – before the end of the year – but, in parallel, we are already working on concrete proposals for improving the system and on issues that were raised today during the discussion. Issues such as fraud, better coordination of activities between Member States, and exemptions are currently the subject of detailed analyses, and when implementing the strategy, we will come forward with concrete proposals on these matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to thank this Parliament – as well as Mr Casa personally – for its strong support and constructive approach.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank all my colleagues for their contribution and for the support they have given me now and which they apparently will extend to me in the future, at least when we come to vote later on. I appreciate all the comments made about details in the report, including, for example, an agreement on a general reduction of administrative costs especially for SMEs, which are basically at the forefront of the European economy and which are currently suffering the most due to the complicated system we have in place at the moment. There are a number of proposals for changes which can be implemented immediately without major modifications to the present system. I hope at least that the Commission will take note of what we are suggesting, where, for example, the report calls on the Commission to prepare a template for invoices that is linguistically neutral. This could solve the current issue and could be implemented in the form of a system of grids based on corresponding numbers that add up, or rather harmonise, the input of data. This could therefore eliminate the problem of translation. This report also calls on the Commission to prepare a maximum set of VAT obligations. This would mean that countries already using an efficient system would not need to impose further obligations on businesses. On the other hand, businesses would have a guarantee that a list of obligations which can be imposed by Member States already exists. Business thrives under calm and stable conditions and, with this in mind, we have suggested that, when possible, especially on non-controversial issues, regulations should be used instead of directives. This increases the uniformity of interpretation and implementation of VAT legislation.</p>
      <p sl="mt">I conclude, Madam President, by thanking all those involved, the rapporteurs of the other committees, as well as the staff at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I have every confidence that this report will receive the strong support that is required when we vote on it later today, and that we, as a Parliament, will send a strong message to the Commission concerning the future of VAT that we hope is taken into consideration.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I share the sentiments of my colleagues who advocate the need to reform the VAT system, which puts Member States in a difficult situation due to the way in which it is regulated and defined at the moment. In my country, Romania, the VAT rate is one of the highest in the European Union, and there has still been no differentiation agreed for certain categories of goods or products. This is why I support the request submitted to the Commission to provide Parliament and the Council with a mandatory list of goods and services which may be subject to a reduced rate or exemption, in line with the VAT Directive.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that it is just as important to harmonise administrative practices and cut red tape. By this I mean doing away with some of the annual returns, reducing the frequency of regular returns, simplifying the proof required for a VAT export exemption, and creating the future Standard European Invoice. I hope that we will have serious consultations with companies and entrepreneurs throughout this entire process and achieve results. Please God!</p>

      <p sl="cs">One of the key instruments for EU competitiveness is a functioning single market, an important component of which is an effective tax system. The discussion over a common VAT system for the EU is therefore a step in the right direction, as we see in the Commission’s Green Paper of 1 December 2010 on the future of VAT. I therefore welcome the Commission’s plan to develop a comprehensive VAT system which would eliminate the susceptibility of the current system to fraud, would be sufficiently stable and resistant to fraud – estimated to be as high as EUR 100 billion annually in the EU – and which would contribute to greater transparency and the competitiveness of European businesses. The VAT system in operation in New Zealand should be an inspiration to the EU. For social reasons, I consider it important in the reform to retain Member State discretion in decision making on reduced rates of VAT on selected goods. The report also contains promising conclusions and proposals (VAT with a broad base, a VAT system based on location, VAT collection methods such as, for example, the limited Data Warehouse Model combined with the Certified Taxable Person model). Overall, it can be said that the report submitted by David Casa presents a detailed analysis of this issue, makes reference to the relevant legislation, and also contains relevant recommendations on the future of VAT in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The VAT system has not been changed for the last 17 years. Nowadays, we need a modern VAT framework which we can use to address the challenges facing the European Union. European business often views the current legislation as an obstacle to the smooth running of the European single market. This is why we need to simplify the current rules and reduce the administrative burden to provide a better fiscal environment for companies in the EU. Every year, VAT abuses amount to EUR 60-100 billion. One measure of paramount importance is to create new instruments for controlling and tackling VAT fraud at EU level. Another important element is to standardise information and promote international transactions within the EU. This will enable better cooperation between Member States’ tax services. Last but not least, I would like to stress that it is important for us to comply with the principle of subsidiarity so that Member States have the chance to make decisions on different levels of VAT in certain sectors, allowing national economic and social features to be taken into consideration. This will help improve the competitiveness of the entire European economy.</p>

      <p sl="lv">As the author of the report on the single market, I fully support what the resolution states to be the effect of value-added tax (VAT) on the European single market. It is one of the preconditions for attracting investment, although one must admit that it is certainly not the most important precondition. In the last few years, several Member States have been forced to increase VAT in order to balance budget expenditures and cope with the challenges arising from the crisis. In Latvia, for example, VAT has been increased from 18% to 22%. I support the issues already examined in the Green Paper, including the important questions of tax neutrality and the degree of harmonisation essential in the single market. VAT is a tax on end-consumption. I therefore agree that the administrative burden associated with VAT should not be borne by businesses. The report also touches on the important aspect of the efficiency of VAT collection. Although VAT is one of the taxes that is most easily collectible, schemes for VAT fraud continue to be rife in EU Member States. The black economy is like a cancer eating away at public finances. Nevertheless, we must do all we can to encourage people to pay tax.</p>

      <p sl="fr">An overhaul of the VAT system is urgent. The economic crisis, demographic changes, the survival of our social system, a return to growth and the completion of the internal market, these are the challenges necessitating a change in the current system. In fact, VAT revenue accounted for 21.4% of tax revenue in European Union Member States in 2008, in other words, more than EUR 860 billion. Our welfare state model relies heavily on this lever. What is more, VAT adjustments are tremendous tools for boosting economic sectors with a potential for growth. Lastly, it is essential to harmonise VAT rates in other sectors to a certain level so as to avoid distortions of competition and obstacles to the common market. I therefore welcome the proposals set out in this report inviting the Commission to simplify, adapt and improve harmonisation of VAT systems in Europe, thereby allowing a return to growth. Finally, I want to point out that the adoption of a reduced VAT rate for cultural goods and services distributed on physical media or on-line must become a reality to unleash their growth potential and ensure the distribution of a diversified and quality cultural creation.</p>

      <p sl="et">In view of the significant role of value-added tax in the harmonisation of differences in taxation, for the development of a common internal market and the reduction of bureaucracy, and in order to safeguard Member States’ value-added tax revenues, I am glad that we were able to consider this topic. I believe that this report, which examines the amendment of the system for value-added tax, is important because it offers a solution to the problem that has arisen in the transport sector, offering equal opportunities to all modes of transport. Member States should ensure that similar goods and services receive like treatment in the application of value-added tax, and should also ensure that value-added tax is applied uniformly to different cross-border transport services, regardless of the mode of transport. Also, taking into consideration the public interest and social and environmental arguments, I support the proposal made in the report to introduce lower rates of value-added tax or zero rates for public transport (urban public transport, inner city transport and regional transport). Considering that 99% of entrepreneurs in the European Union are small and medium-sized enterprises, this is also of great importance in the reduction of the administrative burdens facing SMEs. The report states that administrative burdens should be reduced by 25% by 2012. The measures offered in this report include a clause that refers to the broader implementation of e-governance solutions, primarily in the electronic submission of value-added tax declarations and records. Since Estonia has had an effective system of e-governance in recent decades, I concur with the proposed resolution.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Value-added tax constitutes the most important item in each national budget, and therefore tax evasion cannot be accepted. The difference in VAT rates between each Member State is being abused for various types of fraud, particularly in cross-border transactions. In our Member States, we encounter on a daily basis illegal traders who sell goods on the street which are directly imported from other countries. When you purchase these goods, a receipt is not issued and they are sold without a cash register; mayors of villages are even announcing such sales on the municipal information service, and the inspection authorities turn a blind eye to such events. In addition to these ‘minor’ frauds, every year, larger, more sophisticated frauds involving hundreds of thousands of euro are uncovered. It is therefore high time for the introduction of a single European tax and uniform control mechanisms. The economic crisis is revealing flaws in the selection and control of individual taxes and VAT is one of the most important of these.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I fully share the honourable Members’ fight against protectionism generally. The Commission is putting particular emphasis on open markets and the role of trade in growth and jobs. This is why we are such staunch defenders of multilateral trade rules and why we continue to fight against protectionism in fora such as the WTO and the G20.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout the economic crisis, we have managed rather well to maintain open markets and avoid the easy trap of closing them, which would have had very grave consequences. This is no different when it comes to our relations with the United States. We remain in close contact and address barriers where they arise, bilaterally or through the WTO system. The Transatlantic Economic Council plays a crucial role in preventing trade-distorting measures through a focus on non-tariff barriers, and I must say that this new approach agreed last year by Deputy National Security Adviser, Mike Froman, and Commissioner Karel De Gucht, is working well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The whole idea of the Transatlantic Economic Council is to prevent divergent regulations before they arise, through upstream regulatory cooperation. In other words, working together in areas where we are just beginning to regulate in order to avoid barriers tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is at the heart of moving closer to a transatlantic marketplace where further integration will work for the creation of jobs and growth. Estimates put the number of jobs depending on transatlantic trade at 15 million and our joint aim is to strengthen this. The recent announcement of the American Jobs Act, which the honourable Member was referring to, would, according to available information, subject the proposed new spending on infrastructure to ‘Buy American’ requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">While this initiative is still at the stage of legislative proposal, we are closely looking into its details and potential impact on EU suppliers. We are raising our preliminary observations with our US counterparts both bilaterally and in the framework of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Our immediate aim is to ensure that the rights of our suppliers are not limited. We are generally concerned about such measures being envisaged or adopted by any trading partner. We believe that open trade should be promoted as an essential requirement for fast recovery.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has just indicated the extent to which the Commission is attempting to take up contact with the Americans in order to prevent new potential barriers to trade.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, when I read what the United States is currently planning and proposing, it says, and I quote,</p>
      <p sl="de">‘None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance or repair of a public building or public work unless all of the iron, steel and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States’.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, quite simply, this is intolerable and we must make that very plain to the Americans. This has nothing to do with partnership and friendship, it is pure protectionism which, incidentally, also does harm to the Americans themselves, as they are well aware. I therefore wish that the Commission would not stop at statements in the plenary of this House, but would take a truly active role.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wish that we would finally bring an end to our purely defensive strategies. Why not try a big shot for once? We are doubtless all aware of the major economic difficulties in which the United States currently finds itself. We can also see, however, the crisis in which many Member States of the European Union currently find themselves. Why do we not use this opportunity to approach the Americans and propose that we set up a joint transatlantic project that might jump-start our economies on both sides of the Atlantic through a mutual pact for work and employment, for growth and the stimulation of our economies? I am firmly convinced that, instead of our current defensive approach, which involves attempting to hold the Americans back from lunacy, we should take the offensive and consider whether we can create a joint package with the Americans, that, taken as a whole, could drive forward the economic conditions in the world’s leading economies. I would be very grateful if the Commission were to take an active role in this area.</p>

This legislative proposal is likewise certainly no indication that the Americans are serious about opening up markets, which is what could take us all forwards. It is therefore all the more important that the Commission should finally take a new direction. What I just proposed – namely, that we should attempt to conclude a real transatlantic pact for growth and employment in order to produce a joint stimulus package for both economies on the two sides of the Atlantic – could perhaps be an approach to maybe hold back the Americans from lunacy – I am repeating myself here – and truly make a difference to the strongest economies in the world.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we could sum up our debate by saying that, while Athens is weeping, Sparta is not rejoicing, in the sense that both Europe and the United States are going through a serious crisis, and both are struggling to come up with the solutions needed to overcome the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The world is certainly sending some undesirable signals with regard to the approach we must take in order to relaunch the economy, with our focus being mainly on regulating the financial markets and, to a lesser extent, on the possibilities of developing the global economy. We have to move away from the debate between those in favour of economic rigour and those who support growth, because Europe and the rest of the world need rigour in the management of their public debt and public resources, but they also need to grow, and we need to be seriously concerned about the protectionist signals coming from the United States, from Argentina, from Brazil, with the introduction of new taxes, and from parts of the world such as the Mercosur countries, which are facing difficulties today.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must therefore pay a great deal of attention and understand that the world markets have to be extended, safeguarded and broadened, and that we have to eliminate barriers in order to encourage growth. Mr Caspary’s proposal was very interesting, and I think that as part of the logic of opening up world markets, we should have a far-reaching Marshall Plan, a new Marshall Plan for developing countries, so that they can compete with the major players that compete with us. On the same day that the House rejected President Obama’s plan containing the ‘Buy American’ provisions – which we oppose – the United States Senate passed a law on the issue of the yuan and the strengthening of the yuan against the dollar.</p>
      <p sl="it">These are also measures which must be seen in the context of a new way of managing world monetary policy. Alongside an open global trading policy, we need to safeguard EU interests, and we also need a new Bretton Woods agreement to define the world’s monetary framework.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, America and the EU face similarly large challenges when it comes to resolving the economic crisis, and cooperation should be our intention in order to sustain this recovery.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is, however, a serious discrepancy between EU and US measures that is a reason for concern. The protectionist tendencies in the US Jobs Act seem to block access to public procurement for EU-based companies. This is of concern not only to this Parliament, but also to large sections of the US business community itself, where it is feared that the Jobs Act is out of step with a balanced US procurement policy, and that it will undermine the US ability to grow exports and jobs by accessing foreign markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">Countermeasures may well result, such as those we saw in 2009 from the Canadian side. Trade is necessary for job creation, and trade is global. In global trade, the US should not alienate one of its closest partners, the EU. We both face the challenge of the emerging economies and we also have a number of opportunities, such as the development of a comprehensive, transatlantic growth and jobs initiative – which would include plans for the removal of remaining non-tariff barriers to trade and investment by 2020 and steps towards zero tariff levels for certain types of product.</p>
      <p sl="de">Now that the Senate has voted against the Jobs Act in the US, this should be the moment for the EU to address some of our problems again. Can the Commissioner explain whether he sees a difference between the impact of ‘Buy American’ and that of ‘Buy America’ – applying respectively to public procurement at federal and local levels? These remarkably similar titles could easily confuse people. Is ‘Buy America’ applicable to Canada and to EU partners, despite the WTO general procurement agreement, as Canada and the US business community argue, or is Ambassador Kirk right in rejecting these concerns? Will the Commission push for reciprocity in the public procurement rules between the EU and the US at both the federal and local levels?</p>
      <p sl="de">The asymmetry between US and EU access to markets is striking. I would like to learn from the Commission what the results of conversations with the Americans on this subject have been so far, and whether it proposes that flexible rules or measures should be introduced on the EU side, should that be necessary. I would also like to ask what this Parliament and the Transatlantic Economic Council could do to help the Commission sustain openness and global trade between the two sides of the Atlantic.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, a lot of what I was going to say has been said. I totally agree with what Daniel Caspary said. We are at a crucial stage in the world economic crisis and the US has G20 commitments to which it must adhere. We should be working together to bring both our economics together in difficult circumstances. Furthermore, the US should be further integrating its economy into those of the western world, especially those with whom it shares values. This is because of the rise in Asia. Daniel touched on some of the problems there. Let me just remind the Commissioner – who said that Commissioner De Gucht had made an agreement a year ago – for public procurement in the US, there is a 25% tariff on anything that goes in from outside the United States. If that is shared values, then there is something wrong.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am going to ask the Commission if it can answer two questions. Does the Commission consider closer economic integration towards a transatlantic market place a realistic goal? What action does the Commission intend to take to develop, together with the United States, an involving comprehensive transatlantic growth and jobs initiative, which would include plans to remove the remaining non-tariff barriers to trade and investment in 2020, the so-called ‘transatlantic market’, and to take steps towards zero tariff levels in some product areas?</p>
      <p sl="en">While I have been in this Parliament – and I have been involved in the Committee on International Trade for quite a while – there has been an ongoing battle with the United States over Boeing and Airbus. The WTO ruled recently in Airbus’s favour. What has happened? What has the Commission done to ensure the survival of the European industry? It is vital for jobs at a time when the economy is suffering. I call upon the Commission to look further.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see the Commissioner is leaving now, so he cannot answer the questions. I will leave it, Madam President.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the current situation demonstrates the futility of persisting with the same so-called ‘austerity’ policies, which are always accompanied by greater liberal pressure, more privatisations and a renewed insistence on the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).</p>
      <p sl="pt">It should already be clear that, without changing the policies and fundamentals of the economic and monetary union, it is impossible to prioritise jobs with rights, and the elimination of poverty, social exclusion, and society’s inequalities and injustices. We would therefore stress the urgent need for an employment and social progress pact, and the abolition of the current SGP once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is time to terminate programmes of veritable aggression towards the workers and peoples of Greece, Portugal and Ireland currently being imposed by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Commission. As the struggling workers and peoples in various Member States are demanding, it is time for a break with the monopoly capitalism policies that are exacerbating the economic situation and causing profound social injustices in the majority of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">All this is happening at the same time as they are preparing to give billions of euro to the banks, transferring their debts to the public sector. In other words, these debts will be transferred to the workers, young people and women who are in precarious situations or are unemployed; to the pensioners without a decent income; and to the small and medium-sized enterprises that can no longer withstand the financial throttling and the sharp decline in the public’s purchasing power.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The key issue in this debate, more than worrying about what is happening in this area in the US, is knowing what the leaders of the EU, the Commission and the Council will ultimately propose in order to reverse the severe situation of unemployment, precarious and poorly paid work, and poverty and social exclusion currently being experienced in various EU countries, and which will become exponentially worse if they persist with these policies.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am going to talk about jobs now. We have 40% youth unemployment in parts of the European Union, and it is being suggested by people here that this is some sort of act of God. It is not an act of God: it is sheer, unadulterated incompetence. Look at what the EU is doing. Look at the barriers it is putting in front of companies, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, preventing them from employing people. We have minimum wages. We have pensions. We have holiday entitlements. We have a job tax – called national insurance in my country – which is absolutely huge, so the employee does not actually get half the money that is being paid by the employer. Trying to get rid of lazy and incompetent workers is virtually impossible, so sacking people is very difficult. And if you cannot hire, you cannot fire, so you lose flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have maternity leave, paternity leave, stress leave and all the rest of the nonsense that is invented by people here who have absolutely no commercial experience at all. It is not an accident that we have 40% of our young people unemployed: it is your fault. And let me remind you of liberty of contract. In a free society, we should have liberty of contract so that an employer and an employee can get together, sign a contract and get on with their lives without interference from this place.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, there will certainly be a long debate on the American Jobs Act and, despite the fact that it has recently been stalled in the American Senate, it should be possible to hold a long debate on this subject; it appears that in this forum, both you, as representatives of the Commission, and also my colleagues here in the European Parliament, will examine it in particular in terms of its compliance with international rules of free trade. Of course this is an important aspect and, should any inconsistencies be found, we should act in the interests of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="sk">On the one hand, we could smile laconically at the fact that when the chips are down, the strong players adopt protectionist measures and the principles of fair competition that they preach when it suits them are cast aside at these times of crisis. On the other hand, though, I find a certain amount of assertiveness in its own way attractive. The assertiveness with which the American administration approaches the solution to the economic crisis could be, in its own way, an inspiration to us in the European Union. Let us try to set aside the question as to whether the law violates the rules of free trade or not. The zeal with which the US President Obama presented the law before Congress is something that European leaders are unfortunately lacking at both a national and a European level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The assertiveness with which the United States of America presents the argument in accountable political circles that the crisis is not primarily about the deficit, but about the economy and employment, is indeed impressive and inspirational. I believe that from a certain angle, this could make an impression on us and I reiterate that it is my belief that this should inspire, in particular, our national leaders.</p>

      <a text="(Laughter)"/>
      <p sl="sv">Madam President, I agree with the criticism directed at this package and President Obama’s attempt to obstruct free trade. We know, after all, that a free market economy and free trade are the way to bring about progress and better economic conditions for the whole world. Now this comes as no surprise and it is the Democrats, in particular, who are not making sufficient effort to stand up for free trade. The Republicans may be wrong in many respects, but they have always been better when it comes to free trade.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I certainly think that a number of Members of this House can also consider Europe’s experience. Yesterday, we had a proposal for an agricultural policy that involved anything but free trade, and there are many proposals in the European Parliament that advocate restricting trade even within Europe. However, I hope, and I share Ms Schaake’s assessment (and incidentally, she is not in the Chamber), that right now, when Congress does not really know which way the decisions will go, we have the opportunity to negotiate a better proposal that takes account of both the economic problems in the US and the economic problems in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">After all, it is the deficits that are the absolutely fundamental problems, and we must get away from these deficits in both the US and Europe. That is the only way that we can have a viable economy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to finish by pointing out that the Tea Party movement in the United States is making it more difficult for President Obama to produce a reasonable proposal, which is something that we should not forget. May we be spared the Tea Party movement in Europe – otherwise it will be even more difficult to produce proposals based on sound economic policy that will create prosperity on both of our continents. I would like to say that President Obama is a good friend and a good combatant when it comes to Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Mr Šefčovič, what we are discussing here relates to international economic cooperation. We often discuss the financial crisis and rescuing the banks and the euro. Incredible sums of money have been made available that should have been enough to boost employment throughout the world and thereby conquer hunger.</p>
      <p sl="de">We talk far too little about the people whose real existence the crisis has hit. The banks that we are to rescue have driven millions of people into unemployment through their speculation whilst also, at the same time, irresponsibly gambling with people’s pension funds.</p>
      <p sl="de">With the American Jobs Act, President Obama is seeking to finally put the fate of these people back at the heart of politics. His idea of removing financial burdens from businesses that take on new employees is a good one. European policy should learn from the example that the United States is setting.</p>
      <p sl="de">The non-policy of strangling the life out of the economy through lunatic austerity measures must be brought to an end. In difficult times like these, I also give my firm backing to the use of public procurement resources to promote local production.</p>
      <p sl="de">So, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, whoever it is sitting over there, I urge you to use the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council in December to tackle the issue of unemployment in a concerted manner in this context and to prevent a downward spiral, while counselling a joint new start for economic, employment and social policy. Be sure that the European Parliament will be very actively involved in the transatlantic dialogue between legislators. The Occupy Wall Street movement has not only earned the support of millions of Americans; it will, I hope, also act as an inspiration for the population of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, we must naturally approach US protectionist initiatives with caution and must take appropriate steps. However, I, too, would like to point out a different aspect of this American Jobs Act, namely, that it takes a radically different approach from what current European leaders are doing. We should pay attention to this and take it into account when drawing up plans for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Although Congress did not pass it at this point, the bill formulates diverse proposals which are important to us, for example, infrastructure investments that create jobs, the reduction of taxes on work, investment into education, this being based on the same recognition that we, too, have often pointed out, namely, that without education, there can be no real economic upturn, as well as helping job retention in the public sector, increasing the duration of unemployment benefits – as we know, unemployment benefits for many people in the US will expire in the near future – and the reduction of long-term unemployment through various means.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The package is based on the realisation that there is no better answer to deficit than economic growth, job creation, and support to education. This is a lesson that we, Europe’s leaders, should also learn. European decisions have so far been belated and weak. They in fact exacerbated and prolonged the crisis rather than actually mitigating it. The next European Council meeting will be of historic significance. The real question is whether a European investment and growth plan will be conceived, or if we will at least see some outlines of such a plan in the near future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the main difference between Mr Obama’s Presidency and the European institutions primarily boils down to his political will for a consumer-led recovery, incentivising investments in job-creating infrastructures, the use of monetary creation and taxation. He is also up against the conservatives who are blocking every single one of his plans. And your idea of a transatlantic pact is a fools’ deal, against our jobs, because free trade and competition will inevitably prevail.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore need to change and invent a new system for cooperation, including with the United States, which brings about border protection, change the role of the European Central Bank and the European banking system, replace the European Financial Stability Facility with an ecological Social Development Fund for investment, public services, education and employment, and to help small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

I agree completely with my colleague, Mr Caspary, who said that the Commission has to be far stronger, far more proactive, and, indeed, I would say far more aggressive in dealing with the situation. I read recently that the majority of Americans now think that their future lies with closer links in trade and in other relationships with Asia than with Europe and that might just tell us what they think of Europe and where we are going. Certainly the Commission will have to take up on the message that Mr Caspary is giving here today, otherwise we might find ourselves more and more marginalised in the world.</p>

It offers a reduction in taxes for companies which take on new workers, while also reducing salary taxes.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, the American Jobs Act offers an investment of more than USD 100 billion for public works, with the only proviso that materials produced or available in the US are used. This means that the provisions in question could restrict European companies from participating in infrastructure projects in the US.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, President Obama’s proposal for an American Jobs Act contains many elements and policy initiatives which sorely lack a European equivalent. However, conservative forces in the US Senate blocked their approval for two days in a stance paralleled in Europe by the austerity six-pack; our only approach to the severe economic crisis we find ourselves in. The ‘Buy American’ provisions enshrined in the American Jobs Act which emulates Obama’s approach in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is understandable in the face of US unemployment figures, but protectionism is not the way out of the economic woes afflicting both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through work in the Committee on the Internal Market and the EP Delegation to the US, I have emphasised the untapped benefits of further transatlantic market integration. There is much work to be done to improve network interoperability and to facilitate SMEs’ access to the transatlantic markets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, whilst I have doubts about the effectiveness of the American jobs bill – if it is enacted – it is heartening that the President understands the problem, if not the solution. President Obama, in his press conference announcing the bill, summed up the problem succinctly. In Maine, there is a bridge that is in bad shape, with bits falling off it. Meanwhile, there are millions of laid-off construction workers who could be busy rebuilding roads, bridges and schools. We nationalists have a saying: ‘whatever is physically possible must be financially possible. If it is not, the financial system is at fault’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any reflationary injection must be spent into circulation and must not be credit-created by the banks and lent into circulation. The problem with all such reflationary measures is that injections of money precede – sometimes by years – the resulting increase in GDP and are therefore inflationary. This effect might be reduced by partly deferred payments to recipients of reflationary spending.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the past 20 years have been a period of exceptional prosperity in Europe and America. However, the benefits of this almost uninterrupted economic growth have not been enjoyed equally by all. Rather than having a positive impact on combating poverty, they have resulted in increased social inequality. The problem has been further compounded by the current economic crises, the effects of which are being borne mainly by the lower classes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have suddenly reached the conclusion that the current financial disparity is nearly the same as it was prior to the economic crisis of the 1930s. The basic problem that we are facing is the question of how to stimulate our economy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to realise that economic development is generated not by millionaires but by ordinary consumers. This philosophy is reflected in the employment legislation proposed by Barack Obama. The bulk of new jobs are not created in jet aircraft factories, shipyards manufacturing luxury yachts or financial institutions speculating in global markets, but in enterprises that provide goods and services for mass consumers. It seems that any potential economic growth will be achieved not only through reducing budget expenditure but, first and foremost, through stimulating consumption. We should not worry about the fate of millionaires – they will succeed without our help. We should rather be concerned about those whose lives have been torn apart by the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first, I would like to apologise for changing the guards in the middle of your debate. This by no means represents disrespect on the part of the Commission for remarks made in the European Parliament. This change was necessary because Commissioner De Gucht is working on exactly what we have been discussing today, namely free trade in Korea, and my colleague, Mr Šemeta, had to go on an urgent trip to Moldova. But I would like to assure you that all your remarks and questions have been properly noted and that, if you are not satisfied with the answers I provide, I will be very happy to continue our discussion in written form.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the topic we have been discussing today, I would like to thank you very much for putting this very important issue on our European agenda. I think you are right: when it comes to protectionism, the Trade Barriers Commission has to behave very responsibly and very actively, which is exactly what we always try to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that you very rightly pointed out the specificity and importance of the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union. If we look at the size of the relationship and the size of the economy – and, as was rightly pointed out by one of the honourable Members, there is the feeling that the future of American trade lies with Asia – I always say: let us have a look at the real figures; let us have a look at how big the GDPs of all the big countries are. And you know that all of them together have a smaller GDP than the United States, and that the United States has a smaller GDP than the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, our trade relationship is a most robust one. It creates 15 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, our trade represents more than 400 billion in trade goods and more than EUR 260 billion in services and, if you look at mutual investment in mutual stock options, we are talking about more than EUR 2 trillion. So it is a very solid and robust trade relationship, and therefore it requires appropriate care.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we are investing a great deal of energy in TEC contacts and in TEC cooperation between the Commission and the United States, represented by the White House in this particular case. We know how much we can gain if we are able to remove just one of the barriers and how much we could lose if new barriers are erected. This is exactly the approach the Commission and Commissioner De Gucht will take at the upcoming very important negotiations, whether they be part of the EU-US Summit at the end of October or the subsequent TEC meeting, which should take place a day later.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to assure you that we remain in close contact with our American partners; that this issue, which was raised by several Members of the European Parliament, will be followed very closely; and that the Commission will do all that is necessary to defend the rights of EU businesses and EU job holders and to protect the good economic and business environment between the United States and the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The United States is also experiencing a serious economic and financial crisis at present and is seeking means of exiting the crisis as quickly as possible. The recent American Jobs Act is aimed at creating as many jobs as possible, returning to work people who have lost their jobs and investing as much money as possible in employment policy. This Act received support in Congress, and the United States expects the country’s economy to move forward. It is vital for the European Union that the United States economy should recover because it is one of the world’s most important economic markets. The European Parliament stresses that we need to overcome the existing barriers to global trade because we must strengthen transatlantic trade relations. The European Union itself must also combat the current ever-growing unemployment, poor working conditions, poverty and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, European consumers’ confidence in the financial system has been severely tested in the last few months, and the Belgian case is clear evidence of this. I am convinced that the system of compensating the potential losses of consumers in the event of bankruptcy of financial institutions or insurance companies, together with insurance guarantee schemes, could make a precious contribution to reducing the risks of policyholders and beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report. However, I would like to emphasise that, until now, European consumers have not had access to sufficient information in cases of insurance company insolvency. This information must be easily accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible, but, above all, consumers must be clearly told which authority they can apply to should they need to claim compensation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am glad that Parliament has finally adopted the amendments to Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process. These measures will revitalise trade with the Western Balkan countries and help their economies through privileged access to the EU market. In turn, economic development is to foster political stability in the entire region. It is in the EU’s interest to make efforts to mitigate the effect of the economic crisis on the Western Balkans.</p>
      <p sl="en">These amendments permit the extension of the regulation’s validity to 31 December 2015. It took the European Parliament a long time to adopt these extensions and that had unwanted consequences for trade relations with the poorest countries in the region, such as Kosovo. I hope that in future, the European Parliament will act more swiftly in such a situation, taking into consideration Parliament’s position on the integration of the region and efforts to improve economic relations with the countries of the Western Balkans.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the legal mechanism devised as a temporary solution for adapting the value-added tax (VAT) system to the abolition of the internal borders is showing its limitations and shortcomings. There is a high level of exposure to fraud, a problem that must be solved as soon as possible. Furthermore, if we think about the considerable increase in commercial transactions between tradespeople based in different Member States and about the rise in the provision of cross-border services, reform of the VAT system appears obvious and inevitable.</p>
      <p sl="it">I voted for Mr Casa’s report, but I still believe that the reverse charge mechanism needs to be explored further. In particular, we are not currently able to forecast what the effects would be of concentrating the financial risk exclusively on the retailer.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we had yesterday the published reform of the common agricultural policy; spending on the CAP is not going to be cut in absolute terms, and in proportionate terms, it is going to have a massive cut from 40% of the budget to 38 point something. My point is not to rehearse all of the manifold failings of that system: the wanton damage it does to developing countries, in Africa in particular; the ecological cataclysm that it has caused in Europe with the felling of hedgerows; the encouraging of pesticides and chemical fertilisers; or indeed the way in which it penalises the poor both through their taxes and through higher prices. My point is that such a system has shown itself to be incapable of reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">We delude ourselves when we think that we can get in and argue our case, and be reasonable, and change these bureaucracies and these mechanisms into something different from what they were set up to be. We have reached the point where there is no point in persuading ourselves that we need more treatment, more antibiotics. We have to face the reality that amputation is now the only way to save ourselves.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are many positive aspects to this report but I am afraid I was unable to support it for a number of reasons. Chief among them was paragraph 10, which calls for a standard harmonised or reduced VAT rate on all intra-EU cross-border travel, regardless of the mode of transport, and for harmonised rules on VAT deductibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">Derogations are an important element of the VAT Directive as they give Member States the necessary flexibility to address specific issues, and the continuing exemption on transport is vital for an island nation like Ireland. The cost of access for goods, and indeed for people, matter hugely to our economy and to ordinary individuals, so I think Member States need to have flexibility in shaping tax policies in order to meet their individual needs, and access to and from an island nation is certainly central to this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In regard to the continuing availability of zero and reduced VAT rates, that is an important issue for Ireland. But finally, I want to say that I fully support the reduction of red tape and fraud that this very good report otherwise deals with.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of this report because I think that value-added tax is very much a European tax. We should remember that, on this point, we really do need flexibility for the Member States. It is very important to remember that we should not, incidentally, start to bring taxation more into line with other Member States. Instead, each Member State should – as any independent country should – have the right to decide its own fiscal and economic policy, even if we have a system of open coordination within our internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A particular concern that I would like to raise, and which this report certainly refers to, but which should be emphasised more strongly, relates to voluntary work. Voluntary work, in whatever form, should not be liable to VAT or any other tax. We need people who are prepared to work for different NGOs, not-for-profit organisations, sports clubs, and so on. They are worth their weight in gold and important for us in European civil society. Therefore, it is particularly important to ensure that voluntary work, sports clubs and those active in civil society are not subject to any form of tax.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, first of all, I would like to say that I made a mistake during the voting for this report, I wanted to abstain but I voted against it because someone was speaking in my ear at the time. Therefore, if that could be corrected, I would be grateful to you.</p>
      <p sl="ga">However, the reason why I, Ms Harkin and other members were not able to fully support this report was because it refers to tax harmonisation, and it is a cause of controversy in our country. Even though it is a good objective, maybe, in the future, it is too soon for us and therefore, we abstained from the final vote instead of voting in favour of it as our group wanted us to do even though it is a very good report in general.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wonder whether in the middle of the fifth century, Roman philosophers and governors debated whether the solution to their problems was not more government, and more rapacious provincial governors, and higher taxes, and more uniformity and harmonisation, and, if necessary, the importation of Goths to do the work which it was no longer profitable for Romans to do. If they did, the evidence has been lost, but perhaps one day, scavenging over the remains of western civilisation, some future archaeologist might stumble upon the speech which the President of the European Commission gave yesterday, where he decided that the solution to Europe’s debt problems was more of what had caused it: more debt, more centralisation, higher taxes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given the magnitude of events that we are debating, all of these further agglomerations of power by central government do seem extraordinary. We are consigning this part of the world to utter economic irrelevance while on our borders, more virile nations are growing and taking up the slack. Altogether elsewhere, vast herds of reindeer move across miles and miles of golden moss, silently and very fast.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, let us be clear that the essence of any new plan by this Commission and Council will be the same as the last, which is bail-outs for the banks and savage austerity for working class people. What this means is seen in Ireland today, where you have the pathetic sight of an elected government jumping through hoops for the ringmaster, IMF’s A.J. Chopra, and an array of unelected IMF and EU bureaucrats. We also have the sight of Taoiseach Enda Kenny scurrying to Brussels to receive his orders from unelected Commission President Barroso. The orders are clear: increase the austerity and sell off more state assets. The indications now are that we will be faced with EUR 4 billion worth of cutbacks and a tax next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results of that austerity are just as clear. You can see it in Greece, where austerity has destroyed the economy, which is in freefall. In Ireland, despite the hype about improved economic performance, the reality is that domestic consumption and domestic investment continue to plummet, precisely as a result of that austerity. The spread of the occupying movement into Europe is a sign that young people – working-class people – are not prepared to accept it. We need to build those movements into a mass movement that can defeat austerity across Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I supported the resolution calling for a comprehensive plan to save the eurozone because I do think that we have to give a clear message to the Council to take fast, tough and decisive measures in relation to sovereign debt. I do think that we have to move forward to a more community method and fewer intergovernmental deals.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, when I read in the resolution that we call for a plan for an economic ‘government’ – rather than ‘governance’ – of the eurozone, I think that at least we have to ask ourselves the question: are we calling for a two-step Europe? With ‘a two-step Europe’, I mean that a part of Europe which is not yet reformed, the eurozone, will remain behind, and the rest of Europe that has reformed will go forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do think that it is very important that we call for what brings unity, cohesion and solidarity. We need common solutions for the eurozone because we have an integrated market. We have an integrated financial system, we have integrated banks. We need profound reforms in the Member States of the eurozone that have not done so. We have to have real market integration, complete the internal market and open up the internal market for services. We need more unity, more cohesion and more solidarity, not new divisions in Europe.</p>

We have to stand up for freedom of movement in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Freedom of movement is one of the cornerstones of the European Union. I am sure that both the Bulgarian and the Romanian authorities will take all their responsibilities and continue to be committed to putting in place and implementing the Schengen acquis .

      <p sl="it">I support this recommendation because I am in favour of greater cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde in the field of air services. It is absolutely crucial today to establish mutually supportive relationships between the Member States and third countries in order to guarantee greater efficiency and integration, which can serve to improve the aviation sector in the areas of tourism and trade. Therefore, I would stress the importance of replacing the traditional designation clauses with a single EU designation clause permitting all EU air carriers to benefit from the right of establishment in third countries. In the case in point, Cape Verde has, since 2002, signed eight bilateral agreements, the relevant provisions of which must be replaced or supplemented by the provisions of a single agreement. This would make air links more straightforward, transparent and effective.

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation, drafted by Mr Riquet, concerns a proposal for a decision of the Council regarding the conclusion of the agreement between the Union and Cape Verde on certain aspects of air services. Eight Member States – Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom – had bilateral agreements with Cape Verde, which were against the spirit of the EU with regard to standardisation of procedures, as ruled by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations and the agreement was signed on 23 March 2011. On 17 May 2011, the Council decided to submit the agreement to Parliament for approval. I therefore voted to conclude this agreement between the EU and the Republic of Cape Verde, since it will allow all European air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the Member States and this African country, as well as clarifying the rules on taxation of aviation fuel and on competition.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We are doubtful and concerned about the proposal to conclude an EU-Cape Verde agreement on certain aspects of air services, as to the consequences that might arise from it, bearing in mind the current framework of liberalisation and the resulting monopolistic concentration in the sector. As a direct result of ‘free competition’, which is held sacrosanct, the ability of the Member States to defend their flag carriers is being reduced.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The path of opening up the market has a clear impact on national air carriers, in a sector which is strategic for safeguarding national interests, for various reasons. In addition, this agreement seeks to replace some of the provisions relating to competition in the bilateral agreements concluded by certain Member States, including Portugal, with a single EU agreement, thus harmonising the range of requirements and permissions enabling air carriers to establish themselves in the territory of Cape Verde. In this way, it supersedes the specificities of the bilateral agreements of each Member State in this area.

      <p sl="sk">? In 2002, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that certain provisions of the existing bilateral agreements between the Member States and third countries in the field of air services conflicted with Article 49 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on non-discriminatory freedom of establishment which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State. There are also further issues where compliance with EU law should be ensured through amending or complementing existing provisions in bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries. Those provisions required compliance with EU law with a view to enabling all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to air routes between the EU and these third countries. Therefore, in June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with these third countries on the replacement of the relevant provisions at Union level. In the case of Cape Verde, the provisions of the agreement supersede or complement the existing provisions in the eight bilateral air services agreements between EU Member States and the Republic of Cape Verde. The agreement will serve a fundamental objective of the external aviation policy of the European Union by bringing existing bilateral air services agreements into line with EU law.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this important report. The aim of insurance guarantee schemes (IGS) is to give consumers protection in cases where insurance undertakings are no longer able to fulfil their contractual commitments. Under these schemes, people will be protected against the risk that claims will not be met if their insurance company becomes insolvent. IGSs differ frequently in coverage, which results in heterogeneous levels of policyholder protection between Member States. The lack of harmonised IGS arrangements in the EU hinders effective and equal consumer protection and impedes the functioning of the internal insurance market. Consequently, there is a loss of consumer confidence, market stability is put at risk and cross-border competition is distorted. I agree that, in light of the lessons drawn from the recent crisis, we must develop harmonised IGSs in order to remedy existing shortcomings and restore consumer confidence. National and European Supervisory Authorities, in particular, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), must consistently apply sound prudential rules and effective supervision ensuring a high level of consumer protection and the proper functioning of the insurance market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">A directive for harmonising the terms for protecting insurance consumers is designed to protect all Europeans, in the event of the insurer going bankrupt, from the complications which could arise, depending on the insurer’s country of origin, from fraud or mis-selling or from the failure of the guarantee schemes. The scheme for providing additional, standard protection to those using the insurance instrument must be designed according to the principle of subsidiarity. Insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) are regarded as an instrument for reducing the risks facing insurance policyholders in the event of an insurance company going bankrupt. The European Parliament has demonstrated its support for a common EU-level approach on more than one occasion. The issue of IGSs is obviously complex due to the extensive variety of existing schemes in EU Member States and to the interaction between IGSs, as well as to other aspects currently being examined at EU level, the most important being the imminent introduction of the Solvency II Directive. This will radically change the European insurance industry.

The information available to consumers in case of insurer insolvency should be easily accessible, comprehensible and easy to follow. Setting up a single point of contact for all financial guarantee schemes ensures that the existing legislation really benefits consumers, especially as regards providing information and facilitating cross-border contact and payments.</p>

      <p sl="it">Developing an effective policy on insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) and implementing it correctly from a methodological point of view is a delicate and complex task, especially given that no mechanism exists to compensate consumers for the losses suffered in the insurance market. It is delicate, because applying it superficially is liable to affect consumer confidence; and it is complex, because the widely adopted parameters may not necessarily work for all the Member States. The Commission should therefore be commended for its work on this subject, because it has combined methodological rigour with the flexibility that is needed. Creating a subsidiary role for IGSs at national level so as to offer greater guarantees to consumers shows sensitivity and is evidence of a high degree of professionalism. The cross-border standardisation directive for IGSs demonstrates a very broad and consistent outlook, and puts the Commission in the position of guarantor of the consistency of the common insurance guarantee scheme. Therefore, it is particularly important to ensure that this image is not obscured in any way. I believe that special attention will have to be paid to transparency when information is exchanged: in the event of the insolvency of an insurer, having a coherent single point of contact for all financial guarantees will ensure that the directive genuinely benefits consumers.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The principal goal of this own-initiative report is the protection of the European consumer and the increased integration of the internal market. The text proposes a series of elements strengthening insurance guarantee schemes in Europe. The current context of economic, financial and budgetary crisis has demonstrated that public confidence in the financial system can easily be shaken if there is not an appropriate compensation process to remedy losses incurred by the public as consumers of financial products. I therefore believe, firstly, that these are appropriate and necessary measures that reinforce confidence in the insurance system and, therefore, in the entire European financial system in general. Secondly, I believe they represent another small step in the continuous process of European integration. We must not waver from this objective, even for a second, if we aspire to a Europe in peace that enjoys greater justice, prosperity and solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I eagerly await the proposal to be tabled by the Commission on this issue, and believe that this report could and should make a significant contribution to the architecture of a future European directive on insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs). I agree with the rapporteur’s choice of the four priorities to be dealt with by a future directive: ensuring consumer protection in the event of the bankruptcy of an insurer; ensuring equal consumer protection regardless of the ‘home’ state of the insurer; ensuring consumer protection in the event of fraud or mis-selling; and ensuring tax-payer protection in the event of IGS failure. All of this is to come from a minimum harmonisation directive that ensures a level of consumer protection. Finally, I would stress the importance of IGSs with regard to reducing risk in cases of insurer bankruptcy, and would emphasise the importance this directive will have for the success of the Solvency II Directive.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In July 2010, the European Commission published its White Paper on Insurance Guarantee Schemes (IGSs), which included a range of measures, in particular, as regards bankruptcy. This is quite an important issue, not just because of the need to bring to an end the great variety of systems existing in the various Member States, but also because of the interaction between IGSs and other issues under consideration in the EU; in particular, the Solvency II Directive, which will come into force in 2013 and will reduce the risk of insurer bankruptcy to one in 200. This report by Mr Skinner is based on the Commission proposals. In these disturbed times of global economic and financial crisis, it is essential that these measures be implemented as soon as possible, so as to increase the confidence of European consumers, who should be better informed on this issue. I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted.</p>

This is a very sensitive area, where what is being sought in the name of defending consumer rights and confidence is, at times, the deepening of the workings of the internal market in the field of financial services.

      <p sl="sk">Insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) provide last-resort protection to consumers when insurance undertakings are unable to fulfil their contractual commitments. They thus protect people against the risk that claims will not be met if their insurance company becomes insolvent. They frequently differ in coverage, however, which results in heterogeneous levels of policyholder protection between Member States. There are also significant differences in other aspects that affect the scope of the protection provided, and also in operational procedures and funding arrangements The lack of harmonisation hinders effective and equal consumer protection, which may lead to a loss of consumer confidence in the relevant markets and may ultimately jeopardise market stability. It may also impede the functioning of the internal insurance market by distorting cross-border competition. The development of harmonised IGSs could, however, help to remedy the existing deficiencies. In order to maintain consumer confidence in both the insurance industry and the single market for financial services, in my opinion, a consistent level of protection for consumers of all types of insurance products should be ensured. Consumers should be confident that all types of insurance products they buy are covered by an insurance guarantee scheme, and that this insurance guarantee scheme will guarantee that they receive 100% compensation within a set time period which is consistent across the EU.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Against the background of the financial crisis, Europe’s citizens face increasingly serious risks linked to the possibility of financial and insurance institutions going bankrupt. I supported this resolution because I think that consumer confidence must be preserved and the insurance guarantee schemes must become more secure. This would also help stimulate cross-border competition and speed up the development of the insurance market in the EU. I share the view that effective, proportionate supervision is required from national and European supervisory bodies, along with better cooperation. Member States’ involvement in carrying out tests on the insurance guarantee schemes and in exchanging information, if the competent authorities detect problems in an insurance company, is important for improving coordination and confidence in the system. I also support the measures promoting greater transparency and awareness among consumers. They need to clearly understand what happens if the insurer possibly becomes insolvent and the risks relating to this. This information should be easily accessible, easy to understand and comprehensive, with a single point of contact established to facilitate this process. Furthermore, consumers should not suffer any losses if the regulatory bodies fail to supervise the insurers appropriately.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) are considered a valuable tool in reducing the risks facing policyholders in the event of the failure of an insurance company. A wide range of IGSs currently exist in the Member States, offering varying degrees of consumer protection across various product lines on the basis of various funding models, and the lack of harmonised IGSs at European level and the diverse regimes among Member States have therefore led to ineffective and uneven protection for insurance policyholders and have slowed down the functioning of the insurance market by distorting cross-border competition. Consumer trust in the functioning of the internal market in financial services can only be assured by a consistent level of consumer protection regardless of the origin of the service provider, primarily through the consistent application of sound prudential rules and effective supervision by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and, where appropriate, competent national authorities. The Commission is urged to come forward with proposals for a cross-border standardisation directive establishing a coherent and consistent cross-border framework for IGSs across Member States. The most important thing for us should be to protect consumers from losses in the event of the failure of insurance companies, and for this reason and the others mentioned above, I welcomed this document.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Skinner’s text because I believe that European legislation in the field of insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) is necessary, but should, at the same time, be considered and analysed carefully because of the recessionary effects it could have on the market. While it is true that protecting customers who take out a policy to cover the risk of an insurer going bankrupt should be a priority of ours, it is equally true that IGSs should insure a wide range of national and, above all, European markets at a time of economic crisis. I believe that the text of this resolution is along those very lines and seeks to combine these two aspects through an approach that does not undermine the protection already guaranteed by some Member States. The protection of consumers from the risk of the insolvency of insurers must be guaranteed through measures that are effective in preventing risks to customers and that, at the same time, ensure that insurers, too, have the flexibility to operate in the free market.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs) represent consumers’ final protection in cases where insurance companies are unable to meet their contractual obligations. It is a tragic fact that of the 30 countries making up the EU-EEA, only 12 have at least a general insurance guarantee scheme. This means that if an insurance company goes bankrupt, one third of the entire insurance market in the EU-EEA is not covered by any guarantee. Since this represents 26% of life insurance policies and 56% of general insurance policies, I consider that European citizens should benefit from IGSs to protect them against the risk of compensation claims not being honoured by insurance companies which have declared insolvency.</p>

      <p sl="it">The need for greater consumer protection and guarantees, particularly in the light of the recent financial crisis, has been proven to apply to the insurance market, too, especially when an insurer goes bankrupt. Insurance guarantee schemes, or IGSs, serve precisely to insure people against possible risks. This report proposes greater harmonisation of IGSs at European level so as to cover the risks that may arise in the event of cross-border insurer default. It is right to adopt the ‘home’ country principle in order to apply supervisory measures, but the EIOPA, the European authority created for the very purpose of supervising the European insurance system, should also play a key role. Consumers are very much central to this report, with numerous references to greater consumer protection and guarantees. For all these reasons, I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution because a consistent and harmonised framework of rules on insurance guarantees must function at European Union level, abolishing different regimes across the Member States. It should be pointed out that an insurance guarantee scheme is an effective measure which reduces the risks facing policyholders, and guarantees varying degrees of consumer protection and effective cross-border competition. Consequently, it is very important to ensure that European rules provide for a high and appropriate level of protection. Given the fact that many consumers lose some or all of their assets and find themselves in poverty due to the failure of insurance companies, I believe that it is appropriate to consolidate the ‘home’ country principle, under which the burden of responsibility for failure should be borne by the ‘home’ IGS. Only then will people be protected against the risk that claims will not be met if their insurance company becomes insolvent. It should be noted that this principle, as a last-resort consumer protection measure, must only be applied in exceptional cases when insurance undertakings are unable to fulfil their contractual commitments owing to insolvency and when other regulatory instruments have been exhausted.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Skinner’s report, to which I also contributed as part of my work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by tabling a series of amendments. I believe that, in line with what has already been done for the banks and investment companies, EU-level insurance guarantee schemes should be implemented in the insurance sector, too. However, it is my opinion that, while the basic principle may be the same, it is important to adapt and tailor the measures to the sector in question, given its specific characteristics. For example, the scope should exclude third-party motor insurance policies that already have a mandatory fund that provides cover and be restricted to life insurance products, since they require greater protection as long-term products that are often intended for people of retirement age. Furthermore, I believe it is essential to link the creation of insurance guarantee funds to the prudential rules laid down by the Solvency II Directive, which still needs to be implemented in full. I hope that the Commission will take these suggestions on board when it presents the legislative proposal in the future.</p>

Nonetheless, the Commission proposal still does not specifically focus on the issues of consumer protection in the event of the bankruptcy of an insurer, of consumer protection regardless of the insurer’s state of origin and of safeguarding citizens in the event of fraud or abusive policies from an insurance product.

To ensure consumer confidence both in the insurance sector and in the single market in insurance services, a consistent level of protection for consumers of all types of insurance products must be guaranteed.

I consider it important that tests be carried out on the IGSs of the various European countries, which will help to detect any potential problems at national level. Small and concentrated markets that find it hard to obtain adequate funding for the activities of an IGS, which could give rise to dangerous systemic risks, should be taken into account. Finally, I would argue that all information should be easily available to consumers, so that they are fully aware of the various forms of protection from potential insurer insolvency, and of how the continuity of insurance contracts is ensured in situations of portfolio transfer.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on insurance guarantee schemes because European consumers need to be protected in the event of insurer default. In order to ensure a high level of consumer protection in the event of insurer default, a European framework must be set up to allow a choice between receiving financial compensation for the investment made in the insurance policy and continuing the insurance contracts by portfolio transfer. I should emphasise how important it is to increase consumers’ knowledge and awareness of financial services and the associated risks. A mechanism needs to be introduced for insurance policies to include clear warnings about the risks associated with them and the options which consumers have in these cases. We call on the Commission to take measures aimed at setting up a common, coherent and consistent insurance guarantee framework to provide total, permanent protection for insurance policyholders throughout the EU. Furthermore, in the case of insurance policies too, consumer protection authorities must endorse the framework contracts offered by insurers, so that consumers are protected and informed about their rights and obligations and can have some negotiating power when taking out an insurance policy.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Only a few Member States have insurance guarantee schemes (IGSs). The rapporteur reminds us that the lack of harmonisation in this area at Community level hinders effective and equal consumer protection. This may have an impact on consumer confidence, ultimately threatening market stability. Consumer protection is a very important issue for Lithuania. The latest World Bank report states that, in my country, legislation concerning consumer protection in the area of financial services is not implemented uniformly. A Eurobarometer survey on consumer protection in Europe has shown that Lithuanian consumers need a better consumer protection programme. There also needs to be additional funding in order to ensure that the Lithuanian Consumer Association works more effectively. There are more than 20 consumer associations operating in Lithuania, but only a few in the area of financial services. Some consumer associations receive limited funding from the government, but that is not enough. Government funding should be supplemented with funding provided by European agencies or bilateral agreements with established European consumer associations. Measures aimed at improving consumer protection and financial literacy must be pragmatic and effective and give consumers rights. They should include giving consumers information about improving financial services and promoting market transparency. In the case of Lithuania, this also means strengthening the functions of the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority by implementing legislation concerning consumer protection in the area of financial services.</p>

This report looks to strengthen consumer protection in four main areas: ensuring consumers are protected in the event of bankruptcy; ensuring the equal treatment of consumers regardless of the country of the insurer; ensuring that there is sufficient cover for consumers in cases of fraud; and making sure that the taxpayer does not become liable for the bankruptcy of an insurer. This protection will apply to all types of insurance policy and provides protection from the gung-ho attitude of some financial institutions with the public’s money.</p>

Currently, the VAT system in the EU is fragmented, where tariffs vary and various exceptions are in force, which distorts competition in the internal market and creates conditions for fraud. Every year, massive losses are incurred by Member States as a result of VAT fraud, possibly amounting to EUR 100 billion.

Simplifying VAT will help businesses and Member States alike to reduce bureaucratic procedures and administrative formalities. Other positive elements are the proposal to introduce a Europe-wide VAT exemption threshold for SMEs, again with a view to cutting red tape and costs, and the encouragement for national administrations to use electronic systems in order to facilitate cross-border transactions and bureaucratic procedures in the area of VAT.

However, the financial crisis affecting the whole euro area obliges us to re-examine the taxation system, too, and to move towards a standard, neutral accounting system. First and foremost, this would deliver greater efficiency and simplification, but, at the same time, it would ensure a necessary reduction of the administrative burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises. Uneven taxation in the internal market makes our companies less competitive, and they are the backbone of the European economy. It is also liable to create worrying tax evasion, particularly in cross-border transactions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The internal market is a crucial tool for a competitive EU. A common value-added tax (VAT) system is essential if it is to function effectively. A comprehensive VAT system should reduce operational costs for users and administrative charges for authorities while combating fraud, which is a considerable burden on public finances and on consumers. The VAT exemption threshold for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) varies from one Member State to the next and applies at national level only. In order for the European Union to promote the growth of SMEs – which represent 99% of all businesses – and take advantage of the opportunities and benefits afforded by the single market, it is important for the Commission and the Member States to consider adopting a Europe-wide VAT exemption threshold for SMEs, with a view to cutting red tape and costs and ensuring access to the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="it">The hope for the future is that a new VAT system, together with the taxation of financial transactions, will, as the Commission claims, become an important own resource for the European budget. In the meantime, we invite the Commission to act quickly and to continue along its chosen path to the end, actively encouraging Member States to put in place all the necessary preliminary conditions in order to avoid multiple and overlapping elements and to allow for smoother bureaucratic procedures and reduced administration costs.</p>

Combating VAT fraud is also a priority because it is estimated that this fraud totals EUR 100 billion. VAT receipts represent more than 21% of the Member States’ tax revenue, demonstrating that they are an important source of revenue for national budgets; in many of them, it is even the main source of revenue. Companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), cannot bear the administrative costs that they incur by charging VAT. It is worth noting that SMEs represent more than 99% of companies and around 67.4% of jobs in the EU. In Portugal, SMEs represent 81.4% of the total number of jobs. As regards countries in receipt of outside help, I believe there should be particular and substantial solidarity towards them, since the EU cannot impose tax rises on them whilst simultaneously going ahead with harmonisation and exemptions.</p>

Any such improvements require a comprehensive VAT system that can adapt to changes in the economic and technological environment. A simpler VAT system would also reduce the operational cost to taxpayers and tax administrations, thereby increasing the net benefit to the Treasury. Moreover, the key role of businesses in collecting VAT must be properly recognised, since VAT is a consumption tax and not a tax on businesses. VAT compliance costs are a major administrative burden for EU companies and reducing this burden would contribute significantly to increasing their competitiveness. These are the main challenges the EU is facing in the field of VAT. Consultation with stakeholders and businesses should take place and these parties should participate in the preparation and implementation of legislation in the field of VAT at EU and national level in order to ensure its uniform implementation throughout the EU and in order to create legal certainty.</p>

We therefore support the Commission’s initiative to recognise the status quo and move towards a destination principle. A VAT system based on the place of establishment of the customer, for both goods and services, appears to be a promising route, but this needs to be accompanied by the introduction of well-functioning one-stop shops by Member States, in order to avoid multiple VAT registrations, increased compliance costs and negative cash flow effects for businesses operating internationally.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Value-added tax (VAT), in addition to duty, is an important instrument for collecting revenue and has made a considerable contribution to reducing budget deficits during the current crisis.

      <p sl="hu">Commission action is needed in the interest of European citizens. VAT is an instrument that enables us to lighten the burdens of our citizens and SMEs, and to create an effective internal market. The reduction of administrative burdens, the use of template-based European invoicing and the coordination of the current system of disparate European practices are all necessary. Through these, we can promote entrepreneurship among citizens, the growth of SMEs and the emergence of new markets. Europe and its citizens need a European VAT concept that is more transparent, efficient, yet flexible and supportive to growth. Any reform of the current regulations needs to focus on the fight against cross-border tax fraud, too, because governments make up for the loss of tax revenues caused by such fraud to the detriment of Europe’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Once the VAT system becomes more transparent, consumers will be able to make better decisions in the light of more accurate information. This will mean an enhanced ability to plan and increased security and prosperity for the SME sector and for our citizens. In the spirit of the report, harmonisation among countries could commence without Member States giving up their fiscal autonomy. In adopting the report, we have sent the Commission a message about our political support. The message is clear and unambiguous, and I hope that the Commission will also act in this spirit.

      <p sl="pt">The system of value-added tax (VAT) covers the entire EU. Indeed, as it is a tax on consumption and as the EU is characterised by the free movement of goods, services and businesses, there is a need for an EU-level approach, minor national variations notwithstanding. As such, the Commission has proposed applying the destination principle; that is, applying – wherever there are differences – the rules of the purchaser’s location. However, the overriding concern is to reduce inefficiencies in the administrative machine, for example, by reducing the frequency of the periodic VAT returns, or by simplifying the evidence required for exempting exports from VAT. Finally, it is also important to find means of collection suited to improving the efficiency of the system and reducing fraud. The future of VAT that we are attempting to design here must involve two things: simplicity and efficiency. I voted in favour for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="it">I congratulate Mr Casa on his excellent work. The text that has been adopted is the European Parliament’s response to the Commission’s Green Paper on the future of VAT, published in December 2010, and is a contribution to the drafting of the future European strategy on the future of VAT, which is expected for the end of this year. The main objective of this report is to strike a balance between maintaining VAT revenues at the levels necessary to provide a major source of income, and ensuring that those revenues do not stifle entrepreneurial activities. This could be achieved, first and foremost, by combating fraud (which currently costs the European Union EUR 100 billion in lost revenue) and reducing the plethora of different exemptions and rates. Furthermore, the intelligent development of new VAT systems at EU level would make life easier for honest entrepreneurs and would help non-profit making organisations in the supply of goods and services. In line with this text, I call on the Commission and the Member States to consider introducing a Europe-wide VAT exemption threshold for SMEs, with a view to cutting red tape and costs and facilitating access to the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="et">I voted in favour of the report on the future of value-added tax. In view of the important role of value-added tax in the harmonisation of differences in taxation, in the development of a common internal market and in reducing bureaucracy, and in order to safeguard Member States’ value-added tax revenues, I am glad that we were able to consider this topic. I believe that this report, which examines the modification of the value-added tax system, is important because it offers a solution to the problem that has arisen in the transport sector, offering equal opportunities to all modes of transport. Member States should ensure that similar goods and services receive like treatment in the application of value-added tax, and should also ensure that value-added tax is applied uniformly to different cross-border transport services, regardless of the mode of transport. The situation whereby some modes of transport, for instance, bus and train transport, are subject to value-added tax, while air transport and shipping are exempt, creates unequal conditions for the provision of these same cross-border transport services. Considering that 99% of entrepreneurs in the European Union are small and medium-sized enterprises, this is also of great importance in the reduction of the administrative burdens of SMEs. The report states that administrative burdens should be reduced by 25% by 2012. I sincerely hope that Member States will accept the amendments in question.</p>

      <p sl="it">It is imperative to review the VAT system, which was introduced more than 40 years ago, since the structure of trade in favour of an increase in cross-border transactions has shown the limitations of the system as well as the huge scope for fraud that may result from it. For my part, I hope that the legislative proposal will aim to further simplify the system in order to reduce administrative burdens for businesses (in large part due to VAT formalities) and especially for small businesses, of which there are a very large amount in my country: 4 335 448 (99.9% of all businesses). It is therefore essential to strengthen the simplification measures through the use of harmonised VAT return models, special schemes for small businesses and micro businesses, and the development of the one-stop shop. In the case of intra-Community transactions, the Commission has declared its willingness to definitively abandon the objective of taxation in the country of origin in favour of destination-based taxation. This mechanism would have the benefit of preventing some types of fraud. However, small retailers are siding against the proposal, as it would mean abolishing the system of fractionated VAT payments (one of the main benefits of the current system), and hence concentrating the financial risk on traders, who would have to pay the full amount of VAT to the public treasury.</p>

The report calls on Member States to coordinate and harmonise administrative practices relating to VAT, and implement measures to reduce the administrative burdens caused by VAT, reduce the frequency of regular VAT returns and simplify the proof required for a VAT export exemption. E-invoicing helps reduce payment delays, the risk of errors and fraud, as well as administrative costs. Directive 2010/45/EU on the common system of value-added tax as regards the rules on invoicing sets out new VAT rules for e-invoicing, thereby ensuring equal treatment for paper and e-invoices. According to COM(2009)15 on reducing administrative burdens, applying the same VAT rules to both paper and e-invoices will reduce the administrative burden on companies by up to EUR 18 million in the medium term. In the transport sector, there has been a call for harmonised regulations or a reduced VAT rate for cross-border transport within the EU, as well as for making information accessible about the different VAT rates applied in the passenger transport sector, so as to inform passengers about the exact cost of their cross-border journey.</p>

The bureaucratic burden on companies in this area has become intolerable. This is a priority if we want to make the European internal market appealing again. Next, the process of EU integration requires increased convergence, and VAT must set the example. It is absolutely necessary to do away with any disparities that may currently exist between Member States, in order to put a stop to unhealthy competition that tends to be rife. The two cornerstones of this reform will increase the stability, growth and prosperity of the EU common market, making it more appealing and improving legal certainty.

Should this not be enough to fit the profile of a candidate required to carry out an extremely important role, which may legitimately be the case, the questionnaire contained in the proposal enables one to analyse in greater depth the ideas, values and possible strategic decisions that the candidate is ready to put into practice when carrying out his role within the ECB. I therefore believe that Mr Asmussen is a perfect fit for the role that he will have to carry out and for the institution that he will represent in his relations with the institutions and the media. At a time of economic and financial upheaval, it is increasingly important for the ECB to be perceived as a strong banking institution that has a clear political and economic position and that safeguards European interests, as has been the case until now.</p>

I hope that the Council gives the necessary approval as soon as possible, not least to send a message of cohesion and unity. I should like to take this opportunity to commend the ECB for what it has done, and is still doing, to maintain the stability of the euro and of the entire European Union. Were it not for the wisdom and the effectiveness of its actions during this crisis, I am not sure whether the Member States, particularly those in the euro area, would have had the ability and the strength to withstand and endure so much financial upheaval on their own. Fortunately, the ECB, in accordance with the Treaties and with its mandate, stepped in without hesitation, demonstrating a European spirit that should serve as a model for the other EU institutions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In addition to its core mission of financing investment in the European Union, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has, since 1963, undertaken financing operations outside the European Union in support of the EU's external policies. This allows the EU budget funds available to the external regions to be complemented by the financial strength of the EIB for the benefit of beneficiary countries. With a view to supporting the Union’s external action, and in order to enable the EIB to finance investments outside the Union without affecting its credit standing, the majority of its operations in external regions have benefited from an EU budgetary guarantee administered by the Commission. EIB financing operations should contribute to the general principles guiding the EU’s external action, as referred to in Article 21 of the Treaty on the European Union, of promoting and consolidating democracy and the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to the implementation of international environmental agreements to which the EU is party. It is my view that, in accordance with the objective of enhancing the coherence of overall EU support in the regions concerned, opportunities should be sought to combine EIB financing with EU budgetary resources as and when appropriate. It is necessary to have an early exchange of views between the EIB, the Commission and the European External Action Service in the process of preparing programming documents in order to maximise synergies between EIB activities and those of the Commission.</p>

Crucially, Parliament has also secured an increase of EUR 1 billion for investments in the southern Mediterranean (such as improving infrastructure and offering credit to private enterprise).

      <p sl="cs">The European Investment Bank (EIB), in addition to its basic role of financing investment in the EU, is also involved in providing loans outside the EU, which amounted to EUR 9 billion at the end of 2010, or about 12% of total loans. The European Parliament (EP) addressed the topic of the EIB on 17 February 2011 within the framework of the approved Resolution P7_TA-PROV(2011)0062 , which I also supported, including the five motions for amendment. The most important amendments relate to increasing the ceilings by EUR 1.857 billion and EIB reinvestments, EU goals and their cross-compliance in accordance with Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Paris Declaration of 2005 and the Accra Agenda for Action of 2008, as well as transparency and reporting – emphasising, for example, impact analyses in respect of development, environmental and social sustainability, and the performance indicators drawn up by the EIB in the area of development, the environment and human rights, etc. – and the more long term prospects concerning, for example, the provision of micro-credit based on the new financial framework. The proposed broader mandate of the EIB should enable better coordination in achieving EU objectives, greater responsibility and transparency and the better use of EU budgetary guarantees. Overall, it can be said that the report submitted by Ivailo Kalfin builds on previous EP decisions, and reflects the proposed changes, and I therefore recommend it for approval in the version submitted.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this text because, when viewed as a whole, it allows for the European Investment Bank’s mandate to be extended and for the Bank to be endowed with greater operational capacity with the aim of achieving the objectives set by the European Union. As a result, it will be possible to ensure more transparency and better use of the EU budgetary guarantee. On the basis of the findings of the mid-term review, it is now necessary to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee for EIB external financing until 2013.</p>

      <p sl="de">The European Investment Bank (EIB), the shareholders of which are the EU Member States, is one of the most important financial instruments of the EU. Its lending outside the EU represented more than 12% of its total 2010 lending. Based on the findings of a mid-term review, the objective was to ensure the continuation of the EU guarantee for EIB external financing for the remainder of the current financial perspectives 2007-2013, whilst introducing a number of new elements in the mandate.

      <p sl="lt">The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established in 1990 to support the development of market economies from Central Europe to Central Asia following the widespread collapse of communist regimes. The European Union, together with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and 40 countries (including all EU Member States at that time), were founding members. The EBRD is currently owned by 61 countries, the EU and the EIB. The EBRD supports projects in 29 countries, primarily in the private sector, that cannot be financed by the market.

      <p sl="it">I voted resolutely against this report on the subscription by the European Union to additional shares in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD, which coordinates development projects in around 30 countries in Eastern Europe and Asia, has, in fact, launched 44 projects in Turkey, too. In view of the threats, including military threats, that the Turkish Government has recently made against the EU and its Member States, and given that that same government is responsible for daily attacks on democracy, on the rights of religious minorities and on the freedom of expression, there is no way I can support the initiative in question. Similarly, the EBRD coordinates projects in countries such as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the government of which is not only responsible for attacks on the freedom of expression, but is also a key player in cases of corruption and clientelism, as well as a promoter of unacceptable historical falsehoods. I therefore voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="it">The increase in capital from EUR 20 to EUR 30 billion, not least to guarantee the AAA rating of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), is a very important commitment which must be supported. Therefore, EU representatives within the EBRD’s governing bodies must encourage greater alignment with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, thereby ensuring greater effectiveness of the EBRD’s external policy. The institution will have to provide transparent information to the public regarding its financing activities, and evaluations of projects and beneficiaries will be made public, leading to more frequent and tighter controls which will put paid to the secrecy surrounding the list of beneficiaries. In order to pursue the principle of transparency, the Governor of the EBRD will be required to report annually on the promotion of EU external policy objectives and Europe 2020 strategy objectives. This will ensure a more effective system and prevent duplication of investments by the European Investment Bank and the EBRD. I voted in favour for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this proposal because I believe that subscribing to additional shares following the increase in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is a necessary move in order to maintain the Bank’s rating. This increase also responds to the need to create a safety buffer in the event of a future negative development in the Bank’s investment portfolio. I believe it is important to support this policy given the central role that the institution plays in ensuring the stability of the financial sector and in providing a rapid response in economic crisis situations. Therefore, this operation calls for an assessment/rationalisation of the European investment banking system and for greater cooperation between banks belonging to the system itself. It is also important for the Governor of the EBRD to consider how this request fits in with other very important policies for the EU, such as the EU 2020 strategy and the EU’s Millennium Development Goals.</p>

      <p sl="ro">With regard to the subscription for additional callable shares in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in proportion with the EU’s current share, I think that increasing the capital will boost the institution’s activities in its countries of operation. In light of the financial crisis, it will increase the bank’s opportunities for granting the necessary assistance to those countries’ economies at a time of restricted capital availability. In this respect, I welcome the fact that the EBRD approved loans to Romania amounting to EUR 799 million for the 2009-2010 period. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and European Investment Bank are financed by the European Union, which entails the risk of their activities overlapping. I believe that the EU needs to exert tighter control over this, both so that it can verify the route taken by the loans granted and combat tax evasion, especially in view of the possible movement of EBRD funds via tax havens and the illegal use of the principle of banking secrecy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In May, the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) decided to increase its capital from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion.

The proposal is to generate new callable capital by transforming accumulated distributable reserves into share capital, so it will have no immediate effect on the EU budget. I am voting for this report as I consider it an important measure in helping to reverse the current economic and financial situation in Europe. The injection of additional liquidity into the EBRD will enable the bank’s activities to be stepped up and developed. Although Parliament wanted to go further, I nevertheless welcome the agreement that has been reached by the trialogue on tabling a report by the end of the fourth Capital Resources Review, which assesses the banking system for European public investment and also examines the possibility of restructuring the banks in question, as previously requested by Parliament.</p>

Essentially, the EBRD supports the development of the local sector: small and medium-sized enterprises, individuals, towns, regional cooperation, innovation, job creation, energy, environmental projects, and so on. This report, drafted by Ms Bowles, concerns the proposal for a decision by Parliament and the Council on the subscription by the EU to additional shares in the capital of the EBRD, in proportion with the Union’s current 3.031% share in the capital. I agree with and welcome this subscription, with the EU’s increase in capital for the EBRD, as it is an example of the EU’s economic capacity as a shareholder, and I hope that some of this capital will be used to support the development of the countries involved in the so-called ‘Arab Spring’.</p>

Indeed, I maintain that the EBRD, like the rest of the European Investment Bank (EIB), cannot provide financing for a country that does not respect the territorial sovereignty of an EU Member State and that even threatens the EU itself. I am referring, of course, to the age-old question of relations between Cyprus and Turkey. The European Union should send a strong message to Turkey, suspending all financing until the Cyprus question is resolved. We cannot and must not accept vetoes and ultimatums from Ankara, as was the case a few days ago on the issue of the future Cypriot Presidency of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed this resolution because it is appropriate to permit the European Union to subscribe for additional callable shares in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), in proportion with the Union’s current capital share. Attention should be drawn to the fact that EU participation in the EBRD’s capital is an efficient means of contributing to the implementation of EU objectives, of helping to mitigate the impact of the crisis in the EBRD’s countries of operation, and of sustaining a high level of activity by the EBRD. It should be noted that this operation will not have an immediate direct effect on the EU budget because the aim is to generate the new paid-in capital by transforming accumulated distributable reserves into share capital. In addition, this capital subscription would not require any actual cash payments from the EU budget unless there should be very serious and unforeseen losses. I believe that there is no reason to doubt the bank’s financial sustainability because the EBRD has significant experience of successful operations, pursues a responsible lending policy, and retains good financial ratios.</p>

      <p sl="it">At this historic time, the proposal adopted just now on increasing the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is something that I have no qualms in supporting. The European Union joined the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in the 1990s and, as the years have gone by, the governors of the EBRD have seen fit to double its capital. The EU has subscribed to more than 30 000 shares, though its share of the total capital has remained unchanged. Last May, in order to tackle the crisis, the Council decided to increase the EBRD’s capital from EUR 20 billion to EUR 30 billion, which seemed like a good starting point for providing fresh impetus and offered a robust response at a time of major speculation. Furthermore, the future work of the EBRD will be essential for putting project bonds into action.</p>

At present, the EBRD’s capital stock is held by the EU, the European Investment Bank and 61 countries.

I voted for this report because the EBRD will be able to increase its activities in its countries of operation, to ensure support for new markets, to encourage greater cooperation with other European financial institutions, and to implement the best prudential banking practices. I would also stress the importance of adopting mechanisms for monitoring the European banking system, of achieving the Union’s foreign policy objectives, and of it being possible for the EU to keep the same number of votes in the EBRD.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Lithuania and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are bound by close cooperation. According to EBRD data, our cooperation covers 78 projects with a total value of EUR 1.8 billion and a net turnover of EUR 590.6 million. I believe that it would be helpful for the EU to sign the decision on these additional shares in the capital of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), particularly given that this will have no immediate direct effect on the EU budget. The objective of the proposed legislation is to permit the EU to subscribe for additional callable shares in EBRD countries, in proportion with the EU’s current share of the capital. This decision would enable the EBRD to increase its activities in its countries of operation, including Lithuania, thus providing valuable assistance to the economies of those countries in times of restricted capital availability. Although the EBRD’s activities were reduced following Lithuania’s accession to the EU, it continues to play an important role in our country. The EBRD can, for instance, encourage commercial banks to continue to provide companies, particularly SMEs, with loans. Above all, the EBRD can help to strengthen corporate governance in Lithuania’s local companies, promote investment in renewable energy, and support the development of electricity grids.</p>

This Protocol, which supplements the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, is the first binding instrument relating to small arms adopted at global level. The proposed regulation introduces an ‘export procedure’ to be applied by Member States to exports to third countries. The adoption of the regulation under the ordinary legislative procedure enables Article 10 of the UNFP to be applied in all the Member States, which finally establishes a uniform system for trade in firearms.

      <p sl="it">Since the European Union is one of the leading weapons manufacturers and exporters in the world, the creation of a uniform system for trade in firearms, their parts, components and ammunition is absolutely essential. This is not a matter of a simple regulation to reduce the maximum time allowed for processing authorisation requests, particularly with regard to arms for civilian use. Rather, it relates to the obvious need to set up a tracing mechanism using export authorisations, as well as import and transit measures, that are designed to strike a blow against illegal weapons trafficking. I would like to congratulate Mr Iacolino on this text, which aims to protect the safety of the Union and the weapons industry. I hope that all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified the United Nations Firearms Protocol will reflect upon and adopt the measures set out in the Protocol, deciding to work together to fight international organised crime and to bolster cooperation between national authorities.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report in question is particularly important because it concerns the adoption of the regulation implementing Article 10 of the United Nations Firearms Protocol which establishes a uniform system for trade in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition within the EU Member States. I would like to remind you that Europe has a long, well-established tradition in the field of sport shooting, where over 10 million citizens, in full compliance with the legal provisions in force, make a significant contribution to the economic wealth of the EU. The result we have achieved today, thanks, in particular, to the active participation of all stakeholders in the consultation process, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, entailed a long, painstaking process aimed at satisfying the provisions of the UN Protocol and making them compatible with the current situation in Europe, where 27 Member States have very different national laws in this area. I am therefore very pleased at the adoption of this new instrument which, in my opinion, marries two key requirements: helping to combat illegal trafficking in firearms by encouraging and strengthening cooperation between States, and harmonising and simplifying procedures for stakeholders in the sector, such as hunters and sport shooters.</p>

In the light of the continual growth of cross-border organised crime within the EU – particularly after the latest enlargements towards eastern countries – taking steps to meet EU citizens’ safety requirements assumes the utmost importance. The adoption of specific legislation on trafficking in firearms responds to this requirement.

      <p sl="pt">The trafficking of arms is one of the illegal activities that continue to threaten the EU’s internal security. This initiative concerns the sale and transfer of firearms, and their parts, essential components and ammunition within the Union, and is part of the EU’s policy on combating transnational crime.

Adopting shared, Europe-wide rules for more effective export control represents a huge opportunity to improve safety in Europe. On the other hand, businesses must not be burdened by excessive requirements, which would reduce their competitiveness to the benefit of foreign manufacturers. It is important to ensure that these changes can contribute to the formation of a community of European citizens that is an ever more united and steadfast presence on the international scene. This can only be achieved, as stressed in the report, if the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of weapons is prevented.

      <p sl="sk">The proposal for a regulation aims to implement Article 10 of the United Nations Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition. It was adopted in May 2001 as a Protocol supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. It entered into force on 3 July 2005 after it had been ratified by 40 countries and is the first binding instrument relating to small arms adopted at a global level. The proposed regulation introduces an export procedure to be applied by Member States to exports to third countries. Its adoption would enable Article 10 of the United Nations Firearms Protocol (UNFP) to be applied in all the Member States, which would establish a uniform system for trade in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition within the European Union. The aim of harmonising and simplifying the procedures followed is supplemented by the endeavour to help combat illegal trafficking in firearms by encouraging and strengthening cooperation between states. The proposed regulation covers the trade in and transfer of non-automatic firearms and their parts and ammunition for civil (non-military) use to third countries, including countries which are not contracting parties to the UNFP. I firmly believe that it is important for Article 10 of the UNFP to be implemented in all the Member States with a view to harmonising procedures in the attempt to create a common system to regulate the trade in firearms.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Iacolino, which must be praised for dealing with such a delicate and controversial issue as the implementation of Article 10 of the United Nations Firearms Protocol and the establishment of export authorisation, import and transit measures for firearms, their parts and components and ammunition. Article 10 of the Protocol must, however, be adopted by all the Member States in order to provide a genuine, unanimous response to illegal trafficking in weapons, which is clearly one of the main causes of disagreement in this resolution. On the other hand, as we pursue the entirely positive aim of fighting crime, we must not run the risk of hindering or making legal trade in weapons difficult. Mr Iacolino’s text succeeds in acknowledging the needs of an economic sector that is important not just for individual Member States, but also for the European Union. I think that managing to balance both sides of a thorny issue is a notable achievement in the approach to implementing Article 10 of the Protocol.</p>

      <p sl="it">We believe that export authorisation should be granted only after import authorisation has been obtained from the third country and a notice of no-objection to transit has been issued by the country of transit. The regulation introduces a novel procedure – based on the principle of tacit consent – to be used in the event of the transit country failing to register objections within a specified period. We consider it essential to introduce certain simplified procedures for some types of export and some categories of users. Member States will have to undertake to give the competent authorities appropriate powers and lay down rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this regulation. Lastly, we would stress how important it is for Article 10 of the UNFP to be implemented in all the Member States with a view to harmonising procedures and finally creating a common system to regulate the trade in firearms.</p>

The procedures required of hunters and target shooters when they temporarily leave the territory of the European Union have been simplified. Similarly, administrative procedures for dealers and manufacturers of small arms have not been increased. Weapons collectors will not be affected by this regulation. In the EU, there are hundreds of SMEs which represent not only jobs, but also expertise in the manufacture of our sporting weapons. We have been careful not to penalise them, in particular, in the face of foreign competition. We must stand firm against terrorism and all forms of crime, and prevent the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, but this should not be done at the expense of the noble passion of millions of our citizens.</p>

I therefore welcome the draft regulation submitted by the Commission in May 2010, which is directed towards the implementation of Article 10 of the UN Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition.

The proposed regulation will fill the gap giving the EU exclusive competence in the area of the common commercial policy, harmonising and simplifying the procedures in all EU Member States for trade in arms with third countries. As 10 years have passed since the adoption of the United Nations Firearms Protocol (UNFP) at the United Nations General Assembly, the application of its provisions in the Member States is very uneven (the Protocol has been ratified by 13 EU Member States and signed by nine, while five have not adopted it, among them, major arms exporters), and this transposition of Article 10 UNFP into EU law will help establish a uniform EU system for trade with third countries in small firearms. The aim of the regulation is not to place an additional financial burden on companies (it provides for appropriate simplification of procedures), but to promote cross-border cooperation and strengthen the fight against illicit trafficking in firearms. I also welcome the rapporteur’s initiative of including a reference to Article 2(2) of the Council Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States.</p>

Above all, a uniform trade system will facilitate the activities of traders because it will simplify the procedures applied, and Member States will also be able to apply the export procedure to exports to third countries. I believe that it is appropriate to reduce the maximum time allowed for processing export authorisation requests in order to speed up administrative and bureaucratic procedures and enable exporters to plan their activities more effectively.

The fact that the Protocol has so far been ratified by 83 countries, including many Member States of the EU, leads to the conclusion that supporting this kind of initiative is the right path to take.

The termination of the trade preferences in December 2010 deprived the beneficiaries of an objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU. Not only could the economic recovery of the Western Balkans be seriously jeopardised, defeating all the efforts made so far, but it could also have negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report. In a sense, the measures contained in the report could appear controversial, since they aim to bring in a preferential regime for goods originating from Balkan countries. Considering our opposition to these countries’ rapprochement with and entrance to the European Union, setting up a preferential regime for goods from the Balkans could appear problematic. However, this document does take account of the possible damage that this kind of change could have for the EU market. It therefore proposes the adoption of defensive countermeasures to prevent our market being damaged in any way, up to and including the partial suspension of the preferential regime if any real problems arise. Since the document takes account of our market’s needs and makes them a priority, I have decided to vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of amending Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009. It is absolutely essential, at this time of crisis, to support the economies of developing countries. Granting Western Balkan countries privileged, temporary access to the EU market can mitigate the effects of the economic crisis on this region and therefore assist and accelerate the processes of political stabilisation. Indeed, by amending Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, trade preferences will be extended until 2015 for almost all products from countries and territories benefiting from the concession. I feel compelled to point out that the Balkans is a region of priority significance in our foreign policy. Its geographical proximity, intertwined security interests, migratory flows and trade are all factors that contribute to the significance of south-eastern Europe. We must be aware that these countries could, in future, have a huge influence over the political and economic stability of the EU. It is therefore imperative to facilitate the economic development of the Balkan regions through this proposal, which will allow trade preferences for these regions to be extended and therefore bring political stability to the entire region.</p>

Since 2000, the EU has granted exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in these countries as a way of supporting internal reform processes and the implementation of democratic regimes. I voted for this report, as I believe that the extension until 31 December 2015 of trade preferences is crucial for the Western Balkan countries linked to the Stabilisation and Association process: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Under these preferences, these countries benefit from significant economic advantages in their exports to the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report approves the proposal for a regulation whose purpose is to extend until the end of 2015 a series of trade preferences awarded to the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo. These preferences, initially set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, and subsequently codified in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November, expired at the end of 2010.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur argues that the end of the trade preferences ‘could have negative consequences for the overall economic performance of the Western Balkans, with consequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes. As the report acknowledges, the aforementioned processes fall under the umbrella of the enlargement strategy of the EU, which is therefore seeking to ‘take charge’ of them in defence of the interests that govern the integration process itself; the same interests that benefit from it. The regulation provides for measures that the Commission could adopt ‘should imports of agriculture and fishery products cause serious disturbance to the EU markets and their regulatory mechanism’. These measures are used at the Commission’s discretion, and they do not adequately protect the Member States that feel they have been treated unfairly. The products involved – some of which could be considered sensitive – include fish, meat and wine.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introduced exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process, whereby unlimited duty-free access to the EU market is provided for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process. Stabilisation and association agreements and interim agreements establish a contractual trade regime between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina and between the EU and Serbia. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 by withdrawing Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia from the list of beneficiaries of tariff concessions granted for the same products also in the context of the contractual regime and to adapt the global tariff quota volumes for specific products for which tariff quotas were granted under the contractual regimes. At the same time, Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 remains the main instrument governing trade relations with Kosovo. Uninterrupted access to the EU market is a crucial factor for reviving the economy of Kosovo and the entire region, whilst avoiding any negative effects on the European Union. For these reasons, I believe it is appropriate to extend the validity of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 to 31 December 2015.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The EU has given the Balkan countries a clear prospect of EU membership and is encouraging internal reforms in these countries in many ways through stabilisation and association agreements and, as the largest donor in the region, is gradually helping to establish a free trade area between the EU and the Balkan countries. Autonomous trade preferences have been in force since 2000, and in 2007, these were renewed and unlimited duty-free access to the EU market was granted until the beginning of 2011 for nearly all products originating in these countries. The EU is therefore currently the Balkan countries’ largest trading partner. Trade is one of the main instruments for promoting development. By suddenly terminating the trade preferences, particularly now against the backdrop of the economic crisis, the EU would not only deal a painful blow to the economies of the countries in the Balkan region, but also to the political stability of the region. On the other hand, the Commission is given sufficient leverage to take restrictive measures if faced with serious market distortion in the agricultural and fishery sectors.

Indeed, there are absolutely no downsides to extending a trade system to which the EU has provided far-reaching access, thereby allowing many third countries to bypass most duties and customs issues, providing fresh impetus to the relevant economic sectors at a time of international economic strife. Measures like these, thanks to increasing relations with third countries, can only serve to catapult the markets back into action.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report supports the extension of the Western Balkan countries’ trade preferences until the end of 2015. The aim of extending this measure, which dates from 2000, is to maintain EU support for the revitalisation of the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to EU markets. The expiry of the trade preferences would rob their beneficiaries of an objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU. This could have extremely negative consequences for the overall economic performance of the Western Balkans, with consequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes. Moreover, their economic recovery could be seriously jeopardised. I voted for the report for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Western Balkan countries benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association Process have privileged access to the EU market on account of trade preferences introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, which have since been amended several times and codified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009. Pursuant to this regulation, such trade preferences should only be granted until 31 December 2010. However, in view of the current financial situation, not renewing them could have dire consequences for the economies of these countries. As such, I believe that this amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 is fully justified, as, besides introducing certain adjustments that have become necessary following the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, it extends these preferences until 31 December 2015.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. These ‘exceptional trade measures’ with the partners in the Western Balkans under the EU Stabilisation and Association programme are indeed preferential tariff measures, which guarantee duty-free access for most of the partner countries’ exports into the EU market. They need to be notified to the WTO. The trade preferences were originally granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 and currently apply to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo (Albania, the Republic of Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Montenegro fall under a different scheme). The present dossier extends the validity of these measures by five years, until 31 December 2015, and makes certain adjustments due to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia.</p>

Though worthy in its basic principles, this measure cannot guarantee with any certainty that the authorities in the relevant countries will carry out the requisite checks on the goods to combat counterfeiting and therefore protect our businesses, which often suffer at the hands of unfair competition.

      <p sl="pt">Exceptional, unlimited, duty-free access to the European Union market was granted by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process, with the purpose of revitalising their economies; following a number of amendments, it was codified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009. These trade preferences are currently applied to Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Serbia and to Kosovo, and products originating in Albania, in the Republic of Croatia, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Montenegro continue to benefit, under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, from measures more favourable than the trade concessions provided for in the framework of bilateral agreements.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Insofar as the interim agreements and the stabilisation and association agreements provide for trade concessions to Bosnia and Herzegovina on the products identified in the autonomous trade preferences, these concessions should be withdrawn from the regulation. However, the termination of the trade preferences would take from the beneficiaries an objective economic advantage in their trade with the EU.

Given that the economic preferences introduced by this regulation support the process of transition and reform in this region and that Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 expired on 31 December 2010, I think that, during the current crisis, extending its validity until 31 December 2015 is a suitable step for supporting economic development and stability in the Western Balkans. This means that products from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro or Serbia will continue to benefit from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in the cases specifically mentioned.

The road map for stability and growth is a convincing plan both for the markets and for the European public, and it has the support of the overwhelming majority in Parliament. It introduces concrete measures to enhance the benefits of the single market: strengthening the digital internal market and the internal energy market, new legislation on patents, and new free trade agreements. Lastly, it proposes a programme to support young people looking for their first job, which has been a flagship initiative of mine and of the Portuguese delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) since the start of this session.

It stresses the fundamentals of the economic and monetary union, particularly the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which has now been strengthened, and with which it will not be possible either to overcome the inequalities existing within the EU, or to prioritise the creation of jobs with rights, or the eradication of poverty, social exclusion, and society’s inequalities and injustices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As we have been arguing for a long time, what was needed was to definitively replace the SGP with an employment and social progress pact. The basis of this pact would be to develop a series of policies diametrically opposed to so-called ‘austerity’, of which the programmes of aggression against the workers and peoples of Greece, Portugal and Ireland currently being imposed by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission are extreme examples. Instead of transferring more millions from the pockets of the workers and the peoples to private banks, there is a need to promote public control of sectors like the financial sector, which is of considerable importance if it is to be rescued from the ‘casino economics’ to which it has been abandoned.</p>

This is all happening at the same time as they are preparing to give billions of euro to the banks, transferring their debts to the public sector: in other words, to the workers, young people and women who are in precarious situations or are unemployed; to the pensioners without a decent standard of living; and to the small and medium-sized enterprises that are already unable to cope with the financial throttling and the sharp decline in the people’s purchasing power.</p>

Although the European Union is facing a number of problems and challenges, this is undoubtedly the greatest.

The inability to resolve the crisis in the euro area is undermining the legitimacy of European institutions and frustrating the citizens of the Member States. Progressive, prudent and consensual decision making, which is characteristic of the EU even in normal times and is the source of its legitimacy, must find its limits in this crisis, otherwise there is a danger of collapse. We should make every effort to move politically acceptable decisions towards realistic solutions in order to address the crisis. At the June summit, the EU Heads of State confirmed their commitment to do everything necessary to maintain the financial stability of the euro area as a whole. I firmly believe that next week’s October meeting of the Council will be the last opportunity to confirm these words. After then, it could be too late, because it is only a clearly defined and convincing plan of measures, prepared and approved in the presence of democratically elected representatives of the European Parliament, that could contribute to the restoration of confidence in the euro area and the EU as such.

It is Europe’s turn to take the measures that Latvia has taken, in order to overcome the financial crisis. Europe must embrace fiscal discipline and introduce mechanisms that would not only allow us to overcome the crisis in the euro area but also achieve more rapid economic recovery. We must also prevent the possible recurrence of such a crisis. Europe’s largest economies are important export markets for Latvian businesses. A decline in growth or even recession in those economies as a result of the euro area crisis would be most unwelcome for Latvia.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the joint EPP, ALDE, S&amp;D, and Greens resolution; nevertheless I find adding the following points very valuable. We have to concentrate also on growth and jobs, after austerity measures. This means that fiscal consolidation has to be accompanied by clearly defined long-term macro-economic targets, including those identified in the Europe 2020 strategy. We have to prioritise especially our fight against unemployment, with the main focus on youth unemployment. This will cause a new crisis in the not so distant future if we do not take it seriously today. Secondly, we need to boost trade and win back trust from our strategic partner countries. In this matter, we have to seriously look into reducing non-tariff barriers and other regulatory obstacles to trade. The EU needs to define regulatory dialogues with these key countries as one of the key regulatory priorities of the new EU trade policy under the Europe 2020 strategy. The EU has to ensure coherent and coordinated implementation of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral trade rules.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The motion for a resolution to wind up the debate on the Council and Commission statements on preparation for the European Council meeting deserves our broad support. Its key merits are as follows: firstly, that it calls for communitisation of the European Financial Stability Facility, which should allow the national debt crisis to be overcome. This facility should make it possible to curb the tendency to take on more debts and prevent the negative consequences of such debt. Secondly, it proposes to develop a plan for growth through investments financed by project bonds. Thirdly, it declares the European Parliament’s willingness to play an increased role in finding a solution to the crisis within the European Union.</p>

We must be very careful not to make changes that would harm our markets and our internal competitiveness. I believe that different tax systems help to induce progress and maintain a higher level of competitiveness for the EU, vis-à-vis third countries as well.

Above all, we need to discuss in detail an EU plan for the recapitalisation of European banks which would enable us to react promptly to recapitalise lenders affected by the credit crunch in the euro area and organise new stages of financial assistance. Another clearly important topic for discussion at the Council is a European growth, investment and jobs plan that should also include project bonds. Moreover, ways of improving Member States’ efforts to coordinate and harmonise elements of their tax systems, including measures against tax fraud, evasion and avoidance, should also be discussed. Proposals to complete the overhaul of financial market regulation to make the EU economy more resilient to future crises must be considered as a matter of urgency.

Therefore, the argument runs, their accession to the Schengen area is still premature. That said, it seems that not much confidence is being placed in the abilities of these two countries to protect their borders, particularly their external borders.

On that, I am entirely in agreement to say that we need to look more carefully at difficult issues such as the fight against corruption and organised crime.

      <p sl="ro">It is, however, unfortunate that strong and traditional parties are managing to change their public agenda rooted in Community standards and requirements under pressure from extremist parties which are governing on the back of Europe’s slide towards isolationism and extremism partly due, perhaps, to an excessively liberal policy on immigration from outside the Community.

One of the reasons why we in the East lived through communism for half a century was the treachery and cowardice of the West. The lesson in humility dished out to us by some of the old Member States reminds us of this and will probably cure us of our illusion of having returned to the cradle of normality.

As regards the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, and despite the postponement following the Council’s failure to vote on 22 September, I would like to stress that the suitability of both countries to join the Schengen area was certified by Parliament and the Commission back in June. I therefore believe that the accession of these countries should occur as quickly as possible, as outlined in the resolution that has now been adopted.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Bulgaria and Romania have transposed the Schengen acquis satisfactorily and are now objectively eligible for accession to the Schengen area. Despite the efforts of both countries, some Member States have been raising objections to accession, which cannot fail to cause ill feeling within the Union. While caution and concern for the Union’s internal security are understandable, it cannot be considered appropriate to seek to change the rules for accession to the Schengen area after the countries in question have undertaken reforms and improved their services so as to comply adequately and in time.</p>
      <p sl="pt">By acting in this way, the Member States that are blocking the accession of Bulgaria and Romania are weakening solidarity, and are threatening security and the quality of the level of Europe’s requirements with regard to areas as sensitive as freedom of movement, migration and border security. It should be noted that I am not trying to suggest that we should not maintain robust criticism of the weaknesses that Member States may have, or debate organised crime and corruption: rather, I argue that we cannot set rules for accession and later seek to bar countries that meet these rules from entering the Schengen area.</p>

I therefore believe that the Member States should meet their commitments under the EU legal framework in relation to the criteria for accession to the Schengen area and, as a result, they should take the decision to enlarge the Schengen area so that it includes Bulgaria and Romania, without imposing additional criteria on the Member States that have already embarked upon the process of accession to the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The creation of the Schengen area and the integration of the Schengen acquis into the EU framework is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process, which directly concerns European citizens. Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis upon accession to the EU in 2007. Both countries have fundamentally redesigned and reorganised their integrated border management systems by investing substantially in their law enforcement authorities, including the provision of training and the latest technology, and have visibly reinforced their institutional and legal frameworks, a fact which is acknowledged in all the Schengen evaluation reports. Both countries have fully implemented the Schengen acquis which, according to their Accession Treaty and the existing EU legal framework, is the only prerequisite for their accession to the Schengen area. I firmly believe that it is important that all Member States take the decision on enlarging the Schengen area to include Bulgaria and Romania solely on the basis of the Schengen acquis and procedures. I also believe that additional criteria cannot be imposed on Member States which are already in the process of joining the Schengen area.

      <p sl="en">The creation of the Schengen area is one of the greatest achievements of the European project and a display of European integration. Free movement of labour, goods and capital across national borders is the core of our prominent economic strengths. I believe these points of reference should be remembered when deciding on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area. This joint resolution, which I voted in favour of, reaffirms the readiness of both countries to enter the Schengen area, having fulfilled the criteria set out in the accession treaties for concluding the Schengen evaluation process. Consequently, this resolution strongly urges the Council to base their decision to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen area exclusively on the existing technical benchmarks established by the EU legal treaties. With this resolution, Parliament demonstrates its solidarity with Bulgaria and Romania and acknowledges their importance by asking for equal treatment and supporting their successful accession into Schengen.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The problem is not which criteria need to be met to be part of the Schengen area, or whether we need to add others on a case-by-case basis; the problem is Schengen itself. The Schengen Agreement has considerably weakened the European Union’s external borders, creating an influx of potential illegal immigrants at the borders’ weakest links. One of the countries concerned today has a common border with Turkey, which is both a country of origin and a country of transit for this illegal immigration. Greece, although ‘helped’ by Frontex, is having tremendous difficulty in controlling its own border with this neighbour, to the point where it is envisaging building a wall. Controlling borders, including internal borders, and the flows that go through them, whether goods, capital or people, is becoming more crucial everyday for our countries. Controlling a border does not mean making it impenetrable. Everyone should understand that. Aware of the harmful effects Schengen is having on my country and wishing it would withdraw from Schengen, I consequently refuse to make others suffer the same fate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this resolution to reiterate once again my support for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area. This accession, which requires unanimous approval by Council Members, was blocked on 22 September. In my view, it is disgraceful that this accession is still being blocked. This has led to a situation of double standards which is at odds with the reality. Indeed, Romania and Bulgaria fulfil the criteria as set out in the Schengen accession texts, which Finland and the Netherlands cannot ignore. The corruption that was highlighted to refuse accession, although it should be vigorously fought against, does not form part of the technical criteria. Changing the rules at the end of the process does not rest on any legal justification, and the refusal to let these countries access the area of free movement is a political decision. These countries, which already play a special role at the external borders of the EU, cannot be treated as if they were second-class countries. The EU must continue to honour its commitment to the fundamental acquis that is the free movement of persons.</p>

The fact that certain Member States have chosen to block this process actually threatens the credibility of the criteria the EU has established. Both Romania and Bulgaria reckoned with the conditions as they exist, so setting new conditions now that they have satisfied those existing conditions is wrong. It contradicts European values and contradicts what is provided in the Accession Treaty. I understand the concerns of some Member States, but this sort of action is not constructive, and I am sure that these states would not want similar methods to be deployed against them. Both my group and I trust that a sensible decision will ultimately be taken in order to allow Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen area.

      <p sl="fr">To refuse Romania and Bulgaria accession to the Schengen area is tantamount to admitting that, in the European Union, the Member States are not all treated on an equal footing. Yet to accept their accession is to go against the freedom and sovereignty of the Netherlands and Finland, which are currently openly opposed to it. If we recognise the rights of some, it will be done to the detriment of the rights of others. This dilemma exposes in a very clear way the absurdity of the Schengen Treaty, which entrusts the responsibility of controlling and protecting the borders of the area’s 25 Member States to Europe’s peripheral countries. Giving such responsibility can only be achieved if there is trust. The fact is, the Dutch and the Finns do not have this trust. Without Schengen, we would not be in this situation. Each country would be free and responsible for its borders without demanding from a third country a responsibility it no longer assumes. We therefore urgently need to review this Treaty so that everyone can be in charge of their own affairs. This is not a step backwards, it is simply returning to common sense.

Recent unhappy experience with the increased influx of migrants has revealed many shortcomings in the protection of external borders, and it is therefore impossible to remove the justified fears of some states regarding further potential threats related to the full opening of borders, such as higher crime rates and an overall deterioration in security and public order in their national territories. It is natural that any lawful state will try to protect its citizens and its internal security.

Every country aiming to join the Schengen area must be adequately prepared to protect the external borders of the entire EU and issue visas that will be valid throughout the Schengen area, and must also guarantee data protection and effective police cooperation. Thus, in order to strengthen the protection of the EU’s external borders and the security of all EU citizens, obligations provided for in the EU legal framework concerning the criteria for accession to the Schengen area must be applied equally to all Member States and, in this case, Bulgaria and Romania are no exception.</p>

While compliance with the Schengen parameters is the main requirement, it seems, unfortunately, that this is not enough for the Netherlands and Finland, whose actions are seriously hampering the work that these two countries have so far carried out with huge commitment.

      <p sl="pt">Romania and Bulgaria meet all the criteria for accession to the Schengen area, having fully transposed its acquis and undertaken the necessary reforms of their border management systems. In view of this, I believe I must add my voice to Parliament’s call for the Member States to vote, without any further delay, to expand the Schengen area to these countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">We support the common resolution submitted by the EPP, S&amp;D, ALDE, ourselves and GUE/NGL.

      <p sl="it">Romania and Bulgaria only joined the European Union in 2007. I therefore think it is premature to apply the Schengen Agreement, which provides for the abolition of internal border controls with these two countries. I would point out the concerns of France and Germany, which do not believe that Romania and Bulgaria are able to tackle corruption and fight organised crime. Given that criminal groups have already moved from Romania to other European countries – and to Italy above all – we cannot run such risks. Likewise, the Netherlands takes the view that Bulgaria and Romania have gaps in their legal and anti-corruption systems, while Finland also finds the proposal untenable.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I supported the resolution on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen. All Schengen evaluation reports confirm that further postponement of the decision on this matter is unjustified.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I call on the Polish Presidency to adhere to the Treaty and to take action which will result in Romania and Bulgaria’s accession to the Schengen area. Imposing additional criteria on these countries is unacceptable. These countries have successfully fulfilled the criteria which applied to all other Member States, and they should be allowed to accede to Schengen without further delay.</p>

      <p sl="it">After the vetoes from the Netherlands and Finland, and the rejection of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 22 September, Bulgaria and Romania will not be allowed to lift internal border controls. My opinion is that in so doing, Europe has proved its inconsistency – just as the EU’s reputation for reliability is hardly at an all-time high. There are, in fact, established criteria for these two countries to join Schengen; criteria that were met in April last year. Now concerns are being voiced about the ability of these countries to tackle corruption and fight organised crime, with demands for further progress in these areas. This has gone so far as to not even accept the proposed compromise, under which air and sea border controls would be lifted this year, with land borders to follow next year. I would like to express my support for Bulgaria and Romania, certain as I am that by defending their interests, we can also contribute to maintaining the integrity of the Schengen edifice and the credibility of the EU. The risk of disunity is already a problem, and is even more significant than the fear that corruption will destroy the system of free borders. This is becoming a critical issue in relations between the eastern European Member States – many of which contain the EU’s external borders – and the rest of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="da">I voted against the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area. The EU is quite clearly avoiding taking a stance on the extensive corruption and organised crime that are wreaking havoc in these two countries, which the responsible governments ought to focus on combating for the benefit, first and foremost, of the Bulgarian and Romanian people.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The creation of the Schengen area and the free movement of people within the EU are fundamental pillars of the entire process of European integration. This success, as well as the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into EU law, must not be threatened by populist or nationalist ideologies. The economic crisis affecting the euro area cannot be an excuse for changing Union policy and excluding Member States that demonstrably meet all the criteria.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Following their accession, in 2007, Bulgaria and Romania adopted the Schengen acquis and made the greatest efforts to meet the required criteria, specifically in terms of data protection, land and sea border areas, police cooperation, and visas. Following the positive results of the evaluations, which are a precondition for Member States’ accession to the Schengen area, the decision was blocked in the Council by France and Germany, alleging shortcomings as regards combating corruption and organised crime. I believe that the additional criteria requested contradict the fundamental values of the EU. We cannot apply different criteria depending on the country. In view of this, I am voting for this motion for a resolution and call on the Council to reach a decision as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">In the past few months, we have seen how economic imbalance threatens the survival of the euro in the euro area. At the same time, another fundamental EU project has come under threat – the Schengen visa-free regime. For the majority of Lithuanians, freedom of movement is an essential aspect of the European project and was one of the greatest privileges of our membership of the EU. This privilege was not granted to the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania and I regret that an agreement on the enlargement of the Schengen area has not been concluded with respect to these countries. Both countries have implemented SIS (Schengen Information System) systems and have guaranteed that they function properly. Concern about emigration is understandable, particularly with growing unemployment. However, the lack of unity and solidarity among EU governments on this issue is worrying. Once again, the credibility of the EU is at stake. The issue of opening borders should not distract our attention from the lack of opportunities in some Member States. Like the young people of Lithuania, Romanian and Bulgarian young people often think that going abroad will open up the best opportunities for them. I would like to stress that I fully and strongly support Bulgaria and Romania and the policy of a solidarity-based, united and non-discriminatory EU as regards its Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I abstained on this text because, aside from the condemnation of the Dutch and Finnish governments’ opposition to Romania and Bulgaria accessing the Schengen area, it automatically justifies the so-called acquis of said area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What are we talking about? Firstly, the refusal to allow all European citizens to move freely within the European Union. This is a disgrace and we know which majority is in power in the two northern European countries that have used their veto. Romania and Bulgaria meet all the conditions that current members of the Schengen area had to fulfil. The European Parliament is therefore right to condemn this veto.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the European Parliament’s resolution cannot let this opportunity pass by without giving out gold stars to the Schengen area. The fact is, Schengen is about all-out judicial and police cooperation to control the Union’s borders; it is fortress Europe against the pseudo-invasions that threaten the European identity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It fuels fear of the other, and xenophobia becomes commonplace in the words of many governments which are really only seeking to disguise their inability to manage the financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Schengen Agreement in the Treaty on European Union provides for the removal of border controls as the right of every Member State provided it meets the security requirements – a definitive catalogue. The evaluation by the Schengen Evaluation Working Group found that both countries meet the formal criteria and also that, on account of extensive investments and the latest equipment, they would, in some respects, be even better prepared than the long-standing Schengen countries. Concerns over excessive mobility of workers are unfounded in view of the fact that the level of this mobility has hardly changed from its 2% mark in the last 30 years. Moreover, the fear that opening up the borders will open the floodgates to organised crime has to be refuted inasmuch as the inclusion of these two countries in the Schengen area and the associated inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the common Schengen Information System would, on the contrary, provide increased security. Concerns can be countered with sensible arguments, and the somewhat poor justification for the veto in the Council gives reason to suspect that it is more likely to have internal political motives. A refusal to include Member States in the Schengen area on the basis of arbitrary criteria is unlawful and a disgraceful course of action for the European Union to take. I therefore voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution, in which the Member States are emphatically called on ‘not to give priority to national populism’ in the decision on enlarging the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="de">I did not vote in favour of the motion for a resolution on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen. In so doing, I did not in any way wish to belittle the efforts that these two Member States have made in recent years, but I would like to make it clear that we cannot carry on as before. There are currently still problems in the area of organised crime and corruption in these countries, which extend right to the borders with my region of Saxony. I understand the desire of Bulgaria and Romania to join. However, their arguments that similar problems already exist in the Schengen area are unacceptable. We must take the concerns of the people at home seriously if we want to continue to have them onboard with us in ‘project Europe’. I could envisage a two-stage solution, like that proposed by Germany. In the medium term, the airports of both countries could be included in the Schengen system, with the land and sea borders being included later. For the future, we need more robust criteria for accession to Schengen. The progress reports must also reflect the situation in an objective and transparent way, with nothing glossed over simply to realise political objectives.</p>
