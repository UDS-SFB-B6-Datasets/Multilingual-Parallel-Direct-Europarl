      <p sl="unknown">Unfortunately, we are going to begin with bad news. As you will already know, last night, there was a terrible road accident in Switzerland involving a Belgian coach carrying 52 passengers, nearly all of them children, of whom 22 lost their lives, while others are in a serious condition.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, has asked me to tell you that he will pay tribute to the victims at the beginning of the vote and there will then be a one minute’s silence.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">However, Ms Véronique De Keyser wishes to speak and, of course, we give her the floor; we are all concerned, and we send a message of sorrow and support to the victims’ families and the injured.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, you mentioned that my country was truly in a state of shock as a result of this terrible coach accident and, as we speak, the parents of those children are together in a school and still do not know whether their child is alive or dead because they have not yet been identified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not think the country has ever known an accident like this one. As you said, 22 children have been killed, along with the accompanying adults and the bus driver, and some have been injured and are in a very serious condition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As I will not have the opportunity to do so this afternoon, I would like to thank President Schulz who telephoned me at 07.15 this morning to say that he shared the sadness of the Belgian people and that he would hold a minute’s silence at midday when there will be more people in this Chamber. Thank you again for your compassion.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I can only echo what Ms De Keyser has said. It is a terrible accident that has happened.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is, I believe, the worst news that any parent could ever hear about their children.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We all, therefore, feel deep sympathy for them, and I am also pleased with the President’s announcement that we will be observing a minute’s silence this afternoon, when more people are present here – and the office of my group leader, Mr Daul, had, in fact, already made a request to that effect to Mr Schulz’s office – because this is grief that affects us all and the kind of grief where we need to show our commiseration with the deep sorrow of all those parents and family members affected by this tragedy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, before starting my speech here, I would also like to pay tribute and to extend condolences and grief from the Presidency to the victims and the families involved in that terrible accident. I believe that everyone in this Chamber feels for the victims and the families today and we will, of course, honour them later on, as has been stated. I believe that is very appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Danish Presidency of the Council, it is a great pleasure for me to participate in this debate and to review progress on enlargement and the accession negotiations. First of all, let me underline how much we appreciate Parliament’s interest in and support for the enlargement process. Your active and constructive contribution to the wider debate on enlargement is highly valued and appreciated.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to begin these three debates today by highlighting the resilience of the EU enlargement policy. This is sometimes overlooked, not least in times of great economic hardship and uncertainty. Last December, we were able to sign the accession treaty with Croatia, which is now in the process of being ratified by national parliaments. This should allow Croatia to join the Union in July 2013. Only two weeks ago, on 1 March, the European Council granted candidate status to Serbia. Both achievements show that the political momentum behind the EU’s enlargement policy is driven by the power to transform and bring about positive change. The process has brought prosperity and, even more importantly, it has proved to be a positive factor for peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to turn now to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Since December 2005, the country has been a candidate for membership of the EU. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is important in the region, being fully engaged in regional initiatives such as the Regional Cooperation Council and the South-East European Cooperation Process. It also contributes to the EU Althea mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At its meeting on 5 December 2010, the Council welcomed the further progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the area of reform, as well as the fact that it is fulfilling its commitment under the stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council broadly shares the Commission’s assessment of the country's sufficient fulfilment of the political criteria. Since the early elections of June last year, which followed a boycott of the parliament, the governing coalition has been stable. Let me briefly mention the progress which has been made on issues such as the reform of the parliament, the judiciary, public administration and respect for – and protection of – minorities, before I address the key challenges that remain.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the improvement, compared to 2008, of the handling of the parliamentary elections on 5 June 2011, which were competitive, transparent and well administrated throughout the country. Naturally, the government needs to implement fully the conclusions and recommendations of the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission, particularly regarding the separation between state and party activities during the campaign period. We expect the 2013 local elections to be handled equally well as – if not better than – the 2011 elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also welcome the fact that the government coalition has resolved earlier difficulties and has strengthened internal cooperation. It is important that the momentum of the reform process be maintained. Freedom of expression in the media remains a matter of concern. We welcome the opening of a dialogue on this issue. The closure, on grounds of tax evasion, of a major television channel and three newspapers which were critical of the government has raised concerns about the proportionality and selectivity of the procedure and has reduced the diversity of the media landscape. As for judicial reform, some positive progress has been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is also the case for the amendments to the legal framework in relation to the fight against corruption. The adoption of a new criminal procedure code is a significant step forward in the fight against crime and corruption but requires further institutional work in order to be fully implemented. Corruption remains a serious problem which needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further progress has also been made in the area of cultural rights and minorities. The tenth anniversary of the Ohrid Framework Agreement provided a good opportunity for enhanced dialogue between the communities in the country. Both the letter and the spirit of the Ohrid Framework Agreement must be respected by all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Integration of the Roma in the education system has improved, but further measures need to be taken, as the Roma continue to face very difficult living conditions and discrimination, in particular, regarding civil registration. In the area of human rights, we are concerned about cases of ill treatment by special police forces as well as discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender community. This needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, the developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are encouraging. The Council has noted that the Commission has reiterated its recommendation that accession negotiations should be opened. We stand ready to return to this during our Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me end by recalling that maintaining good neighbourly relations – which has to include a negotiated and mutually-accepted solution with the UN to the main issue – is essential. We very much hope that the ongoing high-level dialogue will yield a positive outcome as soon as possible.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-014-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Štefan Füle" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, there could hardly be a greater tragedy than when lives of young ones are taken away. Let me join you and others in an expression of deepest solidarity and grief.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am delighted to be discussing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with you one week after I attended the hearing in Parliament hosted by Mr Howitt. Today will be yet another opportunity to take stock of the developments in the country during the last year.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank especially Mr Howitt for the high-quality report we are discussing today. I am pleased that the European Parliament motion for a resolution broadly shares the Commission findings in the 2011 progress report. Once again – and the third time in a row – there is a consensus between us that accession negotiations should start. As you are aware, the Council has not acted on the recommendation but has stated its willingness to return to the issue during the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is in this context that I am travelling to Skopje later today to launch the high-level accession dialogue. Our aim is to move the country closer to the European Union and to keep the European Union agenda as the driving force of the transformation in the country. It is by no means a substitute for actual negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The dialogue will take forward the reform agenda in the country by achieving a clear agreement on the reforms to be taken in five key policy areas. Firstly, as regards the rule of law – which is a policy area of strategic importance to the European Union – we will associate the country with the new approach which is currently being followed with Montenegro.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, regarding freedom of expression, the Commission and Parliament agree on the importance of this in the enlargement process. As a result of our joint efforts on this, I am pleased that the first steps to address our concerns have been taken by the government in Skopje. A dialogue between the state and journalists has been established. One of the key points discussed was the decriminalisation of defamation. I therefore very much welcome the announcement by Prime Minister Gruevski and Deputy Prime Minister Arifi that defamation will be fully decriminalised.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, public administration reforms must go forward, which means implementing the 2011 reform strategy. Fourthly, electoral reform needs to be completed. The fifth area is the development of a functioning market economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to support the country in addressing all these challenges through targeted financial cooperation. I have taken good note of Parliament’s suggestions concerning the IPA programme and the Civil Society Facility in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission also agrees with your view of the importance of good neighbourly relations between the country and its neighbours and the need to increase mutual understanding. We are closely monitoring developments in this field and will assess them again in the 2012 progress report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, you have requested that the European Union should be ready to assist in resolving the name issue. The United Nations has a clear mandate to mediate on the name issue between the country and Greece. We are helping to create a climate conducive to compromise, and we are encouraging the countries to find one. For the European Union to become engaged in a more substantial way, there would have to be a clear demand by both parties.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said on many occasions, it is a political reality that a solution to the name issue will greatly facilitate further progress in European integration. I welcome the fact that the two sides are re-engaging and strongly encourage them to build on the progress made in 2011.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-015-000" speaker_id="2073" name="Richard Howitt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by saying how proud I have been during the past year to be appointed as rapporteur to establish a very fruitful collaboration with the shadows, to support the work of the Commissioner, whom I deeply respect, and to become even more convinced that this is a country which belongs inside the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is why I endorse the call for EU accession talks to start ‘without delay’ in paragraph 1, sentence 1 of the resolution: no qualifications. It is why I have tabled an amendment endorsing the high-level accession dialogue due to begin tomorrow, not as an alternative to talks, but as an opportunity for progress which cannot be missed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I point to the improvement in elections that I witnessed and in parliamentary cooperation, to economic progress, to judicial and public service reform. I do not see as criticism the words of those who call me friendly to the country, because friendly criticism is precisely what is needed. On war crimes, freedom of media, discrimination, police ill-treatment and on the Roma, look at the resolution and you will find such friendly but robust criticism. And the decision to abolish the crime of defamation against journalists is indeed demonstration that our demands are being heard and acted upon.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is why those who wish to delete my reference to the country’s success in the basketball championships are wrong. It shows that we can appreciate the difference between legitimate national pride at the same time as warning against illegitimate political nationalism. For those who are erecting hoops through which the country must jump, it is one very apt metaphor that they can do it.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the warnings are not just to the country, but to ourselves, not least in the incidence of ethnic conflict over the last week. As I was told in the country: for stability, like a bicycle, you need to keep moving forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">And that includes the name issue. Despite the Hague judgment, I repeat today that there is no shortcut to a negotiated solution. But to those who seek to delete paragraph 15 even though it meets the UN accord: you would be sending a signal that we do not understand the feelings of the people of the country or express our desire to back a solution which is fair and just to all. And to colleagues from neighbouring countries who have negotiated with me have seen how I sought to be flexible and inclusive: just as you rightly call on Skopje to avoid provocations, in the way that you speak today and in the way that you vote, I call on you to demonstrate the very same commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shortly, this country will take over the chair of the Regional Cooperation Council. It hosted the meeting of Ministers of European Integration from across the Balkans in the wake of this year’s Commission progress reports. It is a country which has excellent relations with both Serbia and Kosovo. Its progress points to the European future of every single one of the countries, but there has to be a European future for every one of the countries, which is why this is the debate which must be heard; these are the obligations which must be met on all sides; this is a country which cannot be left behind.</p>

    <intervention id="3-016-000" speaker_id="96651" name="Eduard Kukan" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first, I would like to congratulate Mr Howitt on this good report. We agreed to reiterate in it our call on the Council to open the accession negotiations without further delay. I fully support this call as I am convinced that, in order to trigger more developments, the country needs to work on a positive agenda and the negotiation with the EU is exactly that positive agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">The more we prolong the gap between the candidate status and negotiations, the less credible the EU policy could become in the Balkans. Otherwise, I am afraid there will be some substituting agenda in some programmes as we see, for example, in the area of inter-ethnic relations in the country. Therefore, I fully support Commissioner Füle’s initiative to leave the higher level accession dialogue focused on the most difficult areas in the future negotiations. The main areas where progress is still needed are freedom of the media, reform in judicial and public administration and the fight against corruption. They need to be addressed promptly.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Macedonia has a realistic chance to move forward in the EU integration process, yet it is also our responsibility to make this happen.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Howitt for his cooperation. I think that we managed together to draft an objective report, but I cannot refrain from confessing the frustration I feel again this year because negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have not yet started. I believe that Macedonia may be a specific case of questioning our efficiency and motivation in relation to the accession process of some Member States. I believe that the dispute regarding the name – and this especially in relation to the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague – can no longer be an impediment to the European course of the country.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Beyond the criticisms that can be addressed to this Member State, as well as to others, we have to admit that there are specific situations also in states that are members of the European Union and that are facing the same kind of issues; I mean the freedom of the media, the efficiency of justice, the status of functional market economy. However, beyond these issues, I think that the European course of Macedonia should not be impeded, nor discouraged by applying palliatives, as we are currently trying to do. We have proposed in this report an arbitration in which the European Union is to become actively involved in complying with judicial decisions and in the attempt to find legally objective solutions for the European course of a country to not be impeded.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Apart from this, I think that judicial reform is essential for Macedonia and, in that respect, progress, significant progress even, was made. Of course, it must continue, but we cannot ignore the way in which the laws on the Criminal Procedure Code and the status and independence of judges have been dealt with, nor can we ignore the fact that progress was made in the context of the Ohrid Framework Agreement …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I keep thinking how wonderful it would be if we could hold a debate about the country without the name being such an issue. If we could just concentrate on the progress and on the hard work that still lies ahead, there is enough to do as regards more fundamental rights: stopping corruption and reforming the economy and the labour market. Bizarrely, reaching a solution should not be too hard. Greece has made an offer for a composite name with a geographical denomination, and Macedonia has always stated that what it finds most important is that its identity, culture, nationality and language are not questioned. We would like to give the process a small but significant push by applauding the offer, so we have put in an amendment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that other groups will vote in favour of this and – who knows? – maybe next year, we will be back here and freely speak about ‘North Macedonia’ in which Macedonian people with Macedonian identities and Macedonian culture happily speak Macedonian.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – I think that discrimination against whatever national group or other minority or even against women should be firmly combated. Some groups should be singled out by mentioning them – the LGBT community is one of them. I have no problem with a mention of Bulgarians but I would find it important to have a nuanced vision on this because there is a bit of going back and forth between Bulgaria and Macedonia in stigmatisation and stereotyping. But, if there is discrimination, it should be combated.</p>

As a member of the Delegation to the EU-former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I have been following the debate with great interest. I have been following the areas such as inter-ethnic reconciliation, fundamental rights and reforms and public administration. They all show some sign of improvement and I hope that this will continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">FYROM has also made steps towards improving its human rights. Now I understand the importance and cultural significance of the name issue and I hope that this will be resolved in due course by the parties concerned.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I must repeat once again that our position, the position of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and my personal position, is that FYROM can and must become a member of the European Union, if its people so wish. However, I cannot congratulate Richard Howitt, because I think that there are problematic areas in his motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="el">The first problematic area is the question of the name because, as long as we address this as a bilateral issue, instead of an international problem being addressed in the UN, we are not sending out the right message to the FYROM government to take the steps needed to resolve the problem. As long as this problem is not resolved, whatever anybody says, the FYROM government of the day will be unable to focus on the problems to which my colleagues referred and which need to be addressed in order to get on with the question of its accession to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">Secondly, I do not consider that accession to the European Union has anything to do with whether or not a country belongs to NATO and whether or not it is involved in NATO campaigns. Since when did we think up this new criterion, which basically turns the country into a means of serving US interests in the East?</p>
      <p sl="el">The third problem is that, while FYROM is a country with unemployment and poverty, we are basically recommending – not to say insisting on – the conservative, neoliberal policies that resulted in crisis and will exacerbate these problems.</p>
      <p sl="el">That is why I disagree with Richard Howitt’s motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Commission’s progress report maps shortcomings in crucial sectors, such as freedom of expression, justice, the public administration, corruption and numerous others, and contains stricter recommendations than last year’s progress report.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I fear that the author of the motion for a resolution has opted for a worse approach, a much less realistic approach than that taken by Mr Füle and Mr Wammen, who discreetly raised the question of the name. The author, on the other hand, has endeavoured, via the side door, to go beyond the instruction given to him to draft a motion for a resolution on FYROM and has tried, in paragraph 15, to take a stand and to formulate a name in an underhand manner.</p>
      <p sl="el">Using such word tricks is unacceptable and goes beyond the bounds of legality, because it does not promote democracy or good neighbourly relations or proper cooperation between the Member States, values which the European Parliament espouses and, more to the point, it does not make a positive contribution to the negotiations to find a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
      <p sl="el">I was also surprised by paragraph 62, in which he congratulates the country on the strong performance of its team in the European Basketball Championship. Are we serious? I think that this reference denigrates FYROM and turns the motion for a resolution into the sports page.</p>
      <p sl="el">I wish to emphasise one thing: that we politicians should not generate false hopes. FRYOM is a country that, I hope, will, in the future, meet all the criteria for accession and will, at some point, join the European Union. Today, however, it does not meet those criteria.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Mr Füle, ladies and gentlemen, it seems important to me that we can welcome the fact that there has been a report of a basketball victory, because it is a way of expressing our empathy. I have also felt pleased in the past when Greece won the European basketball championship.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe it is important for us, after a long period of making promises, to finally open negotiations with this country. It is essential that we make progress, because stability in the Western Balkans is a crucial point. Now that the process with Croatia has been successfully concluded, we should take the next step. In my opinion, we also need to offer hope for the future and show that we take the Thessaloniki agenda seriously.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, every country must also meet its obligations in full and I am slightly concerned that the ethnic conflicts, which are now obviously turning into religious conflicts, will make this more problematic. In order to achieve a successful outcome, I believe it is important that internal disputes do not break out again, that the Ohrid Framework Agreement is followed, and that the groups can be reconciled.</p>
      <p sl="de">I really think that Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should both resolve their name issues. I genuinely do not understand either side in this dispute. They should be able to come to an agreement over a question like this. The future of Europe must not be allowed to depend on this and, therefore, I think it is right for us to call on the two countries to resolve this issue, which is not of great importance, so that we can finally start to discuss the serious questions.</p>

As the Minister has already said, enlargement is one of the most successful policies. In my view, and in the view of my group, it should stay so. It should remain strong and robust.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we should capitalise on the positive dynamics facilitated by Serbia’s candidate status. It should also be a good example for the neighbouring countries that, if they work hard and implement reforms, they can go on the same path.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as FYROM is concerned, we regret that the December 2011 International Court of Justice ruling did not translate into any constructive movement towards the resolution of the name issue. I think it is tragic that the name issue can hinder the enlargement process for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We believe that it is in the interests of both the Macedonian people and the Greek people and, of course, all Europeans, that this issue is solved as soon as possible and that this country can move forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I would like to welcome the new high-level accession dialogue led by Commissioner Füle. I want to wish him every success tomorrow when he starts the accession talks.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted the status of candidate country for European Union membership in 2005, which was over six years ago now. Accession negotiations with FYROM have still not started, mainly because of the bilateral dispute over the country’s name. Supporters of opening accession negotiations with FYROM say that under no circumstances should the dispute be an obstacle in this process. We cannot accept this claim uncritically – it is important for the EU’s Member States to maintain harmonious relations. In this case, the matter concerns Greece, and we must not see Greece’s position as being weakened because of the domestic financial crisis there. On the one hand, everything should be done to ensure that starting negotiations does not mean dragging the EU into local conflicts, but, on the other hand, we need to stimulate deeper discussion on the strategy for further enlargement of the EU in the context of the grave financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the European Commission’s report is perfectly clear on the situation in this neighbouring country and, of course, recommends the opening of accession negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="el">Everyone who has commented on this issue has maintained that a supposedly bilateral difference cannot prevent a country from joining the European Union. However, the problem is not the name; it is the propaganda, the attempt to backdate the problem and the attempt to fly in the face of history and logic.</p>
      <p sl="el">Everyone who maintains that, for the sake of stability, we should forget this issue, as a result of which young people are being taught a rewritten version of the facts, is sorely mistaken. We cannot accept, and no Greek Government can accept, despite the economic problems – because I caught the hint made by my colleague – that accession negotiations can be opened with this country before the problem has been resolved.</p>
      <p sl="el">May I remind you that the Council alone is responsible for this issue and I therefore consider that, instead of encouraging this country to persist in its unbelievable propaganda, which stems from its old historic status (I refer to the communist bloc and its plans), it would be better if you told this country exactly what it must do if it wants good neighbourly relations with other countries.</p>

At the same time, we believe that it should continue reform efforts and should resolve important problems, such as corruption and human rights abuses. The thorn, of course, that remains is the failure to resolve the problem of the name.</p>
      <p sl="el">Despite the progress made over the past two years, Mr Gruevski is still playing the same games and refusing to take a constructive approach to dialogue. The forthcoming NATO summit is the reason why things are moving again.</p>
      <p sl="el">We repeat: a satisfactory solution for both sides needs to be found on the basis of what has been described so many times. This solution must be determined geographically, based on its erga omnes obligation. Every day wasted is a lost opportunity to resolve the problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">Despite its difficulties and despite the economic crisis, Greece has not stopped trying to find a solution. We welcome the high-level contacts with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, even though, as has clearly been said, they are not, under any circumstances, a substitute for accession negotiations. The key, if this country is to move towards the European institutions, is simply that it must resolve the issue of the name.</p>

Unfortunately, the ruling administration in Macedonia clearly does not seem to be working towards this and is failing to take the European Parliament’s recommendations seriously so far.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The continuing dissemination of mono-ethnic historical myths and legends, the promotion of pseudo-scientific research and the funding of propaganda films like ‘The Third Half’ ultimately heighten the conflict both within the country and with its neighbours. Recent events – the rise in inter-ethnic tension – are extremely worrying.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Anyone who thinks that the dispute with Greece is the only problem that this country has is simply being politically blind and needs to open their eyes. This dispute is merely the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, it is still an issue in Macedonia for you to declare openly your Bulgarian ethnic identity or origin. I hope that Macedonia will break any ties with the ethnically-based ideological inheritance of ‘Yugo-communism’ and work at building bridges with its neighbours. Building these bridges involves referring to common historical events and putting an end to hate talk, especially in the media and schoolbooks.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We should not bring up young people, the younger generations in the Balkans who need to live in peace and prosperity, in an atmosphere of hate. I sincerely hope and wish for such a future policy from Macedonia so that its citizens have a future in Europe.</p>

There is no agreement – it has been very clear – on what the country that we are discussing should actually be called. I am going to call it ‘Macedonia’. Of course it could always be called ‘FYROM/Macedonia’, but if we try to look at the issue in the round, we can see the absurdity of it all. I cannot think of a single precedent for when a country has come under pressure regarding what it calls itself, in sum because one of its neighbours decided one day to object to the name ‘Macedonia’. Note that the name never bothered this neighbour while Macedonia was a part of Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would be weird enough in itself, but to use the name issue to deny Macedonia the right to open negotiations for EU membership can properly be called inexcusable. For one, I certainly do not see the name question as one of the Copenhagen criteria. Worse, the dispute brings the entire enlargement process into disrepute. It really is time to find a solution.</p>

Special attention needs to be paid to this when assessing the integration efforts of the Western Balkan countries, since we are all familiar with the ethnic relations in the region and events of the none too distant past. The European integration of the region should only occur follow reassuring resolution of inter-ethnic relations in a lasting way to the satisfaction of all the national communities. I say this with regret since, for the people of the region, it would be welcome for accession to occur at the earliest possible juncture, and it is true that the means to resolve the matters at issue would also be available after accession.

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner Füle, honourable Members, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Howitt on the extensive and sterling work that he has done on this issue. I would also like to definitively state that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has taken a number of positive steps forward over recent years. The country has demonstrated political will and produced tangible results which have helped to ensure sound democratic and economic development, particularly since the elections last year. I am convinced that these efforts will continue throughout the remainder of 2012.</p>
      <p sl="da">Progress has been made in a number of different areas, for example, the reform of parliament, which took place at the same time as progress was evident in connection with the parliamentary elections held on 5 June 2011. I am pleased that a dialogue has now been initiated concerning the outstanding issues relating to freedom of expression in the media. In a democratic society, it is crucial that there is diversity in the media landscape. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has also made progress in respect of judicial reforms. It is good that steps have been taken to increase the judicial system’s independence and improve its efficiency. There is no doubt that a well-functioning and independent judicial authority will be crucial for meeting the EU’s criteria. However, it is worth mentioning that the independence of the judicial system and professional access to it, for example, are still in need of improvement.</p>
      <p sl="da">With regard to the fight against corruption, there have been adjustments to the legal framework. However, corruption continues to be a serious problem for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The public administration framework has been improved, but challenges still remain in relation to ensuring that recruitment is based on merit to a much greater degree than it has been up to now. The country has also made progress in the area of cultural rights and the rights of minorities, and the 10th anniversary of the Ohrid Framework Agreement thus provided a good opportunity for increased dialogue between the various population groups in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
      <p sl="da">The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was granted candidate status in 2005 and the country has unremittingly carried out reforms with a view to making further progress. The EU has held out the prospect of EU membership for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and that is an obligation that the EU must fulfil. I understand those Members who, in the debate today, have expressed their disappointment at the fact that we have still not succeeded in taking the decision to initiate accession negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. At the same time, it is also clear that it is the responsibility of a country which, in the long term, wishes to attain membership of the EU to maintain a constructive dialogue with its neighbouring countries. The name issue is a bilateral one, which ought to be resolved in a way that is acceptable to both parties. That is important in terms of it being possible to achieve agreement concerning the initiation of accession negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I sincerely hope that we will see progress in this area in the near future, and I would like to wish Commissioner Füle luck with the forthcoming talks. The future of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is in Europe. Let us take the right steps to ensure that this happens as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I am pleased that the draft resolution deals emphatically with questions such as the peaceful cohabitation of the Macedonian nations and the situation of the national minorities. A separate part of the text addresses the significance of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, signed 10 years ago, which is based on the principle of mutual respect for national identity and laid the foundation for resolving inter-ethnic conflicts. The laws which were adopted and amended in line with the agreement are to be welcomed. However, as I have already mentioned in other speeches, all laws are only worth as much as the extent of their practical implementation. A fundamental condition of peaceful cohabitation is the suitable education of the next generation and the fostering of sensitivity and a positive relationship towards one’s neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="hu">A new generation growing up in such a spirit is key to the creation of a multicultural civil society that is independent and open. It needs to be ensured that all children can study from appropriate textbooks in their own native language.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, it is equally important, if not more so, that children become familiar not only with their own language and culture, but also with the languages, cultures and histories of their traditional fellow peoples from a young age. Such projects fostering mutual understanding, as well as existing civil organisations, need to be supported emphatically using the Instruments for Pre-Accession Assistance. One way of promoting understanding between neighbouring nations and the development of good neighbourly relations could be to establish a history committee composed of experts from the cohabiting peoples. These measures can prevent discrimination based on nationality and foster mutual acceptance and the assumption of ethnic identity.</p>

The draft of the text clearly shows that he has successfully mastered the art of jumping onto a moving train. We nevertheless still have not resolved the greatest problem – the dispute over the name. The bid made by Catherine Ashton and Commissioner Füle – in line with our recommendation last year – to facilitate an agreement over the name has not yet resulted in the necessary progress, despite all efforts. We should therefore perhaps consider changing the mediation approach. The EU should submit a proposal to the UN for an EU representative to become mediator, or for the matter to be transferred from the competence of the UN to the competence of the EU. This proposal is motivated, above all, by the fact that negotiations have remained stuck on the same point for years, with no prospect of any change. I therefore consider it right to take steps that might lead to an unblocking of the situation. It is impossible, of course, to guarantee that such a change will bring any positive movement. The current path, however, is clearly going nowhere. The EU might at least seize the initiative in this way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner Füle, let us now turn to Iceland and underline a number of points which are also duly reflected in your resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 5 December last year, the Council welcomed the Commission’s progress report on Iceland and took good note of its findings and recommendations. Iceland has indeed made good progress over the last year and has continued to do so in the first months of 2012. The process of screening the acquis is almost complete, and there is good momentum in the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, I had the opportunity to go to Iceland, where I met with leaders in Icelandic politics, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister and other leaders. I made it very clear that we want to continue this process in a very constructive dialogue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Due to its membership of the European Economic Area and Schengen, Iceland has come to the negotiations with another starting point. In a large number of policy fields, Iceland already lives up to – or is very close to – the acquis . In this regard, it is worth noticing that we managed to simultaneously open and close the very symbolic Chapter 23 on judicial matters.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to add that Iceland benefits from a very professional administration and a very committed and professional negotiating team, also at political level. This impression was strongly confirmed when I met with the Icelandic leadership a short while ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council is committed to moving the negotiation process forward. As the Presidency, we take this mandate very seriously and will push those negotiations forward as much as possible within the merit-based approach. It is clear to all that there can be no shortcuts to membership for any countries and that Iceland will, of course, have to satisfy the same criteria in the enlargement negotiations as the other candidate countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">In December last year, the Council noted with satisfaction Iceland’s progress in stabilising its economy. The recovery from the economic and financial collapse in 2008 and 2009 is well under way. This is not least due to responsible macro-economic policies and tough decisions on structural and welfare reforms. Also due to this, Iceland successfully completed its IMF programme in August 2011 and has just recently seen itself upgraded by the rating agency Fitch.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iceland still faces challenges. But with the current economic outlook, we are convinced that Iceland will be able to cope with competitive pressures and market forces within the Union over the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me move on to the state of the actual negotiations. We have now almost completed the screening process, which is a process that examines Iceland’s level of alignment with the acquis . The Council has already received and dealt with all screening reports except those from the fishery chapters. We expect to receive that report around Easter. As for the negotiations of the 35 negotiation chapters, 11 chapters have now been opened and eight have been provisionally closed, thanks to the efforts of previous presidencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a remarkable result, which underlines Iceland’s very high level of preparedness for membership. It also represents momentum to be upheld, which we will do everything possible to achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next accession conference with Iceland at deputy level is planned for 30 March. This should allow us to take stock of progress and send clear signals as to Iceland’s and the EU’s shared commitment to uphold momentum. We hope to open at least three new chapters concerning competition policy, energy, and foreign security and defence policy, and also to provisionally close some of those chapters.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accession conference at ministerial level planned for June will confirm the results of the accession conference in March and sustain the momentum in the negotiations by opening and provisionally closing a further number of chapters.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all, we expect negotiations to continue at very good speed this semester. Some more challenging negotiations, such as those on fisheries, lie ahead of us. However, given the commitment and focus from the Icelandic side, we are very confident that, with the right amount of goodwill and political determination, substantial progress can be achieved in these areas as well. I am convinced of the commitment of all parties to bring the negotiations forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, the aim of the Presidency is to sustain momentum in the negotiations and bring them forward as much as possible. This is a task that we can only achieve with the support and cooperation of the Member States, the Commission and, not least, this Parliament, as this debate will show.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also, on behalf of the Danish Presidency and the Member States, thank this Parliament and, in particular, your rapporteur, Mr Preda, for the work done on this issue. Your continued commitment to enlargement is vital to its success – as is, of course, your particular role in promoting popular support in the EU for this cause.</p>
      <p sl="en">The resolution on Iceland and its endorsement in plenary is indeed a forceful political and strategic message. I also believe that, through contacts with fellow parliamentarians from the Althingi in Iceland, this House will be able to make an important and much-needed contribution to enhancing understanding of the EU, the values that we share and the way we work.</p>

    <intervention id="3-059-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Štefan Füle" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to contribute today to your debate on Iceland’s accession and to hear your views on this ambitious project.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to seize this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Preda, on his comprehensive report, which – in my view – is right to the point and well balanced. Since the official opening of the negotiations with Iceland in July 2010, 11 chapters have been opened, out of which eight have now been provisionally closed. This well reflects Iceland’s own merits, its advanced stage of integration with the European Union as a member of the European Economic Area, and the proper functioning of the established enlargement methodology.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also point out that the most recent internal market scoreboard of the European Free Trade Area members of the European Economic Area shows that Iceland is transposing the relevant acquis much better than the average Member State. With 0.5%, it is well below the 1% transposition deficit target set by the European Council of March 2007. Just to add for comparison: the average European Union Member State transposition deficit is 1.2%.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, together with the Icelandic authorities and the Danish and Cypriot Presidencies, is working to build on this momentum to open as many chapters of the acquis as possible in 2012. All the screening reports have now been presented to the Council with the exception of the one on fisheries which is close to completion. We hope to open up to four chapters at the next accession conference on 30 March.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be clear: 2012 will be a decisive year as we are getting ready to start, as soon as possible, negotiations on some of the core chapters, such as on fisheries, agriculture, food safety and environment. In doing so, we will always privilege quality over speed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now briefly turn to issues of particular interest that were raised by Cristian Preda in his report. Iceland was among the first countries to undergo the detrimental effects of the financial crisis and has imposed a number of austerity measures. Thanks to its effort, the economic recovery has continued over the last months with an estimated growth of over 3% for 2012. Iceland should be commended for these efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me briefly mention the pre-accession financial support measures that we are providing to Iceland. A total indicative envelope of some EUR 30 million is foreseen for the years 2011-2013, to support strengthening the country’s administrative capacity. The TAIEX instrument is fully operational in a wide range of acquis -related fields.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also providing the pre-accession support for information activities. There is a need for a well-informed and balanced debate about the accession process within the European Union and in Iceland. I therefore very much welcome the opening early this year of the European Union Information Centre in Reykjavik. The Centre will play an important role in enabling the Icelandic population to make an informed decision on their European future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most opinion polls indicate that the majority of Icelanders are in favour of continuing the accession talks and are willing to exercise their right of decision on a final deal. In spite of the diverging views on European Union accession that exist in Iceland, the progress achieved since our last meeting strongly illustrates Iceland’s commitment to its European Union aspiration and its determination to overcome the challenges ahead.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-060-000" speaker_id="96838" name="Cristian Dan Preda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, here we are in the second year when we have a progress report on Iceland’s accession to the EU and, frankly, progress is visible. Even though, this time last year, no negotiation chapter had yet been opened or closed, now we can speak, as Mr Wammen and Commissioner Füle said, about eleven negotiating chapters that have been opened, of which eight have been provisionally closed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In the past year, we have also been able to witness the intensification of debate in Iceland regarding the accession to the EU, rendered, among other things, by the reactions caused precisely by point 6 of the resolution we are going to vote on in a few hours. As I pointed out in my dialogue with the Icelandic media, it is natural for the European Parliament to take note of the restructuring of the Icelandic Government and express its confidence that the new government team will continue negotiations with a stronger and more sustained commitment to the accession process.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Recent discussions aroused by the proposal that Iceland should adopt the Canadian Dollar or the Japanese Yen as own currency show, in fact, that the Icelandic public needs an informed debate about the pros and cons of joining the European Union. I appreciated, in this context, the intervention of Iceland’s Prime Minister, stating that, in fact, the choice lies between being a Member State with full rights of the European Union and the euro area and, respectively, giving up sovereignty by unilateral adoption of a foreign currency.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I therefore conclude by stressing the importance of the debate, as both Icelandic and European citizens need to know each other and be willing to be part of a community.</p>

    <intervention id="3-061-000" speaker_id="4265" name="Göran Färm" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Preda, for his excellent cooperation. It feels good to be able to send a clear signal to Iceland that we are looking forward to having the country in the EU family. It would be good to have a new Member State with such a strong democratic tradition and a market economy that, in fact, is now operating well.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Membership of the European Economic Area and Schengen means that Iceland is already involved in close cooperation with the EU and has made a great deal of progress in its preparations for accession. It is therefore gratifying that the people of Iceland and its parliament want to complete the membership negotiations. I hope that we can now also have a constructive and serious debate on Iceland with regard to what EU membership entails.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Since I am a member of the Committee on Budgets and led a committee delegation to Iceland last year, I should also point out that Iceland’s accession will not place any burden on the EU budget. In several areas, I believe that the EU could even learn a few important things from Iceland. I am thinking of Iceland’s approach to getting out of the economic crisis. The country has successfully implemented the International Monetary Fund’s recovery programme without the one-dimensional austerity measures that have, sadly, been forced on Greece, and it has successfully introduced strict measures for controlling the financial sector.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I am thinking of the fact that Iceland’s membership could give the EU a more active role in the Arctic and thus help to bring about sustainable solutions in this sensitive region. I am also thinking of EU fisheries policy, in respect of which we could learn a great deal from Iceland’s more sustainable fisheries model ahead of the EU’s forthcoming reform, and of energy policy, which is an area where Iceland, which obtains almost all of its energy from renewable sources, could make a valuable contribution as a result of its world-leading expertise on geothermal energy in particular.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, we still need to have a sensitive discussion with Iceland with regard to the abolition of whaling and the sale of whale products, and there are a few fisheries and agricultural issues still to be resolved. I look forward to welcoming Iceland as a member of the EU, but I am, of course, well aware that the outcome of the forthcoming referendum on EU membership is by no means a foregone conclusion. In order for this outcome to be a ‘yes’ vote, we need, above all, a smart agreement on fisheries policy.</p>

    <intervention id="3-062-000" speaker_id="96937" name="Johannes Cornelis van Baalen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, as all other speakers have said, Iceland is a modern country with a very democratic tradition. It can be an asset to the European Union. If we look today, indeed, the people of Iceland and its government have pulled themselves out of the economic crisis without looking back in anger but looking forward, as the people in Ireland have also done, and this is a big achievement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course there are matters still to be considered. One important thing in this case is that in Iceland, the grip of the state on the economy is too great, so they should open their economy to foreign investments, foreign ownership, and indeed competition. This is an important point.</p>
      <p sl="de">The other thing concerns Icesave. I am from the Netherlands. Concerning the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, you can see that the obligations under Icesave have been taken seriously by the Icelandic Government and that the Icelanders are paying back money, so I am confident that they will fulfil all their obligations. Of course we need to monitor, but the prospects are good.</p>
      <p sl="de">In other words, apart from sustainable fisheries – and I think we have to have a deal on this, a commitment – we can look to future Icelandic EU membership soon and indeed, together with the authorities and the population of Iceland, we have to convince the population that the route to Europe is the best one for such an old and democratic country in such a modern environment.</p>

      <p sl="et">Mr President, since today is Mother Tongue Day in Estonia, I would like to honour it with a speech in Estonian.</p>
      <p sl="et">Firstly, we should note that Iceland may become a global leader in information and freedom of expression, primarily thanks to the IMMI – the International Modern Media Initiative – and for that reason, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an amendment that includes the IMMI in our report, and I would like to ask all those who can to vote in favour of it.</p>
      <p sl="et">Secondly, we have differences of opinion on the topic of mackerel quotas, and the report’s appeal to the parties is very precise and appropriate, but the phrase that refers to historic fishing rights should be voted out, because if we examine the history of the planet, it immediately becomes clear that the fish were here before the humans, and historic fishing rights fall into the same category as the phrase ‘former Danish Republic of Iceland’.</p>
      <p sl="et">Thirdly, Iceland has at least one big lesson for us. In this parliament, we continually speak of the need to ensure a greater female participation in management, but of the nine members of the Icelandic Government, a full five are women, which makes the country a unique example for all 27 Member States of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the ECR Group fully supports Iceland’s eventual accession to the EU. Iceland is a small, stable and wealthy democracy and a founder member of NATO and the Council of Europe. It has also made good progress in the accession process. I welcome the fact that Iceland’s Supreme Court has recognised its EEA/EFTA obligations and the jurisdiction of that court regarding compensation for Icesave depositors, which will no doubt come up during the accession negotiations. I understand around one third of the recognised priority claims have now been repaid.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given Iceland’s successful completion of the IMF’s economic recovery programme last year, and a return to positive economic growth, we have no doubt that the other outstanding claims will be repaid.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the ongoing mackerel dispute, we believe that Iceland must respect its legal obligations and we believe the EU and Iceland to be perfectly capable of engaging in constructive negotiations to resolve this thorny issue. Hopefully, we will also see the radical Commissioner Damanaki reforms of the CFP kick in shortly. Ultimately, if, after closing all the chapters, the Icelandic people in a referendum decide to join the EU, this country will be a model EU Member State and will hopefully entice Norway to join the EU as EFTA would no longer be sustainable without Iceland.</p>

    <intervention id="3-066-000" speaker_id="96646" name="Helmut Scholz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Füle, my group has been following the developments in Iceland over the last few years and the ongoing and intensive accession negotiations with great attention and sympathy. We see Iceland primarily from the perspective of a country with a very small population which has not only succeeded in bringing about social change in recent years, but has also drawn conclusions about how to resolve the causes of the crisis and taken the necessary measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">We believe that Iceland is very much on the right track. Therefore, my group is also asking itself whether Iceland can bring its experiences, for example, in the area of sustainable energy policy, into the accession process and ultimately into Europe. Some of the solutions it has put in place go far beyond the measures taken to overcome the crisis in the EU. That is what the accession negotiations are essentially about. This presupposes that the negotiations are not only transparent and constructive, but are also on an equal footing as far as their content is concerned and do not have a predetermined outcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">Some of my fellow Members would like to believe that the domestic political situation in Iceland and the accession process are not efficient in political terms. However, the key political consideration is something quite different. The population of Iceland, which, by the way, is very pro-European, because many Icelanders have studied and worked in Europe, has high expectations of the negotiations. Nevertheless, the people of Iceland do not want accession at any price. In the end, they have to weigh up the results. This is a highly democratic process which we should welcome and support.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Mr Preda for his very balanced report, but on the basis of these considerations, my group will be abstaining from voting. Why is this? Against the background of what I have said, the report contains points that we cannot support. Two examples of these are that if we accept, as my group does, that the accession process will remain open until the final evaluation of the results of the negotiations, we cannot behave now as if the decision had already been made.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the report calls in paragraph 5 for a reduction in the state’s influence on the banking sector. However, Iceland had particular challenges to overcome in this area, which we must not ignore. Instead, we must assess what has been done and make use of the findings.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, between 1958 and 1976, Iceland fought the cod wars with Britain. Now, cod stocks are rising because of Icelandic fish management.</p>
      <p sl="en">Compare that with the former UK fishing grounds, now in EU hands. Lost and ruined. The UK’s European dream turned into a nightmare. Established fishing communities die when the EU boats move in.</p>
      <p sl="en">My message to Iceland is obvious. If you join, you will lose your fish, your freedom and your currency and there is no regard for quotas or regulations in the EU. For the love of cod, do not do this. Say no.</p>

      <p sl="en">I think it is important to look at and discuss the details in the negotiations, but also to see the bigger perspective. A European Union reaching from Iceland to Cyprus will not only be a better Union but also a stronger Union. Stronger in the Nordic area, stronger in the Arctic area, but also stronger in the sense that is proving, as Iceland has demonstrated, that you can deal with economic crisis as a modern market economy and you can deal with all the future challenges.</p>
      <p sl="en">And I think it is important that we secure an agreement with Iceland that can get the full support of the Icelandic people.</p>

As leader of the European Parliament delegation to Reykjavik, I will be travelling there at the start of next month to attend a Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting. I have tabled a joint amendment with the rapporteur, Mr Preda, and with Mr Färm in a motion on today’s report. Of course, it is a cause of sadness that the coastal states have failed to come to a compromise on the division of mackerel and, at the end of the day, the future of the stock is in danger and we must do our best to bring these people back together, and, of course, the Commission is bringing in new trade measures.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, talking of enlargement encourages optimism. No Member State wishes to leave the Union; on the contrary, there are a number of states who wish to join, Iceland among them. I welcome its desire for integration and the rapid pace of adhesion negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I say adhesion because that is what it is, adhering to and accepting the European Union acquis . In the negotiations, efforts are continuing to define the adaptations that the candidate country needs to make to adopt the acquis and the timescale for this.</p>
      <p sl="es">In the Commission’s report of October 2011, we were told that as yet, there had been no changes to Icelandic legislation on fisheries, and that it is not in line with the EU acquis , nor are the current restrictions on foreign investment in fisheries consistent with the acquis : they infringe fundamental principles, like the right of establishment and the free movement of capital and services.</p>
      <p sl="es">Iceland is a major fishing nation, like my own country, Spain and my region, the Autonomous Community of Galicia. Iceland’s accession will strengthen the fisheries sector within the Union, but, Mr President, it cannot remain outside EU law in this sector.

The 2011 enlargement report on Iceland clearly demonstrates Iceland’s advanced level of preparation. The closure of eight negotiation chapters is most welcome, but the challenging negotiations are yet to come, and I mean here chapters such as fisheries and agriculture, which will need special attention given that circumstances in Iceland are different from those of other European countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greater importance should also be given to negotiations on chapters such as regional policy, the environment and economic and monetary policy. I saw that according to the recent poll, the majority of Icelanders still oppose EU membership, since 67% are against and only 33% in favour of accession, but my remark is that in the last year, support for the EU in both candidate and Member States has been very low, and therefore Iceland should continue to remain committed to the conclusion of the accession talks.</p>

They are not alone in that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Iceland has the oldest parliament in the world and we have much in common, but the government and people of Iceland must understand that their intransigence on fisheries and agriculture will require a spirit of flexibility and understanding to overcome this.

With this democratic pedigree, is it really going to give away its independence and its parliamentary democracy to the undemocratic EU, in which the unelected Commission has a monopoly of legislative initiative?</p>
      <p sl="en">The report, in its patronising way, commends Iceland for its record on human rights. What should Iceland make of such a commendation from an EU with Member States that ban political parties and lock people up for heretical opinions and that has a Commissioner who salivates at the prospect of locking up a well-known Dutch politician?</p>

We have made significant progress and have identified joint opportunities for the future, in particular, in the field of energy. Geothermal energy, which I believe is more widespread in Iceland than anywhere else in the world, has excellent export potential and will therefore bring a great deal of revenue into the country. However, Iceland is also heavily involved in tidal power plants and in osmotic power plants, in which electricity is generated from the chemical reaction that takes place when freshwater from a river meets the saltwater in the sea. Iceland is in the position to develop a completely new industry and a promising future for itself.

      <p sl="da">I would like to make it very clear that the Danish Presidency, together with the Commission, will do everything it can to take the negotiations as far forward as possible. We are also working closely with the forthcoming Cyprus Presidency in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="da">There is no doubt that Iceland has come a long way. Not only will Iceland be able to offer a great deal to the EU, the EU will also be able to offer a great deal to Iceland, and therefore we must now apply all our efforts jointly to get as many chapters opened and closed as possible. We are very well aware that there are difficult challenges ahead with regard to fisheries, but that is a task that we need to seek to fulfil together. The Danish Presidency will do everything in its power to support this process, and we also very much welcome the negotiations between the Commission and Iceland.</p>

Although I am aware that talks on some issues, such as the free movement of capital and fisheries policy, will raise a fresh set of problems, I believe that Iceland has taken a decisive step towards future EU membership.

From my point of view as an Estonian, the small country of Iceland is another good example of a courageous and forward-looking country that stands up for democratic principles. Iceland was also the first country in the world to recognise the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Estonia, for which we are thankful. Of course, the people of Iceland must reach consensus regarding accession. I wish them luck and strength for that task.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our third debate this morning concerns Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am happy to be able to give you a more positive assessment of the situation than that given in last autumn’s progress report and reflected in the Council’s conclusions of December 2011. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Doris Pack for her work on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Important developments have taken place since then, and we have reason to be cautiously optimistic. We expect the newly established Council of Ministers to deliver on a range of issues – economic as well as political – in an effort to ensure the proper functioning of the state and to enhance the European integration agenda. Let me briefly mention some of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">The most pressing need now is for agreement to be reached on a state budget for 2012 and for it to be adopted. Institutions that have a role in EU integration should be properly financed, and specific policies also need to be funded. A global fiscal framework for 2012-2014 must also be developed to ensure sound fiscal management. Crucially, EUR 100 million of macro-financial assistance from the Commission cannot be released until this framework and an agreement with the International Monetary Fund are in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its conclusions of last December, the Council urged all political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina to live up to their responsibilities and to develop a shared vision of the future of their country. It has therefore been encouraging to see the different steps taken by the political actors since then in an effort to progress towards the EU. In particular, the recent adoption of the law on State aid and the law on the population census moved Bosnia and Herzegovina in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, a very important step on the path to European integration remains. This concerns the need for Bosnia and Herzegovina to make credible efforts to bring its constitution into full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights in line with the Sejdić-Finci ruling. The Bosnian authorities must address this urgently. Improving and strengthening the efficient functioning of the state and its institutions is essential, including through the necessary constitutional changes. The European Union will need to see credible effort made in this regard for Bosnia and Herzegovina’s stabilisation and association agreement to enter into force.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I want to take the opportunity to underline that establishing an effective coordination mechanism for dealing with EU matters is crucial. Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to be in a position to adopt, implement and enforce EU laws and rules in a more efficient manner than has been the case so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">From my intervention this morning, it is clear that much remains to be done in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Certain developments have been encouraging, and that is very welcome. We will, however, continue to encourage and assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in delivering on the important political and economic reforms which are needed. I know that we can count on the support of this Parliament in this regard. We in the Danish Presidency are also very much looking forward to our continued cooperation with the Commission on these matters.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first of all thank Doris Pack for an excellent report on Bosnia and Herzegovina as the basis for discussion with all of you today.</p>
      <p sl="en">When speaking to this House about Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is difficult to be overly positive: there is light but there is also shadow. As your resolution points out, in the past year as a whole, progress has been limited. I therefore want to join you in reminding all political actors in the country of the road map towards European Union integration. In the face of last year’s political stalemate, the European Union has consistently maintained this road map and demonstrated its commitment in a variety of ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, the European Union has prolonged the mandate of the EUFOR Althea mission, with a new focus on capacity-building and training the armed forces of the country. This mission now confirms on a regular basis that there is no threat to the safe and secure environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, in light of improvements in law enforcement, we have also been able to decide on terminating the European Union Police Mission in June this year. However, follow-up will be ensured by a technical assistance mission on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, citizens continue to enjoy travelling to the Schengen area without visas, while implementation of the agreement is closely monitored. This demonstrates to the citizens that the European Union perspective is real and tangible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourthly, the European Union has enhanced its presence in Sarajevo by appointing Peter Sørensen in a double-hatted capacity as Head of Delegation, and as European Union Special Representative. The delegation has strengthened outreach and diplomatic activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">These efforts start to show results. The European Union perspective has finally begun to dominate the political agenda. A series of joint initiatives have been launched in areas ranging from the Structured Dialogue on Justice to the fiscal and budgetary framework and on infrastructure development in transport and energy. The recent developments show that this determination has been rewarded.</p>
      <p sl="en">After a year of stagnation, there is now a new positive momentum on the European Union agenda in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A State aid law and a law on the population census were adopted and a new state-level government has taken up work in February. The new Chair of the Council of Ministers, Mr Bevanda, whom I met last week, has put European Union integration at the forefront of his government programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first indications are that Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to take great strides towards becoming a member of the European Union. This, in turn, bodes well for the steps that we can undertake once the country fulfils all the necessary conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the many important points which you mention in your resolution is the necessary constitutional changes needed to be undertaken in order to enable the entry into force of the stabilisation and association agreement. The European Union needs to see a ‘credible effort’ with regard to the implementation of the Sejdić-Finci ruling to bring the constitution into compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are in close consultation with your neighbours across the river, the Council of Europe, on what this entails exactly. Decisive movement by Bosnia and Herzegovina here could unlock many new fruitful avenues for our cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Overall, 2012 will be a crucial year for the progress of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the path towards the European Union. The Commission wholeheartedly supports this endeavour and – as I understand – so does this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in six weeks, more has happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina than we had expected to occur in 15 months. I would like to congratulate everyone who has taken this route. I hope that the country’s political leaders have understood that they are losing their links to Europe and that they should not constantly become involved in ethnically motivated disputes.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report has 59 paragraphs, but, unfortunately, I can only mention a few of them. Most of them have already been covered by the two previous speakers. I would like to highlight the fact that the amendment to the constitution following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Sejdić-Finci ruling is absolutely essential. We need to see progress being made in the judicial system and, in particular, in the structured dialogue. We urgently need a national budget. It is also important that the necessary institutions are set up to enable the European Union to enter into negotiations with the country. The fight against corruption must produce some real results and an internal market must be created in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will be in the interests both of workers and of investors. The process of reorganising the education system must be speeded up and we also want to see an end to two schools under one roof. The veterinary profession and the food supply chain must be restructured to comply with EU requirements, particularly given that the neighbouring country of Croatia is joining the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to investigate whether the office of the High Representative should be closed down in the near future against the background of the recent positive developments, in order to give more responsibility to local politicians.</p>
      <p sl="de">We welcome the significant commitment shown by the EU ambassador, who has put a great deal of hard work into this country. We also suggest that he is given more resources locally to support his activities. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only country in the region which has not granted right of entry to the citizens of Kosovo. There are many Bosnians living in Kosovo who have family in Bosnia and Herzegovina and who would like to return, at least for a visit. I am expecting this issue to be resolved soon. I hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina can at least bring its stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) status to an end this year and perhaps even submit its accession application.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Ms Pack, do you think that it is a good thing for the nation states of Europe for Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the euro, because that is what is required under the Treaty if Bosnia and Herzegovina should, in fact, become a Member of the European Union, which is what you seem to be in favour of?</p>

    <intervention id="3-088-000" speaker_id="1191" name="Doris Pack" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Mr Dartmouth, I do not know why you are looking so far ahead. First, the country has to be prepared for accession and then it will join the EU. After that, it has to meet the criteria and when it shows that it can meet them, it can join the euro area too. We will welcome this, but it will not happen tomorrow or even the day after, and you know that as well as I do. You are familiar with the timeframes. Furthermore, the country’s currency is the convertible mark, which means that it is very close to the euro. You do not need to worry about it. You may not be joining the euro, but Bosnia and Herzegovina definitely will when it has achieved its goal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the new government, the State Aid Law and the Census Law. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina still needs to find a durable solution for refugees and implement Annex VII of the Dayton Peace Agreement. The main and last step necessary to comply with the conditions of the SAA (stabilisation and association agreement) is implementing the Sejdić-Finci ruling. The parliamentary committee working on this failed to come up with concrete results – that is regrettable.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you are already late for the train, small steps to catch that train will not help, especially if that train is already moving. We want Bosnia and Herzegovina to jump in, but quick and well considered reforms are needed. If Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to apply for candidate status in June, the leaders need to deliver to us and, most of all, to their own citizens. The desire of the Bosnia and Herzegovinian people to join the EU crosses all national, ethnic and religious lines and the young people need perspective, and an EU one.</p>
      <p sl="en">A better coordination mechanism and the country speaking with one voice to the EU are necessary, so is political will and leaders to talk about what binds rather than what divides the country. Divisive nationalism and extremism can divide a country, especially in a fragile region with a fresh war history such as the Western Balkans. All forms of extremism must be condemned and addressed in the region as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bosnia and Herzegovina is a country with many faces, but it is definitely not one of Wahhabites. Therefore, the only reference in the report to Wahhabites is far from reflecting the reality and this reference should disappear. For reconciliation, justice is necessary. The obstruction of justice and the denial of history and of genocide is taking the country backwards not forward. People should also be free to choose whether they want to see a movie or not. Banning the movie of Angelina Jolie is a wrong message for freedom of thought and expression, crucial in any democracy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ms Pack’s report observes that the lack of job perspectives, especially among young people, is hindering the progress of the country and contributing to social discontent. One of the reasons I was so pleased to push hard in support of Ms Fajon on visa-free travel for Bosnians 18 months ago – with which we succeeded – was to allow travel for study and business in the hope of an economic boost, as well as widened horizons.</p>
      <p sl="de">Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot prosper economically or otherwise, or find its future in the EU, without a functional state that can take decisions. Progress has been made, as Mr Wammen and Ms Pack and Commissioner Füle have said – formation of the government, adoption of State aid and census laws, for instance – but, as Mr Wammen said, without a budget, BiH cannot get EU aid. Without tackling crime and corruption and having an independent judiciary, business will not invest. Being an epicentre of trafficking in human beings is a huge shame for the country.</p>
      <p sl="de">There needs to be local ownership of reforms, but international support and guidance – especially from the EU – is still highly relevant. That is why the ALDE Group is backing the amendment from the S&amp;D Group reintroducing the explicit mention of the ‘5+2 Agenda’ as a basis for closing the OHR, and that is also why ALDE has retabled its amendment calling for the EU to sponsor a constitutional conference in cooperation with the Council of Europe across the road, which has great expertise in its Venice Commission. Thank you again to Ms Pack for a very good report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, religious extremism, like all extremism, is deplorable. A group that refuses to allow women in political posts, wants to base legislation and justice on a religious book and discriminates against other religions, and whose followers put their children in medical danger, should have no place in political institutions. I am, of course, speaking of the Netherlands here, where the party of Mr Belder does all these things out of Christian religious extremism. Aside from the luckily very limited group of voters for his party, most other Christians in the Netherlands are very, very moderate.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the same vein, almost all Muslims in BiH are very, very moderate, and, in the same vein, it would be as disproportionate to adopt a resolution here that warns of the threat of Wahhabism in BiH as it would be to adopt a resolution on Christian extremism in the Netherlands. We will, of course, adopt a text on the Netherlands tomorrow, but without mention of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is undoubtedly extremism in BiH, as there is in the rest of the Balkans. Let us warn of all extremisms that are intolerant and discriminatory. I, for one, have, up to now, been attacked by nationalist, Orthodox and Catholic extremists at the diverse Gay Prides I have been at, not yet by Wahhabis up to now. I hope you will support us in taking out the specific mention of Wahhabism in the report and let us worry about extremism in general. Otherwise, it is a brilliant report and if this is taken out, we will happily vote in favour.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group wholeheartedly welcomed the expansion package from October last year. We fully support the regulation and the recommendations of the Commission. We are fully behind the expansion and we believe that a further acceleration in the talks with Croatia and its accession in 2013 will provide a very good incentive and a model for other countries in the Western Balkans, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. This does not mean, however, that the process of further expansion will be problem-free. The statement on the lack of reform progress by Bosnia and Herzegovina in some areas is, in our opinion, an objective evaluation of the current situation in this country. In addition to better cooperation at all levels, there is a particular need to strengthen the judicial system and establish rules for the fight against corruption. Above and beyond this point, I would like to emphasise that we fully support the rapid entry of, and negotiations with, Iceland, and I have personally long stressed the strategic importance of full EU membership for Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, according to paragraph 27 of the resolution, the European Parliament is concerned about Wahhabi extremism in the Western Balkans. The statement of this fact gives me immediate reason to put a couple of questions to Commissioner Füle.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Does the Commission share this concern about the Wahhabi events in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and, if so, what is the Commission doing to combat Wahhabi extremism in BiH?</p>
      <p sl="nl">In paragraph 27, praise is given to the Grand Mufti of Bosnia for his stance against terrorism and violence. Prominent Bosnian artists and human rights defenders, such as Refik Hodžić and Feđa Štukan, on the other hand, argue that Grand Mufti Cerić is himself personally responsible for fuelling ethnic distrust and for blatant hate speech, including issuing threats against ‘the infidels’.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I am of the opinion that we should definitely refer to Wahhabism and the risk of Islamic fundamentalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the report and, in this respect, I agree with the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="de">The speeches by the rapporteur, Ms Pack, and by Mr Wammen make the disappointment about the developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina very clear. I believe we must take an objective view of the fact that the country simply does not have the will to form a single cohesive state. It also does not have the will to establish a joint Bosnian and Herzegovinian identity.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ethnic groups continue to have a sceptical or even a hostile attitude to one another. Therefore, I must advise against taking a falsely romantic view of the development of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, we should not cling desperately to the concept of a single unified state. Given the constitutional development of this country, we should also consider the possible alternatives, such as a loose federation, which may be capable of surviving, or breaking the country up into cantons, so that we at least have one contact. This country is very far from being ready to join the Union. Candidate status will not be within its reach for a long time.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, next year, the European Union will have a border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and this year is the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of war there which was instigated by Belgrade. We must be aware of the fact that it is time that genuine reforms were implemented. The EU Special Representatives, Mr Inzko and Mr Sørensen, have both done an excellent job and both deserve our support. However, as Ms Pack rightly said, the initiative must come from the country itself. This is why we need to educate a new young generation of leaders from all three nationalities, strengthen the system of local authorities and make the education system more European, including the establishment of a European university.</p>
      <p sl="de">State reform is urgently needed to transform this country into a symmetrical federation of three different peoples. All of this may be very difficult to achieve, but I do not believe that we can risk the collapse of Bosnia and Herzegovina. If this were to happen, the central Bosnian Croats, who are never referred to and who live in very isolated communities, and the Muslims would be the losers. However, even the supposed winners, Republika Srpska and Herzegovina, would also lose. It would be a disaster for everyone.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the UK is not a particularly rich country. Nevertheless, income per head in the United Kingdom is eight times that in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is a problem: how it will be met is by massive subsidies from the British taxpayer and the other EU taxpayers. In fact, the gravy train of EU subsidies has started already. In the last ten years, Bosnia and Herzegovina – not an EU member, not yet even a candidate – has received EUR 1.6 billion in assorted subsidies. There will be more to pay if it becomes a candidate and much, much more if, in fact, Bosnia and Herzegovina does become a member of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the evidence of this debate, nobody is properly counting the cost. The idea of Bosnia and Herzegovina being a member of the EU is a complete non-starter, on financial grounds alone, and I urge you all to forget it.</p>

I welcome the fact that a new government has been formed in Bosnia and Herzegovina; I believe that this represents an opportunity to accelerate the reforms mentioned by previous speakers and also to make further progress on integration with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that questions of education and employment policy, crucial for the growth and development of the country in socio-economic terms, should be at the centre of the government’s attention. Reforms in the education system should aim to make the provision of education better adapted to the demands of the labour market, and thus to increase employability, particularly among young people. This objective should also be furthered by the use of European educational programmes which support youth mobility, as well as by action to achieve mutual recognition of qualifications in the region.

I also welcome the recent appointment of Mr Bevanda as Prime Minister, which puts an end to 15 months of political crisis. However, though progress has been made, much remains to be done regarding fundamental reforms with a view to EU integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to insist here on the human and social rights issues. Though human rights and protection of minorities are broadly ensured, constitutional changes still have to be made regarding compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as the effective implementation of major human rights conventions. Moreover, though state-level anti-discrimination legislation has been put in place, its implementation remains very weak, particularly with regard to the protection of women against violence and the social protection of children.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to highlight my concerns regarding the number of divided schools and mono-ethnic schools. I know that the scars of the past take time to heal, but I believe that much progress needs to be made in terms of inter-ethnic relations.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, now that Serbia has been granted candidate status and neighbouring Croatia will join the EU next year, Bosnia and Herzegovina leaders should at last put an end to their internal conflicts along national lines. They need to reach a consensus on constitutional changes and strengthen state-level institutions so that they are capable of carrying out EU-related reforms and, eventually, accession negotiations. Bosnia and Herzegovina needs a proper government, not a council of ministers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of the outstanding issues are the property of the Bosnia and Herzegovina military and the need to follow up the ECHR ruling on the Sejdić-Finci case. The newly-elected council of ministers is doing a good job by dealing with the burning economic issues and moving away from nationalistic discourse. Unemployment and a balanced budget are the real issues that Vjekoslav Bevanda, the Chair of the Council of Ministers (not a Prime Minister), is right to deal with.</p>
      <p sl="en">Lastly, I would add that Bosnia and Herzegovina needs at least one new ministry at state level, a Ministry of Agriculture. Agriculture is one of the most important topics of the negotiations, and Bosnia needs to have adequate institutions to deal with this topic.</p>

Croatia’s accession to the European Union and the opening of accession negotiations with Serbia is certainly having a stimulating effect on the political situation in this country as well. The influence of the EU in this country should still, I think, be focused on stabilising local democracy and calming or combating ethnic tensions.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The motivation of the European perspective for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as its political leaders, can be a significant incentive for the implementation of the necessary reforms to the political system and the public administration institutions. We need be under no illusion that the road taken by Bosnia and Herzegovina towards a European political culture will be simple. We must be patient and we should be able to appreciate every positive change that occurs in this country.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, unfortunately, there is a significant difference between wishes and reality in Bosnia. It is understandable that the young people want to join the EU, despite all the obstacles, but in reality, things look very different.</p>
      <p sl="de">In economic terms, the country has hit rock bottom. The ethnic groups have a more than sceptical attitude to one another. The administration is inefficient and, most importantly for me, Islamic fundamentalism is a problem. Even if many of the ladies and gentlemen here in the Chamber do not want to believe this, it is even reaching as far as the primary schools in Austria and we really should not underestimate it.</p>
      <p sl="de">A state must fulfil its duties in order to be accepted and recognised as a state. I believe that rushing to join the EU is the wrong thing to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one more comment on Christian extremism, which has already been mentioned by one of the previous speakers. Christian extremism may not be particularly cool, but, unlike the Salafists, the Wahhabists and Sharia law, I do not believe that it represents a threat to Western culture, the European culture of the European Union.</p>

When I talk about extremism in inverted commas, I do not mean what we generally understand by violent extremism. Instead, as previous speakers have already said, I am referring to Christian extremism. When a religion calls on us to love our neighbours, and that is how I understand it, I cannot envisage it including the form of extremism which you rightly disapprove of and which I am also opposed to.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, most of us would like to see Bosnia and Herzegovina developing strong and effective institutions at state level.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obvious that without a functioning state, no country can cope with the demands of European integration. But there is a real risk here that we, the EU, can overshoot it. If we push too hard for central institutions, our efforts might backfire. It will stoke precisely those centrifugal and nationalist dynamics that we want to prevent, because in the end, for any state to function, it requires democratic legitimacy and that cannot be imposed by outsiders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear: European integration can indeed transform the politics and economics of candidate countries as it has done in my country, but it cannot construct democratic legitimacy of states and their institutions. Only its citizens and its political elites can.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, Bosnia and Herzegovina can only join the EU as a single state, but it needs to be a single state that its citizens and politicians from the three entities will agree upon amongst themselves.</p>

      <p sl="sl">The report addresses and supports the European perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina – the only legitimate approach. I would like to join those Members who believe the reference to the Wahhabis as a threat in Bosnia and Herzegovina is completely unnecessary. In fact, this is misleading and somewhat casts suspicion on what Bosnia and Herzegovina stands for, which has always been cultural, religious and ethnic diversity.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to finish by saying that it is essential that the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina is allowed, as far as possible, to decide its own fate, including the country’s constitutional arrangements. In doing so, the Dayton Agreement, which brought an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, cannot be the only taboo subject.</p>

      <p sl="en">Is Bosnia’s embracing of the free movement of people going to extend to the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or simply to the rest of the EU? Many Bosnians will regard the EU as an attractive escape route from the fragmented and still dangerous Bosnia and Herzegovina. From the point of view of the EU’s existing members, Bosnia will be yet another net recipient of EU funds and, of course, an opportunity for the rest of us to import some of their interesting and enriching ethnic friction, just in case we have not got enough of that already.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to welcome the report by Doris Pack. It is realistic and balanced, but it is difficult to accept paragraph 27 of the report because it is not – shall I say – ‘politically correct’ to label an entire community as extremist.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe for all of us, Bosnia and Herzegovina is important because we must avoid the failure of a state. The crucial issue for this state is to make the appropriate constitutional reforms to benefit the entire community, because it is multicultural and multi-ethnic. How we deal with this community depends on us, and for this reason we must back increased EU support for Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another issue that I want to tackle is the question of impunity. All of us know that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there have been a lot of war crimes in the form of rape, but impunity still exists.

Are you and your colleague really of the opinion that we should keep quiet about this extremism? Do you believe, despite the liberal Muslim tradition in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that we really should say nothing about the influence of Saudi Arabia and the Wahhabi extremists who are putting a lot of money into the country?

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, it has been a very useful debate indeed and many important aspects have been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I come back to the honourable Member Belder’s question, let me say the following: while continuing to denounce and reject all forms of extremism, the Commission is not commenting on specific religious orientation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. You will not find that in our last progress report.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many statements from religious leaders, from all sides on an almost daily basis, and we urge restraint and a spirit of cooperation and reconciliation from all responsible religious and political leaders.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also highlight some other important issues which have been voiced in your debate. As also raised in your draft resolution, it is important that the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina carry out necessary technical preparations for a population census as a matter of urgency. The Commission is ready to give technical support for this and to be actively involved in the census so essential for the socio-economic development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your resolution also highlights the urgent need for all levels of authorities to strengthen coordination in all sectors relevant for the transposition of European Union legislation and for financial cooperation. It is evident that in this area, Bosnia and Herzegovina need to undertake substantial efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The debate overall has shown that a large majority of colleagues here share our views. We are united in our joint commitment to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s European future and we are clear in what we expect from the country in the next months in order to move forward and make up for lost time.</p>
      <p sl="en">It will not be easy with the election campaign starting very soon for the local elections in October. There will be many challenges ahead and we need to make sure that the politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina are ready to take up a greater part of the ownership of the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is time for Bosnia and Herzegovina to catch up with its neighbours. What we need more than anything else for this is a positive spirit towards compromise. All of us should thus encourage politicians in the country to make compromises in the European spirit, to leave the past behind, and to move the country towards its European future.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner Füle, honourable Members, the EU has given the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina the hope of a future within the family. It is therefore gratifying that a new government has now been formed there and that the political leaders are taking joint responsibility for the country’s development.</p>
      <p sl="da">There are signs that the new government will take a series of initiatives, economic as well as political, in order to be able to bring about progress for the country’s citizens and promote integration in relation to the EU. Thus, there has already been progress in respect of two of the three conditions for the entry into force of a stabilisation and association agreement: firstly, the adoption of the law on State aid and, secondly, the adoption of the law on the population census. The question of bringing the country’s constitution into line with the European Convention on Human Rights is still to be resolved. There can be no doubt that a credible effort in this regard is crucial to the country meeting its obligations.</p>
      <p sl="da">The next milestone is the entry into force of a stabilisation and association agreement. This will systematise the dialogue between the EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina and make it possible to work in a more targeted way on the reform efforts. It is important to send out the signal that the EU will continue to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina, including via the EU Special Representative, Peter Sørensen, who has done a splendid job which has been much appreciated.</p>
      <p sl="da">The primary responsibility for pushing things forward lies, of course, with the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is up to them to show leadership and it is up to them to take the necessary decisions and continue the path of reform so that Bosnia and Herzegovina can also make progress along the path to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">The road to the EU is a long and tough one. It is, and should be, based on hard work and own merit. Croatia’s accession to the EU and Serbia’s recent candidate status demonstrate that EU orientation is available for those countries that are willing to undertake reforms and take the crucial steps. I hope this will be a source of motivation for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I wish Parliament, the Commission and the Council well in their work in carrying out the important tasks ahead of us in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="en">Along with other Western Balkan countries, Bosnia is currently facing the double challenge of integrating the EU while consolidating the constructions of its nation. Its political, economic, social and structural improvements are unquestionable; this duplicity remains one of the main differences with the 2004 enlargement and could represent an extra burden to achieving the integration. Nevertheless, I believe the EU could make this task easier for the future Member States. In fact, 20 years ago, Europe intended to defend the values of multiculturalism in the Balkan region. Nowadays, it appears that some of the EU’s main leaders have stopped believing in these values. If the principle of enlargement itself is not at stake, how can multiculturalism be promoted in the Balkan region when multiculturalism is discarded by the founding countries of the EU? It is not easy to expand when there are doubts at the core, yet it is desirable and pressing for us to set a good example and structure for these future Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the fishing industry, although diminished in size in recent years, remains of great importance to my constituents in Wales in terms of its contribution to employment and to the wider economy, which is why I welcome the report on the European Fisheries Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">This fund is one of the financial tools at the EU’s disposal that can be used to help contribute to regional development and also deliver the aims of the common fisheries policy, such as ensuring the conservation and sustainability of fish stocks and the long-term viability of the fishing sector. Given the added pressures on national financial resources as a result of the current economic difficulties, the report sensibly recommends using the European Fisheries Fund to inject funds into the economy to ensure projects can continue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fishing in Welsh waters also makes a major contribution to the tourism sector. Particularly in West Wales, therefore, which is in receipt of cohesion funds, we need to ensure that access to this European Fisheries Fund is encouraged by the more needy regions to enhance the prospects of our local fishermen, to protect our maritime parks, and to promote diversification, including boosting tourism across our coastal areas in Wales.</p>

      <p sl="da">I would have preferred the fund to have been discontinued, but as that is not possible, it is preferable for as many resources as possible to be used to speed up initiatives rather than as direct support for a particular industry.

      <p sl="it">Taking into account the fact that appropriations in this area have often been allocated to the scrapping of vessels and therefore have not contributed to the growth of fishing-related activities, I welcome the proposal to review the priorities of the EFF and to encourage easier access to European funds.

For some countries like Italy, but also Greece, the fishing industry is an important source of revenue, as well as an added value for many regions falling under the convergence objective.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I wished to support the Commission’s proposal to allow a top-up of ten percentage points to be applied to the cofinancing rates applicable to the priority axis of the programmes coming under the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), even as a temporary measure, in order to encourage public and private investment and make better use of the funds provided by the EU.</p>

Therefore, I agree with Mr Ferreira in asking for its application at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">Ms Damanaki did well to propose an urgent measure for countries with little investment capacity, as this has often been reduced to historic lows as the report shows. The debate about the reform of the common fisheries policy has already begun and therefore, EFF expenditure needs to be accelerated also by increasing the cofinancing threshold by 10%, in order to avoid there being resources from the old programming period still to be spent from the time the new reform applies. It is important to avoid overlapping between the EFF and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).</p>

We consider programmes such as the EFF to be useful tools but note that in the Member States that have suffered most in the financial crisis, the implementation of these projects is difficult due to pressures on the budget to cofinance. The report foresees a Commission proposal that would allow increased payments to be made to those countries that are suffering most from the global financial crisis, namely those that are currently benefiting from support mechanisms in order to ensure the continuation of the EFF programmes on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">We welcome the fact that, despite this, the amount that the EU contributes to these programmes will be no higher than the amount put forward in the Commission’s original decision, i.e. a budget freeze. Given that no change has been made to the overall budget, on this occasion, we voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="en">I also support the mechanisms that have been put in place that will allow provision for increased payments to be made to Member States that may have financial difficulty in implementing the programmes in question, including the Republic of Ireland, a close neighbour of my home country and constituency of Northern Ireland. We need all to do our bit to help Member States that are witnessing the side effects of financial downturn and aspire to meet the EFF aspirations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed monetary top-ups will do just this while not exceeding 10% of the maximum ceilings set in the articles of the EFF regulation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorsed the resolution on the European Fisheries Fund with complete conviction because I think the fishing industry is a very important branch of the economy in the European Union, and our approach and that of the Commission to this matter shows that the European institutions are being flexible in their response to the crisis which has struck our continent. On the one hand, we are meeting the justified expectations of interest groups and all of the fishing industry and, on the other, we are being rational in our approach to the way money is spent by the European Union. I want to stress that the fishing sector is not just a matter of economics, because it also has a health aspect. We have been talking at this parliamentary part-session about the diabetes epidemic. A healthy diet, which includes fish, is an important factor in helping us protect the health of our citizens in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, following the EU’s ban on imports of beef and beef products from the US and Canada that have been treated with growth-promoting hormones, the US and Canada were subsequently authorised by the WTO to authorise and impose trade sanctions on EU agricultural products.</p>
      <p sl="en">This had a high impact on farmers and producers across the EU. I am therefore pleased that a resolution has now been found to this trade dispute. The agreement to gradually lift sanctions placed on EU agricultural products in exchange for an autonomous tariff quota on high-quality beef which has not been treated with the hormones will benefit both sides of the Atlantic and will help, hopefully, to rebuild and strengthen trade relations in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">A free trade area means that goods and services and capital circulate without restrictions. It is the kind of deal that Switzerland enjoys with the European Union and one cannot help noticing that the Swiss seem to be doing pretty well with it. In a customs union, of course, you are dragged into a common commercial policy and a common external tariff.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been particularly disastrous to the United Kingdom, the country which did the highest percentage of its trade, without the EU, to non-European markets. We are linked into a market of similar industrialised economies, having cut ourselves off from our natural hinterland of producers. I never tire of pointing out to this House that we have confined ourselves in a cramped and declining customs union, while standing aside from the bits of the world where the growth still is, not least the wider community of English-speaking democracies. Truly our fathers made a wretched decision.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report creates a way past some of the destructive dynamics of trade sanctions and tariffs that were founded back in the 1980s and as a result of the bans on imports of beef and beef products that had been treated by hormones into the EU from the US and Canada.</p>
      <p sl="en">These tariffs have amounted to USD 116 million every year in the US. Canada and the US recently lifted their sanctions in the hope of creating an autonomous zero duty and tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef not treated with hormones.</p>

It is important to remember that in order to be effective and not damage the EU manufacturing sectors, a common commercial policy must fight for rules to be respected, as these do not apply only to a part, but to all the players.</p>
      <p sl="it">One of the fundamental rules is correct pricing, and this means tackling dumping practices effectively and energetically. When defining the extension of trade defence procedures, the Committee on International Trade was right to confirm that the time limit in anti-dumping cases must not exceed the current time limit of 15 months when defining the extension of trade defence procedures.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must not weaken the defence instruments, as the Commission was prepared to do after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force.

Naturally, I think it is very good that as part of the examination procedure, Member States which constitute a qualified majority can block a Commission proposal on commercial policy by a simple majority.

      <p sl="pl">An important tool here will be introduction of the advisory and examination procedures provided for in the Treaty.

Widespread poverty, conflicts and poor harvests in recent years have aggravated the situation. Last year, tensions in Côte d’Ivoire led to 200 000 tonnes being blocked in production and increased prices by up to 9% per day on the Euronext Paris stock exchange.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Now, the EU is dependent on cocoa imports from countries such as Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire, but trade relations should not be an obstacle to cooperation with Interpol in this area, particularly regarding trafficking of minors.

I think that these are important moments in the history and the work of our Parliament, moments when, in spite of the differences which do very clearly exist between us, we are able, for the sake of the values which have brought us together here, to rise above those divisions and vote the same way – as is the case with this problem, a problem which, as we say in Poland, is ‘crying to heaven for vengeance’. A situation in which millions of children, tens of millions of children across the world, are abused, forced to work, deprived of their childhood and deprived of their own future, is a situation which must not be tolerated. It is to be greatly welcomed that the European Parliament is taking up this question and that we are trying to get to the heart of the matter. We want to investigate the channels by which these products are moved and by which they reach the European market. We in Europe are a major buyer of many products, and this includes cocoa, and we have the resources to find out if products which reach the European market and which are paid for by European consumers are illegal products – illegal in the eyes of international law – since the producers utilise child labour.</p>

The International Cocoa Agreement 2010 replaces the 2001 agreement, to which the EU is a party. It is a step in the right direction and, among other things, it appeals specifically for transparency in the production of cocoa, because – as we were saying a moment ago – there is a huge problem with the illegal use of child labour. However, we are also talking here about reducing trade barriers, we are talking about improved access to the European market for this product, for cocoa, which – as we have also said here – is an important export product of countries that are very poor. On condition that child labour will not be used in the production of cocoa, we should most definitely support a situation in which a wealthy Europe promotes the development of poor countries by buying this product from them.</p>

Instead, we should ensure that they continue to develop holistically and that we consider their physical, motor, cognitive and intellectual development, and do everything possible to bring that about.</p>
      <p sl="fi">That being the case, we must dissociate ourselves very determinedly and clearly from the use of child labour, and when we conclude agreements on cocoa and other commodities, we also need to ensure that our partners do not expose children to such dangers to save costs.

With the increase in obesity and an ageing population, this number has been projected to increase dramatically over the coming years. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are treatable and, as Type 2 is linked to lifestyle factors, it can be addressed by effective preventative strategies such as increasing exercise and making adjustments to diet.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst health care is a national competence, it is sensible that a joined-up approach is taken and that sharing best practice and enhanced cooperation between Member States, particularly in research and in the development of new tools to diagnose diabetes at an earlier stage, are put into place.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted against Iceland joining the EU because I think, as two-thirds of Icelandic people thought in a poll just last month, that Iceland would be mad to join the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mad because membership would destroy Iceland’s key industry – fishing – through the disastrous common fisheries policy, just as it has destroyed 100 000 jobs in the UK in fishing and nearly all the fishing in my own constituency of the East of England. Mad because they would have to join the disastrous euro as well and abandon the free floating króna, which has brought a boom in exports. Mad, too, because its economy would be weighed down with a barrage of EU red tape. Its growth rate is currently 3.1%, whereas the EU’s GDP forecast is 0 for this year. Why risk it?</p>
      <p sl="en">As for Icesave, there are other legal mechanisms outside the EU, such as the EFTA court, which has already ruled that Iceland must pay up.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we must stop kidding ourselves in the EU that Iceland wants to join. Iceland’s sane option, as I believe Britain’s is too, is to stay proud, independent and self-governing.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is a constituency within the United Kingdom whose advice to Iceland would be to learn from the UK’s mistake and stay out of the EU. Another opinion this Parliament should consider is that, if you apply for membership of any club, you usually precede your application with a clear demonstration of your eligibility for membership by complying with the existing rules of the club.</p>
      <p sl="en">In respect of fisheries management, specifically regarding mackerel, Iceland has ignored such a commitment and wants to rewrite the rules before it joins the club. If this Parliament has any principles, it should send a clear message to Iceland that its behaviour in respect of mackerel is unacceptable and sets a dangerous precedent in terms of how Iceland might flout the EU’s plethora of other regulations.</p>

This country could become an enlargement success story. Its integration can bring economic benefits, but it can also strengthen the EU's foreign policy, with regard as well to the transatlantic relationship. It would also help develop the Arctic dimension of regional policy. Moreover, Iceland's progress can have beneficial effects in terms of stimulating the other candidate countries. At the same time, due attention should be paid to public information and communication, given the existing differences in Iceland regarding the European integration project.</p>

In addition, Brussels’ commitment, as seen in its extension of the role of the Special Representative, allows us to help in efforts for progress on issues related to acceleration of the process of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s accession to the Union.

Almost 20 years ago, this former Yugoslav republic witnessed the most horrific crimes to be committed in Europe since the Second World War.

That is precisely what we are trying to do at the moment. Over the last 20 years, this country has not been able to establish the structures of a unified state. It is not even in a position to draw up a budget for 2012. It is not able to appoint directors of public agencies.

I agree with the Commission proposal to allow an increase in interim payments from the European Fisheries Fund by an amount corresponding to 10% above the actual cofinancing rate for each priority axis for the Member States which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.

      <p sl="it">The sustained financial and economic crisis has put increasing pressure on national financial resources. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of cohesion programmes takes on particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the economy. Nonetheless, the liquidity problems resulting from budget constraints are making it difficult to implement the programmes, particularly in the Member States which have been most affected by the crisis. In order to ensure that the Member States continue the implementation of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the Commission proposes to increase Community cofinancing for the countries facing the greatest difficulties, with a corresponding reduction in the national effort required in order to take up funding. I welcome the Commission’s proposal, although I do share Mr Ferreira’s concerns over some parts of it. The Commission should assess the extent to which this measure will indeed ‘provide the Member States concerned with the funds necessary to support projects and the recovery of the economy’.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because alongside measures designed to encourage greater take-up of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) appropriations by the Member States, the priorities of the EFF itself also need to be reconfigured. Money from the fund should, above all, be focused on supporting productive activity, such as fleet renewal and modernisation, increased sustainability, improved selectivity of fishing gear and the development of coastal communities. The European Commission should assess the extent to which this measure will indeed provide the Member States concerned with the funds necessary to support projects and revive the economy. It should be pointed out that, even under the new conditions, the restrictions on investment imposed by the so-called assistance programmes may still make it difficult to mobilise the national effort required. The Commission will therefore have to consider both the need to lift these restrictions on investment and the possibility of further reducing national cofinancing. The Commission proposal does not increase the budget available for each of the countries that are experiencing difficulties. The practical result of reducing the national effort will be that a comparatively lower overall amount of appropriations will be channelled into investment in the sector. The growth prospects opened up by the investment made will thus also be reduced. The cohesion principle itself is again being called into question, and the Commission should therefore look into the possibility of increasing the funds available to these countries.</p>

The economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing has disproportionately hit coastal communities dedicated to fishing.

The Commission must therefore consider and respond to the reservations and suggestions that we set out in the report, in particular, those regarding the need to increase the funding available to the countries in question. In addition to measures facilitating increased take-up of EFF funds by Member States, the priorities of the EFF itself must be rethought, gearing it primarily towards support for the productive activity and development of coastal communities, for the rejuvenation of the sector, for employment and vocational training, and for the renovation and modernisation of the fleet and of the infrastructure that support the fishing industry. The amendments proposed by the Council under pressure from certain countries, such as Germany, which will eventually also be included in this report owing to the proposal by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), seem to us both superfluous and inappropriate.

Certain Member States are experiencing, or are threatened with, serious difficulties, notably, those connected with problems in terms of economic growth and financial stability and a deterioration in their deficit and debt position, due to the international economic and financial environment. Whilst important actions to counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including amendments to the legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, the labour market and citizens is being widely felt. The pressure on national financial resources is increasing and further steps should now be taken to alleviate that pressure through the maximum and optimal use of the funding from the European Fisheries Fund. This proposal is aimed at ensuring additional pre-financing for European Fisheries Fund programmes for Hungary, Romania, Latvia, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, which receive EU financial support under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the Balance of Payments Mechanism. It is also worth mentioning that this proposal will have no effect on the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The sustained economic crisis is causing enormous disruption in many of the Member States, particularly in the implementation of EU cohesion programmes. The European Commission is proposing a 10% increase in cofinancing under the European Fisheries Fund, which will not affect the overall budget, because the allocation of funds from the European Development Fund will not change in this period.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The changes which have taken place in the fisheries sector during the crisis have principally affected coastal communities, where, for some time now, a fall in investment has been observable which has resulted in imbalances within the EU. Therefore, we need stronger targeting of the European Fisheries Fund than exists at present to support production and guarantee the development of local communities. The proposal to increase assistance for the countries with the greatest problems is very definitely worthy of support. The Commission proposal does not, however, concern Regulation (EC) No 861/2006, which talks about financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy, something which is surely crucial for the sustainable development of this sector.</p>

It also aims to provide better protection for the environment. One important objective is to put an end to overfishing in many European waters and secure the future of the European fisheries industry. Around EUR 3.9 billion in funding is available for the period from 2007 to 2013. Almost EUR 3 billion of this is destined for areas with below-average economic growth.

Following the ban on imports of such beef into the EU, the US and Canada began to impose trade sanctions on agricultural products imported from the EU, such as beef and pork products, cheese, chocolate, juice, etc., and EU producers have consequently lost a significant share of the market, respectively worth USD 116.8 million and CAD 11.3 million a year. In 2009, during bilateral negotiations, an agreement was reached on the gradual lifting of sanctions imposed on EU agricultural products by the US and Canada, in exchange for an autonomous, zero-duty, tariff-rate quota for high-quality beef not treated with hormones. I welcome this proposal increasing US and Canadian quotas for high-quality beef and dismantling barriers to give EU producers access to the markets in these countries.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because the final settlement of the beef hormone dispute should create further momentum towards greater economic and commercial integration between the EU and the US and Canada. Notwithstanding possible differences in opinion, the aim should always be to reach a compromise rather than disrupt bilateral trade. By further dismantling trade barriers with its major trading partners, the European Union is demonstrating its commitment to strengthening this long-standing economic relationship in terms of trade. The Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and their implementation therefore clearly constitute a win-win situation for the trading partners on both sides of the Atlantic. As the US and Canada have already suspended all retaliatory sanctions in the course of 2011, failure to honour the deal on the European side could have very negative political consequences and would damage the transatlantic trade relationship. The conclusion of the legislative procedure will permit the EU to comply with commitments undertaken towards resolving the dispute. Naturally, the Memorandum of Understanding ensures that all beef products shipped under this quota will continue to comply with stringent food safety requirements set out in EU legislation. In particular, doors will not be opened to hormone-treated beef from the US or Canada, or from any other country.</p>

The political value of this measure is of primary importance.

This agreement makes it possible for the Union to keep its ban on hormone-treated beef, in exchange for increased import quotas for high-quality beef from the United States and Canada and the suspension of sanctions against some European products.

This opening up of the European market to hormone-free beef, which may have positive consequences for the export of various EU products, such as beef and pork products, thereby benefiting the major exporting countries, is due, above all, to economic and commercial pressure and threats from the US and Canada. The sanctions imposed on European products are clear evidence of this.

      <p sl="sk">A dispute over beef treated with hormones adversely affected transatlantic trade relations in the area of agricultural products for more than two decades. In 1988, for reasons of consumer protection and food safety, the EU banned imports of beef and meat products that had been treated with certain growth hormones. Although the dispute over beef treated with hormones concerned a relatively small volume of trade, it led to a reduction in trade and had significant consequences on both sides of the Atlantic. Close trading partners entered into a long-running trade dispute. Continued application of retaliatory tariffs on certain European products hampered exports and EU producers subsequently suffered a loss of market share.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Through bilateral negotiations between the EU, the USA and Canada, however, a pragmatic way was eventually found of avoiding the destructive dynamics of trade sanctions. The negotiations have resulted in ‘Memoranda of Understanding’ that will see the gradual lifting of sanctions imposed on EU agricultural products by the USA and Canada, in exchange for an autonomous, zero-duty, tariff-rate quota for high-quality beef not treated with hormones. The Memoranda of Understanding and their application clearly create a situation that is mutually beneficial to the trade partners.

Parliament has taken a step that will allow the European agricultural industry to plan for the future once again and will strengthen transatlantic trade links.</p>

All beef shipped in from the US and Canada under this quota will need to comply with the stringent food safety requirements set out in the EU legislation.

The US and Canada had applied heavy duties to a number of agricultural products and derivatives from the EU, causing serious economic damage to our producers.

The economies of these two regions being so closely linked, these sanctions have had negative effects on both. That is why an amicable solution was sought and is now about to be implemented. I voted in favour of this report because its adoption will put an end to 20 years or more of trade wars with two of our most important trading partners, while keeping a high level of protection for European consumers without seeing too much of a serious impact on the agricultural sector. Indeed, the high-quality meat referred to in this report is simply meat that has not been treated with growth hormones, and is of inferior quality compared to beef produced in Europe. The quotas authorising the import of this meat are limited, so the impact on the European sector will be extremely small.</p>

I support the proposed solution to the trade dispute and am voting in favour of the text. Specifically, the EU will progressively increase its tariff-rate quota for imports of hormone-free high-quality beef to a total of 21 500 tonnes in the first phase, and thereafter to 48 200 tonnes. This will inevitably result in a gradual reduction or suspension of the sanctions imposed on EU products by the United States and Canada. In order to make the implementation process more effective, the timetables for the first and second phases are the same for both the United States protocol and the Canada protocol: the second phase will begin on 1 August 2012 under the terms of both protocols.

      <p sl="nl">The European Parliament is today formally putting an end to one of the most serious trade conflicts ever between the EU and the United States and Canada. This trade dispute arose as a result of the total European ban on the use of hormones in livestock production. From now on, the United States and Canada will, on an annual basis, be allowed to export 48 200 tonnes of high-quality beef which has not been treated with hormones to the EU. In return, the agricultural trade sanctions which have been levied annually on agricultural products, totalling nearly EUR 100 million, will disappear for good. This agreement is of great political significance. The EU has maintained the hormone ban and its own food standards. Despite condemnation by the WTO, the EU market will not be supplied with hormone-treated beef from the US and Canada. All meat imports will be fattened on farms under the supervision of EU inspectors who will ensure that no hormones are administered. The agreement proves that you can consistently apply your own standards on imported agricultural products, even if they are formally in conflict with WTO rulings. In addition, increasing the amount of beef imported from the US and Canada from 21 500 tonnes to 48 200 tonnes per year will not have any negative impact on the European beef market, given that the import quota accounts for only 0.36% of the total EU beef and veal market.</p>

The talks eventually resulted in the conclusion of two Memoranda of Understanding. I am voting for this report, which will enable the European Union to respect the commitments it has made to resolve the dispute with the countries in question. The Memorandum of Understanding will ensure that beef products imported under this quota will continue to meet the strict food-safety requirements provided for in EU legislation.

Choosing trade partners, what to trade and the objectives that should govern trade represents an important instrument of economic sovereignty. In the case of Portugal, for example, loss of this instrument of sovereignty led to very grave harm to countless sectors of the economy and to the country as a whole. Trade policy has become directed towards maximising the profits of big business in the EU’s major powers, to the clear detriment of countries like Portugal and of the weaker economic sectors, which have found themselves exposed to ruthless, destructive competition.

Consequently, the decision-making procedures currently applied for the various implementing measures should therefore be replaced with the procedures for delegated acts or implementing acts.

Attention should be drawn to the fact that the advisory procedure should be used in all cases where it is necessary for the Commission to consult the Member States before taking a decision. In exceptional and critical circumstances, the Commission must be enabled to take immediate measures as quickly as possible. In cases of urgency, the application of the advisory procedure would allow applicable implementing acts to be adopted immediately. The Member States should play an active part and express their position in all stages of decision making on trade policy safeguard measures. Furthermore, the Commission should publish reports in order to keep the European Parliament and citizens properly informed about all aspects of EU trade relations.</p>

When work on the understanding between the institutions started in 2010, the Greens agreed to give the Council an extra 18-month transition period on trade policy measures, under the premise that the Commission would propose a reform of the basic anti-dumping regulation. For the Greens, this is a field in which we hope to establish criteria for ecological dumping. Nothing happened, however, in those 18 months and DG Trade says quite clearly that it does not intend to propose a substantive reform of the anti-dumping regulation. Consequently, in the vote on the Omnibus I proposal in committee, the Greens rejected all amendments proposing a shift to the advisory procedure in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. We did not receive support and, in the end, abstained in the final vote. The reason why we abstained and did not vote against is that, of course – in general terms – we do not favour giving the Council powers which the Parliament does not have, thus creating inequality between the legislators.</p>

As the economic and social crisis continues, Member States are often imposing particularly severe economic and budgetary constraints, accompanied by reduced employment, a slowdown in economic growth, and a reduction in social and other guarantees, which essentially means that it will take even longer for the Member States and the whole of the EU to overcome the crisis. As a solidarity mechanism, the EU budget should not be reduced in 2013 because EU-funded programmes and instruments are intended to contribute to the long-term and sustainable growth of all EU Member States, stimulation of employment and further development of the Member States themselves. I therefore agree that the 2013 budget must be oriented towards the Member States’ economic recovery policies, particularly by investing more in the creation of new jobs, by increasing youth employment, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and other areas referred to in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

The European Commission and the Council cannot continue down the path of austerity that leaves no margin for the requirements of economic growth capable of generating new jobs. We have the duty to identify measures supportive of growth and employment and finally go beyond the mere requirement of balancing investment and austerity. For our part, moreover, there is a pressing need to draw attention to the worrying payment situation: we must not allow a repetition of what happened in 2011 and 2012, and the Council can no longer purport to decide a priori the level of payments based on political considerations, without taking into account the repercussions on past commitments.</p>

When the whole world is treading water and tightening its belt, the European Union seems financially at ease over its own priorities and programmes due to the fact that it is unable to fall into deficit and has the right to draw to a limited but very real extent on national budgets. In other words, Europe has the right to put its hands into our pockets. In France, each year, this little game costs us a staggering EUR 7 billion. That is more than the social security pension fund deficit.</p>

This is exacerbating the crisis in the EU Member States. We need to be more determined to achieve long-term and sustainable growth for all EU Member States, EU added value, employment and the creation of jobs. I believe that there must be a greater focus on Member States’ economic recovery policies, and that we need to invest more in the creation of new jobs, boost youth employment in particular and offer greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises because they are the main engine of the economy, and pay special attention to other areas referred to in the Europe 2020 strategy.

I think the greatest threat to the EU is the alarming rate of unemployment among young people, which now exceeds 20% and, in some countries, is even over 40%. Furthermore, unemployment is now not just a problem for people who are not very well educated, because it is also affecting young people who hold the highest qualifications. This situation has an economic as well as a social aspect, and is a threat to the future social capital of Europe. Therefore, I think it is necessary to stress the funding of action aimed at achieving a rapid improvement of the situation of young people and creating conditions which foster the establishment and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

As you all know, speaking of budgets in times of crisis is not a straightforward activity, especially if we consider the measures taken in every single Member State. Finding a balance between austerity and rigour, on the one hand, and targeted investments with ambitious aims, on the other, is not easy. However, the message that I wanted to send by the report that has just been adopted by a large majority in this Chamber is that we must use the demonstrable added value of the Union budget, as a budget for investment, to propel Europe out of the crisis and promote growth, development and employment, with particular reference to youth employment. These are the aims of our policy measures, these are the answers we wish to give to our citizens, showing them that European resources, used in an efficient and coordinated way, are capable of having a tangible effect on their everyday lives.</p>

At the same time, however, we would like to emphasise that the EU ought, as far as possible, to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget. We therefore supported amendments that were moving in that direction, and we welcome the passages stating that the EU should also identify negative priorities.

The promotion of growth and jobs requires specific actions and enhanced budgetary efforts to support competitiveness, innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises. The tailor-made austerity measures already taken need to be accompanied by targeted investments, resulting in sustainable economic development. The EU budget has a decisive role to play in this context as a tool to ensure prompt and well-coordinated action in all fields in order to mitigate the effects of the crisis on the real economy and to act as a catalyst to boost investment, growth and jobs in Europe.

Economic recovery requires measures to strengthen solidarity and boost sustainable growth and employment. The European Council’s acknowledgement in its statement of 30 January 2012 is therefore important, but it must be stressed that there is a need for concrete measures to be taken, notably by making use of the EU budget as a common instrument.

If the economic heavyweight Spain is not willing to make additional savings in light of the increasing hole in the budget and yet this continues to have no consequences, while Hungary, on account of its alleged failure to meet budgetary objectives, is having its funding stopped, then it seems an example is to be made of Hungary because the right-wing Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, has contravened the prevailing dogmas of political correctness.

The Basel directives need further discussion, particularly with regard to the bureaucratic obstacles faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In many countries in Europe, SMEs are still being held back, which makes economic recovery more difficult. We need to stimulate growth and job creation and take specific measures, including increased budgetary efforts, to promote competitiveness, innovation and SMEs, because the EU’s greatest economic potential lies with SMEs. Recent studies have shown that between 2002 and 2010, they created around 85% of all the new jobs in the EU. This demonstrates that they are the backbone of economic growth.

Effective economic recovery therefore requires measures to restore sovereignty. Europe urgently needs to solve the problems of unemployment and increasing poverty. I believe that it is very important for both the Commission and the Member States to make these problems a priority. Above all, it is crucial for adequate EU funding to continue to be provided to support growth efforts. Specific actions need to be established that would help reduce poverty, and boost growth and jobs, as well as means of supplementing measures and programmes at Member State level from the EU budget. Furthermore, when applying more stringent EU funding standards, we must, above all, support those companies that do not move their operations outside the EU. Specific action must be taken in the area of the budget that would help to support sustainable and long-term industrial policy, competitiveness and SMEs. European Investment Bank support for SMEs and infrastructure should be considered the top priority.</p>

We wish to avoid a repetition of the situation we experienced last December, when the European Commission was unable to honour the contractual commitments that had been made. The topics on which the 2013 budget focuses will be youth employment and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Without denying the importance of these two subjects, I should nevertheless like to make it clear how the issue of agriculture remains key to the development of Europe’s spending policy, where, for a long time now, operators in this sector have been asking for simplification and transparency of the paying agencies, as well as for clarity, above all, as regards the penalties applicable to those who fail to honour the commitments undertaken in the common agricultural policy (CAP).

Since this concerns the creation of a body which facilitates the full functioning of the rule of law throughout the EU, from which European citizens only stand to gain, I voted for this special committee. Its aims are to analyse and evaluate the extent of organised crime, corruption and money laundering and their impact on the Union and its Member States, and to propose appropriate measures to enable the Union to forestall and counter these threats at national, international and European level.</p>

Its establishment also responds to the requests contained in the resolution on the EU’s efforts to combat corruption, initiated by myself and adopted by the European Parliament on 15 September 2011. Organised crime and financial fraud cannot exist without corruption. Organised crime structures use corruption as a tool to gain access to undue resources and information and to make sure that criminal acts cannot be detected and proven. Money laundering acts provide the ‘fuel’ that organised crime structures use to perpetuate corruption. It is obvious that these three types of criminal acts can only be tackled simultaneously. European citizens want to see concrete measures to fight crime in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The committee will examine the extent of organised crime, corruption and money laundering and its impact on the Union, the efficiency of EU home affairs agencies (such as Europol, COSI and Eurojust) in achieving their goals, and will propose measures to tackle these acts simultaneously.

      <p sl="el">According to the European Commission’s recent reply to a question raised by me, over 1% of GDP of the EU Member States (5% globally) is ‘lost’ as a result of corruption and fraud. In Greece, that equates to over EUR 3 billion. However, corruption is not confined to the economy. It runs through various sector of society, such as sport – we need only remember recent events in Germany, Italy and Greece – and justice, to name but two. Therefore, combating and eliminating corruption is not just a moral duty; it is a financial necessity in these difficult times. The decision to set up a European Parliament select committee proves that the European Parliament is committed to examining, legislating and stepping up its efforts to combat organised crime, such as money laundering and corruption.

      <p sl="lt">This report is very important for Lithuania. The Lithuanian economy and society continue to be dogged by corruption. According to the latest data from the Corruption Perceptions Index, of all the European Union Member States, Lithuania is at the bottom of the table, in 19th place. Lithuania scored 4.8 points out of 10 (10 points are given to countries with great transparency). According to data in the report, nine out of ten Lithuanians believe that corruption is the greatest problem facing their country. During a recent visit to Lithuania, the Director of Transparency International stated that lawyers and business people welcome Lithuania’s anti-corruption laws and other legislation, but that the laws themselves are not working. It is right. We urgently need an appropriate guarantee that laws will be enforced. The rapporteur also mentions the problem of organised crime, which sadly is continuing to poison Lithuania. At the beginning of the year, Europol listed Lithuania as one of five organised crime hotspots in Europe, one particularly active in moving narcotics and contraband cigarettes into and out of Russia. The situation will get even worse unless action is taken in the near future. According to data in the international media, it is expected that Lithuania’s shadow economy will account for more than 20% of its GDP by 2015.</p>

This is the only possible way of guaranteeing the fair administration of justice and its role as a moderator in society.

According to the study, language barriers, a lack of timely information on existing programmes, the fact that programmes are not always adapted to judges’ needs, together with judges’ heavy workloads and the lack of relevant funding are among the reasons for the relatively low level of respondents receiving training in EU law (53%, and only one third of them within the last three years). The European judicial area must be built on a shared judicial culture among practitioners, the judiciary and prosecutors which is not only based on EU law but developed through mutual knowledge and understanding of the national judicial systems, a root-and-branch revamping of university curricula, organisation of exchanges, study visits and common training with the active support of the Academy of European Law, the European Judicial Training Network and the European Law Institute.

In this context, I believe that multilingual training is important, as the study shows that only a relatively small number of judges speak a foreign language well enough to be able to participate actively in judicial training in other Member States. One way of resolving the problems (costs, language training, cost-effectiveness) is to utilise modern technology and finance the creation of on-line applications prepared by the national schools, the Academy of European Law, universities and other trainers, which would consist of training courses with video material, including language training (with particular emphasis on legal terminology) and instructions about national legal systems, particular legal procedures and so on. The applications would be provided free of charge to members of the judiciary.

      <p sl="ro">Ongoing professional legal training is of paramount importance to ensuring that not only national but also the European legal system functions efficiently. The benefits which European cooperation in this area could bring are far from insignificant. The exchange of experience among law practitioners has an extremely important role as it is open to interpretation, and the views held by practitioners may differ, even though the subject is the same. Another consideration in addition to this aspect is that legal doctrine is dynamic, and practitioners’ knowledge of the law must be constantly updated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Establishing a ‘European legal culture’ by organising internships at European level, using new ‘apps’ (applications intended for legal training) and by moderating annual forums where judges and prosecutors can exchange their experiences would facilitate the spread of information at European level. This step helps remove existing barriers in the internal market in this area, which will make it easier for lawyers/judges to access legal posts in the EU, while also helping them obtain training at national level. We deserve to have the best lawyers and judges. To achieve this, we need to offer them the opportunity to have training at European level.</p>

Closer contact between judges and other justice-sector professionals from different countries is a fair and important objective, which could have a positive effect on the way justice is administered. Nonetheless, it is important to recognise the pivotal role played by national legislation, which should not be replaced by a single European legal system. The Member States’ legal traditions and the way in which their systems have evolved to fit their specific peoples constitute an important asset which should not give way to a temptation to standardise and centralise.</p>

Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provide for the adoption of measures aimed at ensuring support for the training of justice sector professionals.

This culture was based not only on EU law, but also developed through mutual knowledge and understanding of the national judicial systems, a root-and-branch revamping of university curricula, exchanges, study visits and common training with the active support of the Academy of European Law, the European Judicial Training Network and the European Law Institute.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Judicial training should be linked to a debate on the traditional role of the judiciary and its modernisation. I believe that a common judicial culture also needs to be created among members of the judiciary in order to promote the core values of the judicial profession by discussing and promulgating common professional ethics, the principles of the rule of law and the principles for the appointment and selection of judges, thereby promoting the mutual trust necessary to make the common judicial area a reality.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A further aim would be an effort to coordinate the training provided by existing judicial training schools and to promote dialogue and professional contacts. I also think that multilingual training is no less important, as a study has shown that only a relatively small number of judges speak a foreign language well enough to be able to participate actively in judicial training in other Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Language difficulties, lack of understanding of neighbouring judicial systems, infrequent contacts and exchanges between institutions: these are all obstacles to the construction of a European judicial area. The challenges of judicial training at the level of the European Union are therefore considerable as there can be no construction of a European judicial area if we do not provide appropriate training for those who are the actors within it. Therefore, we must really take this issue in hand and make considerable efforts in relation to judicial training, not only of judges, but also of all other legal practitioners: lawyers, notaries, ombudsmen … in other words, all legal practitioners. There is a clear need today to build a European judicial culture and to do everything in our power to achieve this. We must promote contacts, exchanges and, in particular, I would like to point out the importance of setting up a genuine ‘Erasmus for judges’.</p>

      <p sl="fr">If we want to go further in constructing mutual confidence within the European judicial area, we must, in particular, set up networks between judges of different cultures and improve coordination of existing networks in order to create ‘circles of coherence’. New technologies do indeed enable us to get round budgetary constraints on the organisation of direct contacts which involves considerable movement on the part of judges, but electronic communication is not enough. The creation of a forum at which judges can meet each other is essential, as is the involvement of judges from the Luxembourg and Strasbourg Courts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, it is necessary to improve the coordination of the training provided by the existing judicial training schools and to facilitate and promote dialogue and contacts between practitioners in this sector. Without this, we will find ourselves again in a few years’ time lamenting that we have made too little progress.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to remind the honourable Members that the question of judicial training cooperation arose at EU level as a Hungarian initiative, and was a priority in the programme of the Hungarian Presidency. In this field, the problem is that although European Union legislation is gaining pace, a significant proportion of the national judges in the Member States know very little about EU sources of law and do not speak foreign languages to the extent of being familiar with the legal terminology of the other Member States. The first step should involve making training accessible to European Union legal experts and creating a system that ensures multilingual training. In the absence of the establishment of new institutions, a starting point could be to establish cooperation between existing national training institutions and to place greater emphasis on comparative and international legal studies. The European justice area needs to build on a common judicial culture, which, in my view, is founded on both European Union law and common knowledge of the national justice systems.</p>

The comparative study on judicial training in Member States, commissioned by Parliament and carried out by the Academy of European Law in collaboration with the European Judicial Training Network, has highlighted the existence of linguistic barriers and the lack of information (available in good time) regarding existing programmes, and the fact that programmes are not always adapted to judges’ needs.

      <p sl="lt">As the rapporteur observes, reducing the politicisation of the legal system is essential for the strength and well-being of Lithuanian democracy. Unfortunately, this area is much neglected in Lithuania. Public confidence in the Lithuanian legal system remains very low. According to the latest data from the Freedom House organisation, in 2011, public distrust of courts grew dramatically in Lithuania, reaching 44%. The report stresses the need for judicial reform. The small changes that have slowly been achieved are not enough. Suspects arrested are not always given legal assistance in a timely manner, and lengthy periods of detention on remand remain a problem. Freedom House notes that there are still reports of illegal police actions against detainees, including minors, and the response of judges and prosecutors to such actions is inadequate. The deficiencies of the Lithuanian legal system are a crucial part of a greater problem. According to the latest studies carried out by Bertelsmann, only 50% of Lithuanians believe that they live in a state where all political rights are granted. I agree with the rapporteur and believe that we should try to strengthen the core values of the judicial profession and create a judicial culture.

While the resolution recognises that producers face strong pressures to keep labour costs down, it calls on cocoa growers and processors, governments, traders, producers, and us as consumers of chocolate, to live up to their responsibilities in combating forced child labour and trafficking in this sector.

      <p sl="hu">I supported the motion for a resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector, since the protection of children is of prime importance not only in Europe, but throughout the world. It is precisely for that reason that the European Union needs to use all possible means at its disposal, whether that be concluding an international agreement, working out economic alternatives for the countries concerned or, if all else fails, exercising economic pressure. In my opinion, governments need to use legal means to put pressure on the public to ensure that a child’s main commitment is school, since education is one of the foundation stones of development. Where governments fail to do so of their own accord, it is the duty of the international community to exert pressure on governments. For that reason, I regard the withdrawal of trade preferences during the review of the European Union’s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and the use of legally binding clauses in trade agreements, including measures to be applied in the event of infringements, as referred to in the motion for a resolution, as appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">What this ignores, however, is that many of the clauses demanded are already written into certain agreements, but are dead letters, never being implemented in practice; however, they are always, always being subordinated to business and profit. There is no focus here on the real reasons for the use of child labour, specifically, the socio-economic conditions of farmers and workers on these cocoa plantations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The resolution makes some pertinent observations on the pressure to reduce labour costs in the cocoa fields. Lamentably, however, no solutions are proposed to counter these pressures and bring about the necessary wage increases for these workers.</p>

The European Union cannot turn a blind eye to this utterly unacceptable situation which is dreadful in human terms. These children work in extremely dangerous conditions, they are frequently exposed to pesticides, and many are victims of human trafficking. I therefore strongly voted in favour of the annex to this resolution, which follows Parliament’s consent to the renewal of the International Cocoa Agreement in terms of production and commerce.

We all enjoy giving our children Easter Eggs, but if one thinks of the conditions of the West African children in the cocoa regions, it takes away the fun of Easter. Ten years ago, the big chocolate companies promised to get rid of child trafficking in the cocoa industry in West Africa, but there is still only a tiny amount of ‘Traffick Free’ chocolate.

Even though much of this child labour is carried out within the family framework, this is a disturbing situation. I therefore think that the problem of the worst forms of child labour needs to be resolved urgently. The resolution does indeed recognise that producers face strong pressures to keep labour costs down, but calls on cocoa producers, EU political leaders, and consumers to live up to their responsibilities in combating child labour.

I believe that any work carried out by children should be considered child labour and the aim is to eliminate it.

I very positively welcomed the decision to link the adoption of the agreement to a resolution and a Commission statement on child labour in the cocoa sector: the issue certainly merits separate treatment, given its crucial relevance in the field of children’s rights.

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation, drafted by Mr Moreira, deals with the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the International Cocoa Agreement 2010 by the EU. Conclusion of this agreement has been delayed, owing to the widespread use of child labour in this sector. West Africa produces 70% of the world’s cocoa and about 7.5 million people work in cocoa production in that region, almost exclusively on family smallholdings. This facilitates recourse to child labour, in a society in which there are neither alternatives for wealth creation nor opportunities for young people once they have finished school. The majority of chocolate consumed in Europe is produced using child labour. Since defending values, namely, human rights and, in particular, children’s rights, is one of the core values of the EU, it cannot establish commercial ties with organisations or countries which exploit child labour. I voted for this report because not only does it strongly condemn the use of child labour in cocoa fields, but it also urges the governments of the countries involved in this issue to ratify and/or comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the conventions of the International Labour Organisation.</p>

It is difficult, but not impossible, to change this situation.

Therefore, I am in favour of the renewal of the International Cocoa Agreement. Cocoa consumption in developed countries, especially in Europe, is higher than in the developing countries where it is grown. In return for the privilege of reaping the economic benefits of selling this commodity, Europe must be prepared to abide by certain standards. In order for this market to sustain itself, efforts dedicated to environmental protection need to be maintained. Responsible growing and harvesting practices must be respected. In addition, cocoa producers need to be adequately remunerated. It is much too easy in a system like this to ensure that the majority of the profits wind up in the hands of the people who simply market the product, not in the hands of those who actually produce it. Certainly, in order for these and other standards not mentioned here to be met, transparency is key. Consumers are more than ever concerned with the weight of their spending power.

Nonetheless, the new agreement did not, however, tackle the problem of child labour. That is why Parliament adopted a resolution calling for measures against the use of child labour in this sector. Cocoa cultivation is a highly labour intensive activity: 90% of world cocoa is cultivated by 5.5 million smallholders, and 14 million rural workers directly depend on its production, including children. The resolution calls on all parties in the cocoa value chain to live up to their responsibilities in combating forced child labour and trafficking in the sector. Furthermore, Parliament calls on the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal to combat effectively cocoa-based products derived from child labour and to encourage those countries that are signatories to the agreement reached at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to act to guarantee traceability along the entire supply chain.</p>

The sustained efforts of national health authorities and the improvement of the cooperation framework at EU level are essential for reversing these trends representing an extremely serious public health concern.

The European Parliament therefore calls on the Commission to develop and implement a targeted EU diabetes strategy on diabetes prevention, diagnosis, management, education and research.

      <p sl="pt">Diabetes is the most common non-communicable disease, affecting more than 32 million people in the European Union, according to estimates, representing nearly 10% of the total EU population. On top of this, the same number of citizens suffer from impaired glucose tolerance and have a very high probability of progressing to clinically manifest diabetes. Unfortunately, a 16% increase in the number of people living with diabetes in Europe is expected by 2030, as a result of the obesity epidemic, the ageing of the European population and other factors yet to be determined. It is known that Type 2 diabetes decreases life expectancy by five to 10 years and that Type 1 diabetes decreases life expectancy by around 20 years. Overall, 325 000 deaths per year are attributed to diabetes in the EU; that is, one European every two minutes. The reduction of identified risk factors, notably, lifestyle habits, is increasingly being recognised as a key prevention strategy able to reduce the incidence, prevalence and complications for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. As such, the factors mentioned in this motion for a resolution are key to effectively combating the diabetes epidemic.</p>

In addition, many diabetic patients are the victims of discrimination and prejudice is still rife in schools, employment agencies and workplaces, and also in terms of insurance policies, for which the premiums for an appropriate level of cover are often exorbitant. The Commission must urgently define and implement a targeted EU diabetes strategy and support the actions of Member States. Member States must develop national diabetes programmes and promote Type 2 diabetes and obesity prevention through strategies to be implemented from an early age through education about healthy dietary and physical activity habits in schools.

According to estimates, more than 32 million EU citizens, constituting nearly 10% of the European population, are affected by it. The main reasons for this are, on the one hand, the ageing population, which is why we can expect an increase of 16% by 2030, and, on the other, unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as poor nutrition and too little exercise. Since we still do not have a cure for diabetes, people need to reconsider their lifestyles and eat more healthily and participate in more sport.

In the European Union, 325 000 people die from diabetes each year, in other words two people every two minutes. Research by Vilnius University has shown that diabetes-related mortality has grown constantly in Lithuania over the last two decades. As the report shows, this disease is mostly associated with obesity. The rate of obesity in Lithuania is over 20%, the second highest rate in the European Union, and 5% more than the Union average. According to a report published by the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 50.1% of Europeans are obese, twice as many as 20 years ago. Diabetes and obesity cost human health and health care systems dear. In their report, the European Commission and the OECD indicate that they have calculated a 70% increase in health care expenditure for European Union Member States over 2007-2015 due to the spread of diabetes. In Lithuania, more than 10% of all money earmarked for health care is spent on treating diabetes.

Of course, what is most important is prevention and making it possible for people to have free prophylactic and diagnostic tests, such as blood sugar level, blood pressure, adipose tissue and body weight tests. It will also be essential to provide advice on diabetes on a wide scale. The Member States should implement comprehensive programmes which aim to raise the awareness of the EU’s citizens about the causes of the very high incidence of diabetes, which include improper diet, eating foods which have low nutritional value but are full of ‘empty calories’, lack of exercise, sitting for too long at work, overfeeding children and so on.

The motion for a resolution has numerous positive points, but it also has seriously problematic points which, ultimately, prevented me from voting in favour of it, as I would have wished. Generally speaking, it is less balanced than the reports for the previous two years, which the Greek Greens voted in favour of. The solution to the name must indeed include solutions in terms of acceptance of the ethnic and linguistic self-determination of FYROM, with one eye on the future and on terms that do not undermine the right of other ethnic groups in the historic/geographical area of Macedonia as a whole from calling themselves Macedonians, should they so wish. At this point, the statements made in paragraph 15 of the motion are seriously problematic and will not help to provide motivation and time for truly convincing solutions. The motion should be an opportunity to resolve the problem through dialogue and a mutually acceptable compromise, by making use of the procedure for FYROM to accede to the European structures and laying down a timetable for it. The reference here to the recent precedent of the solution to differences between Croatia and Slovenia is positive as a condition for completion of Croatia’s accession to the EU.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the fact that Macedonia was the first among the countries concerned to be granted candidate status. The Balkan region has key significance to the European Union, and is particularly important to Hungary as well. We must therefore leave no country behind. Over the past few years, Macedonia undertook several efforts and laboured relentlessly towards becoming a Member State of the European Union. In terms of establishing a market economy, it is approaching EU norms. The changes implemented in the fields of justice and administration, the reduction of decentralisation and the efforts made in the area of human rights all prove that the country is committed to Europe. It is, of course, important to note that there still remain ethnic issues, such as the matter of the Bulgarian minority, and there is also still headway to be made in terms of reducing corruption and increasing the transparency of public expenditures; overall, however, the country is on the right track and I hope that it will cooperate with the European Union in taking all necessary measures. At the same time I find it sad that a debate over a country’s name can stand in the way of its future development. We need a much more open-minded approach than that.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The position of the majority of this Parliament, in wanting to bring forward the date for starting negotiations, disrespects the sovereignty of both countries and only contributes to exacerbating the existing divisions.

EU accession is a process of sovereign decisions for every people, as is the path to follow for economic and social development. Every people has the right to make a free decision about EU accession, without interference and following an open, informed and far-reaching debate based on reality and not on fantasies that never materialise.</p>

The country continues to implement accession-related reforms, though core challenges remain.

It is important to deepen political dialogue and to address the issue of parliament as a key democratic institution for the discussion and resolution of problems arising from differing political views.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Regarding economic development, the country is achieving some good economic results, and is striving to maintain macro-economic stability. The potential for investment, trade and economic development remains a vital reason to continue the process of the country’s accession to the EU.</p>

How can we gladly welcome new countries into the costly and ineffective gasworks that is the European Union? From the outside, they often see only an appearance of prosperity in which they want to participate. From the inside, we have to put up with its bureaucratic and pointlessly restrictive aspects. We continue to negotiate Iceland’s accession, demanded by opportunism at the height of the Icelandic banking crisis, even though the vast majority of people are opposed to it, as next year’s referendum will undoubtedly show. We want the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia to join the European Union quickly and prematurely, without having resolved any of the conflicts that those countries may have with their neighbours, including EU Member States, and without talking about their lack of preparation from an economic, legal and administrative perspective and the confrontational relations between their ethnic and religious communities, which we are going to import. In short, this headlong rush, in the midst of a crisis, while the EU’s absorption capacity is far from proven, is worse than an error: it is faulty.</p>

The healthy development of the economy and the legal basis of its operation are to be welcomed. As with every country which is going through a period of change and laying the foundations of its own statehood, Macedonia is experiencing difficulties with unemployment, social exclusion and corruption.

There is an astonishing twenty-fold over-representation of Roma children in special schools, the lack of personal documents and the extremely high unemployment still remains an unresolved problem and the percentage of children living under the poverty line even increased, reaching a shocking level of 37%. Discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin is still wide-spread, especially affecting Roma women and reports of police brutality, and the use of excessive force against Roma are a concern. It is necessary to promote dialogue between local authorities, judicial bodies, police and the Roma communities in order to abolish discrimination, to improve confidence and to combat ethnic profiling. The general lack of coordination and evaluation mechanisms can only be remedied by joining the European Framework for National Roma Inclusion Strategies and elaborating a national long-term strategy for Roma inclusion, including the necessary cross-sector, complex and territorially targeted development projects.</p>

I welcome the decision of the Court of Justice of 5 December 2011, which could give a new impetus to solving the name dispute. In the case of each accession, the EU should be clear on its open-minded approach and use of pro-European language. It is high time now to look to the future and leave the past aside. The dispute between neighbours on the name issue has alarmingly delayed the start of the accession negotiations and harmed the image and credibility of the EU in the eyes of that country’s citizens. I am aware that the present name of FYROM is insulting to the citizens of that country. In the absence of another agreed term, the transition formula ‘Future EU Member State of Macedonia’ could be used.

I welcome this decision. Now, the Council should reflect the Court’s decision and immediately follow the recommendation of the European Commission by giving Macedonia a start date for its accession negotiations. The name issue between Macedonia and Greece is exclusively a bilateral issue and, as such, it should not interfere with the opening of accession negotiations. Progress has been made in the judiciary and the fight against corruption. I encourage the authorities to continue improving the independence, efficiency and resources of the judiciary and would stress that the unification of jurisprudence and publishing all court decisions are vital for the predictability of the judiciary and public trust in the system.

Macedonia should therefore increase its efforts to properly implement media freedom and pluralism in the country and combat corruption more effectively, as well as the high level of unemployment and poverty.

The dispute with Greece within the UN over the naming of FYROM should not create obstacles to the country’s integration into the EU, since the country is committed to implementing the EU acquis , and to the second stage of the stabilisation and association agreement. What is more, FYROM has demonstrated good economic performance, while still showing some weaknesses, namely, in terms of judicial independence, the impartiality of the administration, the challenges of unemployment and high levels of poverty. I would also highlight the fact that the country has moved up 40 places in the Corruption Perceptions Index over the last five years, as well as the efforts made by the government in the areas of inter-ethnic conflict resolution, and the need for more policies targeting the entirety of the population, without ethnic discrimination. I am voting for this motion for a resolution, since the EU has a vital role to play in continued reforms in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>

Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations remain essential parts of the enlargement process. I welcome the progress made in modernising transport, energy and telecommunications networks. In view of the importance of the railway links as an alternative to road transport, I welcome the government’s intention to upgrade or construct railway links from Skopje to the capitals of the neighbouring countries. I encourage continuing efforts to implement the Bologna Process in higher education and cooperation with other countries in this region in order to enhance the quality of its universities. I call on the government to make more efforts to address structural unemployment and protect vulnerable groups, especially by means of sustainable economic growth and through the creation of a favourable business environment. With this in mind, I call on the government to support small and medium-sized enterprises by making it easier for them to access funding. I should say that I am concerned about the modest progress made on workers’ and trade union rights. I call on the authorities to strengthen further the right to work and trade union rights and for more efforts to be made to align national legislation with the EU acquis in this area.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Like other republics of the former Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) is unstable and has a destabilising influence on the entire region. Firstly, the problem of negotiations with Greece on the country’s name remains; a process replete with nationalist rhetoric that is driving these peoples apart, rather than bringing them closer together. The position of the majority of this Parliament, in wanting to bring forward the date for starting negotiations, disrespects the sovereignty of the peoples of both countries and only contributes to exacerbating the existing divisions. The majority in Parliament justifies its position with interest in FYROM joining NATO, a process that is inseparable from the militarisation of the EU and the enlargement of its spheres of influence into the strategic region of the Balkans. EU accession is a process of sovereign choice for every people, as is the right to economic and social development. All peoples have the right to make a free choice about EU accession, without any outside interference and following an open, informed and far-reaching debate based on reality and not on myths that are never realised, as in the Portuguese case.</p>

I hope that the fisheries negotiations, currently one of the most critical issues, will also soon be resolved with an agreement able to accommodate the interests of all the parties involved.

From an economic point of view, the situation in the country is improving slowly but surely. From a political point of view, it has a long tradition of democracy and cooperation with Northern Europe, and it is very active in Euro-Atlantic cooperation. The fact that the majority of Icelanders support the accession negotiations is a clear sign that the people of Iceland want to move closer to European standards in all areas.

      <p sl="hu">We are very pleased to note that Iceland has managed to steer the negotiations in the right direction, despite the fact that there are certain chapters where an agreement has yet to be reached. Iceland is an integral part of the accession process, but it is important to note that within the framework of the EU policy, it is our obligation to also take account of the country’s specificities and expectations. One reason to settle the issue of fishing as soon as possible is that the population is treating Iceland’s fisheries policy, which accounts for 5% of the country’s economy and is radically different from that of the EU, as a matter of priority. Important to both parties, this subject could contribute considerably to the populace, which is otherwise averse to the EU, ultimately not rejecting accession.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We therefore need joint efforts to address future challenges, and it is important in particular in the field of fishing to reach an agreement that is beneficial to both sides. I am certain that the Danish Presidency and the European Commission will do everything in their power to promote these negotiations. Iceland has much to offer to the EU, and the EU, in turn, also has much to offer to Iceland. The country has always been an integral part of Europe. Iceland’s accession negotiations are unlike others seen over the past few years, as this insular country is part of the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area, cooperates in several other respects with the EU, and also applies its legislation. Accordingly, Iceland’s ambitions must be treated as a matter of extreme importance.</p>

This is a country that is already in the single market and the Schengen area, that has a highly professional government, that is undergoing a financial recovery process already marked by success, as its reclassification by the ratings agencies shows, and that has a team that is very committed to the integration process. There remain some issues to be resolved, particularly as regards fisheries, but in other areas, such as the transposition of EU directives, it is showing itself to be more efficient than many Member States.

      <p sl="en">I rather doubt that Iceland wants to join the EU, or indeed that it is in Iceland’s best interests. But if that is what the people want, then we should support them. Iceland has had close ties with the UK for hundreds of years, is a NATO ally, has a deeply-entrenched democracy and occupies a geographical position of strategic importance. But it has been badly damaged in its self-inflicted banking crisis. There are also sticking points. One, inevitably, is the Icesave issue: it is important that the British and Dutch Exchequers, which bailed out British and Dutch depositors after the 2008 bankruptcy of Icesave Bank, are compensated. I understand that progress is being made on this issue outside the accession procedure. There is also a dispute over Icelandic mackerel quotas. The UK opposes the current increase in Iceland’s mackerel quota as this is not sustainable and is damaging British interests. I therefore abstained on this report.</p>

The EU is extending its hand to Iceland, a founding member of NATO and a country with an important geostrategic position, due to its proximity to the Arctic and to the dispute about sovereignty over the region’s unexploited natural resources, particularly oil and gas. The majority in Parliament are using this report to put pressure on Iceland’s political parties and government to accept the neoliberal measures that have led to the serious crisis being faced by the country, which is having extremely serious social consequences. That is why they are demanding that the Icelandic authorities implement economic reforms, lift capital controls, and open up the energy, air transport and fishing industries, whilst rejecting any measures to protect its economy and workers. The concerns guiding this majority are clear when they take the side of the major banks in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, expressing satisfaction at payments to ‘creditors’ whilst ignoring that they are responsible for the crisis and passing responsibility for paying to the Icelandic people The people of this country have set a significant example in combativeness in fighting to defend their sovereignty and in rejecting these backward social steps.</p>

Croatia will join the EU in 2013 and Serbia has now been granted candidate status. If Bosnia and Herzegovina wants to apply for candidate status this year, all of its political leaders need to deliver for its people.

However, it is important to stress Bosnia and Herzegovina’s good cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, to which it has responded promptly and adequately.

However, I agree with the representatives of the Commission and the Council who stressed that Bosnia and Herzegovina must remain active and reform its constitutional arrangements and legal system, agree on fiscal measures, ensure the formation of civil society, respect and implement human and social rights, and find means of stopping corruption, radicalisation and trafficking in human beings. The European Parliament calls on the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be determined and united to achieve reforms and progress so that its people can live in a country, which is stable politically and growing stronger economically. I voted in favour of this report because I agree that the principles and objectives of the European Union’s policies are helping the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and cooperation must continue so that this country can achieve greater progress.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted against this resolution, even if I agree with some of the conclusions contained in Ms Pack’s report. I am not convinced by the underlying theory, the concept that, despite the critical areas, the EU accession process of Bosnia and Herzegovina should take place without pause for thought. There are still too many question marks about the real authority of the Balkan state. There are too many concerns about the effective independence of the judicial system, which is an indispensable requirement for guaranteeing the rule of law. Finally, too many criticisms can be levelled at the country with regard to its economy. In order for the European Union to be a driver of growth and political stability, it is fundamental that there should be a certain level of convergence between Member States, and Bosnia and Herzegovina does not currently have this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Union is key to bringing this part of the Balkans closer to the EU. However, there are a number of obstacles to be overcome, such as the failings in the way the legal system operates, increasing corruption in the state apparatus, the high level of unemployment and the difficulty of cooperating with other countries in the region, Kosovo in particular. Moreover, since this is a multi-ethnic society, there is a need for close cooperation between the various stakeholders, so that they are better able to speak with one voice. As such, this report is of the greatest importance to the objective of speeding up the country’s progress towards EU accession.</p>

      <p sl="it">Bosnia and Herzegovina has been recognised as a potential candidate since as far back as the Thessaloniki Summit of 2003. The country has been engaged in the Stabilisation and Association Process since 2000, but the related stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) was only signed in 2008 and has not yet come into force, meaning that the request for Union accession has still not been officially made. The last Member State’s ratification of the SAA in February 2011 ought to have led to its entry into force within 40 days, but the failure to comply with the obligations arising from preceding agreements made by Bosnia and Herzegovina has stopped the SAA in its tracks. The obligations in question relate to the adoption of laws on State aid, the national census and implementing the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, which entail a constitutional amendment in order to extend electoral eligibility to members of ethnic minorities. Despite the ongoing difficulties of the domestic political situation, I think it is still decidedly in our interest to retain the country’s ties to Europe, as this is the only way to ensure stability and progress. In the current situation, an increased EU presence on the ground is key and could help give fresh impetus to the internal reform process and, hence, the country’s European prospects.</p>

      <p sl="en">While further progress is still to be made in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly with respect to strengthening the central government and its institutions, I welcome the progress that has been made as outlined in the country’s enlargement report. Nevertheless, further reforms need to be carried out in areas such as the judiciary, protection of minorities, the economy and fighting corruption, which is hindering the socio-economic and political development of the country. The apparent rise of extremism needs to be investigated and appropriate action should be taken to eliminate this threat. The increased EU presence in the country, in the guise of an EU representative with a dual mandate of EU Special Representative and Head of Delegation responsible for offering advice, should assist the political process further.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The EU should continue its support for consolidating the territorial, social and economic cohesion of Bosnia and Herzegovina by stepping up its presence, specifically through the creation of a representative, and the technical and specialised support it has been providing through the EU Police Mission. There are a variety of structural problems affecting this country, which was devastated by the war in Yugoslavia and is still today suffering the tragic effects thereof. High levels of corruption; lack of confidence; the absence of a central government that provides both autonomy for local authorities and cohesive representation for all Bosnian citizens; lack of respect for differences in a multi-ethnic society; failure to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; low levels of growth and high levels of unemployment; and the lack of independence of the judiciary are some of the problems faced by Bosnian society. Following the agreement to form a government, Bosnia and Herzegovina is called on to start working towards the structural reforms required if they are to accede to the 27 in the future, which will bring the stability necessary for the region’s development at the same time.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the European Parliament resolution on the 2011 progress report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. The prospect of EU membership is one of the most unifying factors among the people of this country. I should emphasise the key role played by education in creating a multi-ethnic society and promoting an inclusive, non-discriminatory education system. I think that the quality of education needs to be improved to meet the demand of the labour market. With this in mind, I call on the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities to remedy the shortcomings in vocational training in order to attract foreign direct investment, as well as to ensure that the accreditation of education institutions gets under way and the agencies dealing with the recognition of diplomas become fully operational. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, workers’ and trade union rights are still limited. I call on the government to enhance these rights further and work towards harmonising the legal framework in this regard across the country.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the implementation of the Small Business Act and the efforts to provide financial support measures to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). I should stress the importance of setting up a register for compiling economic statistics and a single SME registration system for the entire country, which will help the number of SMEs grow and create a specific status for them.</p>

      <p sl="de">The start of the accession negotiations with Serbia represents a historic milestone because the European perspective that is now possible for the Balkans could finally put an end to the deadlock in the former Yugoslavia. The current government in Serbia has contributed greatly to the removal of major obstacles. It deserves respect for that. More than 15 years after Dayton, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina still remains far behind what would have been expected and what should have been possible. The former partners in conflict are blocking each other. It is the leadership of the Serbian entity that stands out in particular as a result of a lack of sensitivity. Influential circles are still working to bring about the collapse of the state. However, it is essential, now more than ever, that we insist on the inviolability of the integrity of the state. That is the only way that we can ensure the permanent achievement of what we all need: peace and prosperity in the countries of the Western Balkans.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At today’s vote, I endorsed the document on the 2011 progress report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. After many months of stagnation, Bosnia and Herzegovina has once again chosen the path to European integration. There is certainly still much to be done. Changes to the constitution, improvement of the justice system and initiation of a wide range of political and economic reforms are unavoidable. Drawing up a long-term vision for development in the area of business is particularly important for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has the worst figures in the region in terms of attractiveness to investment. Restoring trust and creating investor-friendly conditions by removing administrative barriers and establishing the right legal framework will contribute to further economic growth, which will lead to a reduction in unemployment and greater prosperity for the population.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This resolution supports maintaining Bosnia as a protectorate of the EU, thereby contributing to keeping open the wounds of a civil war for which the great powers of the EU and NATO bear most of the responsibility. The majority in Parliament support the ‘strengthened’ EU Special Representative and continuation of the EU military operation, EUFOR Althea, rather than an end to their mandates. Instead of helping to heal the open wounds, the majority in Parliament are feeding the same situation of permanent instability that has afflicted the whole region since the end of Yugoslavia. EU accession must be essentially a sovereign decision by each people. A people without sovereignty – and the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are without it – will be severely constrained in their decision regarding accession.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">I would like to announce an apology from the Vice-President of the Commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. It has been agreed that Baroness Ashton will be represented by the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Piebalgs, and by Mr Søvndal, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country holding the Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to express, both on my own behalf and on behalf of the High Representative, my most sincere and heartfelt condolences to all the parents and families in Belgium who have suffered such terrible losses in today’s tragic accident in Switzerland. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims and with the Belgian people.</p>
      <p sl="en">After that, I will turn to Russia. Mr President, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to be here again today to discuss with you the outcome of the presidential elections in Russia on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first of all thank Parliament for the strong voice it has consistently given to European citizens’ concerns about democracy, fair elections and human rights in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia is our largest neighbour; it is an important business partner and a strategic partner on many global and regional issues. So it matters to our citizens what the situation is with regard to human rights and the rule of law in Russia. Parliament followed both the Russian State Duma elections on 4 December and the presidential elections on 4 March very closely. It has adopted several resolutions expressing the expectations of European citizens that Russia will live up to her international commitments to ensure free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">You have also given High Representative/Vice-President Ashton several opportunities to address the plenary on these crucial issues. In addition, several hearings, organised by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Subcommittee on Human Rights, the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and individual political groups, have taken place since December on these elections and on human rights more generally. Catherine Ashton has asked me to thank Parliament for all this important work. She also asked me, in particular, to convey the message that she shares Parliament’s concerns about the case of the arrest and death in pre-trial detention of lawyer, Sergey Magnitsky.</p>
      <p sl="en">Restrictive measures are a sensitive instrument that should be considered in specific situations and in accordance with the respective EU guidelines.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European External Action Service is currently looking into possible ways to convey our expectation that the investigation of this case will be taken forward properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Russian presidential election went largely as expected. OSCE and Council of Europe observers gave a clear evaluation: opportunities were not equal during the preparations, and procedural violence occurred during the voting and counting process itself. We agree with their preliminary report and will remind Russia of its international commitment to free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton issued a statement the day after the elections with five main elements. She recognised the clear victory of Vladimir Putin, noted international observers’ recognition of the significant civic engagement in these elections, referred to international observers’ findings of irregularities, encouraged Russia to address these shortcomings and looked forward to working with the incoming President and new government on our shared modernisation agenda, which should cover both economic and political reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The day after the elections, outgoing President Medvedev instructed the Prosecutor General to examine the verdicts handed down to 32 convicts considered by the opposition as political prisoners, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his former business partner, Platon Lebedev. The President has also ordered the Justice Ministry to prepare a report on the legal reasons for denying the registration of Mikhail Kasyanov’s, Boris Nemtsov’s and Vladimir Ryzhkov’s People’s Freedom Party. These are encouraging signals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next step: we have a strong consensus in the EU that we must engage with Russia – critically, yes, but also constructively. Without Russia, we cannot solve the regional challenges in our common neighbourhood, in Syria or Iran, or most of the pressing global challenges such as climate change and the environment. This approach has been quite successful recently. With Medvedev and the government led by Mr Putin, we have been able to build more constructive relations and to achieve results. Russian WTO accession is one key result that will bind this large economy into the international rules-based framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Partnership for Modernisation is another one. Many projects have already been prepared and launched, including technical and regulatory modernisation as well as reforms of the judiciary and civil society involvement. We have also begun a process on common steps to be fulfilled before we could consider launching negotiations on a visa-waiver agreement. All of this will be of mutual benefit.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new civic and political awakening in Russia has already led to some political reforms, with the first Duma reading of bills introduced by President Medvedev to liberalise political party registration rules and presidential candidates’ registrations and to reinstall direct elections of regional governors.</p>
      <p sl="en">The process is encouraging and will have consequences, especially in Russia’s many regions. Change may be slower than one would hope, but we should have patience. It is a good thing that both authorities and protesters want gradual evolution, not revolution. A cautious but real dialogue has begun between them, and the quality and dynamics of the political situation in Russia have changed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key issue for us now is how we can support this reform process. The bilateral initiatives just mentioned provide us with an excellent basis to build on. As Cathy Ashton has stated, the EU looks forward to working with the incoming Russian President and the new government in full support of our shared modernisation agenda. The next major step in our Strategic Partnership, apart from all the ongoing regular work, will be the next EU-Russia Summit, due to be held in Russia just before the summer.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thank you and look forward to hearing your views and to your resolution, which will be adopted tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate on Russia is of great concern to us and forces us to choose between what is desirable and what is possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">The resolution that Parliament will have to vote on tomorrow addresses the very specific set of circumstances that have followed the presidential elections.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are faced with an official Russia which still harks back to the era of the Soviet Union and which feels entitled to veto freedom within the United Nations Security Council. This is a Russia where the President and the Prime Minister shamelessly take turns to be in power. A Russia where elections are not held in compliance with international standards, and a Russia where opposition figures are detained, which takes us back to the recent and far from glorious past.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, Mr President, this is also a Russia which is a member of the Council of Europe and of the World Trade Organisation, which duly collaborates with the OECD and wishes to become one of its members, and a Russia where, as in the Arab Spring countries, there are men and women who are fighting for their freedom and dignity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think what is central to this resolution is to work for change and to open a space for dialogue and conversation with the opposition whose rights have been infringed and ignored.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should leave until later, until Mr Swoboda’s report, the issue of the institutional framework, the new association agreement between the European Union and Russia, two entities that need to come to an understanding.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I think that from the viewpoint of the European Union – I would like to appeal to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission’s representative – that we should mobilise all our efforts and influence to make what is desirable become possible, so that fundamental freedoms and the rights of all will soon become a reality throughout Russia.</p>

    <intervention id="3-411-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, in recent times, we have, in fact, seen two elections in Russia that we could not describe as free and fair. Progress has been made compared with previous elections, but this progress is slight and, to a certain extent, it has been eliminated and the situation has deteriorated as a result of the behaviour of some leading officials.</p>
      <p sl="de">In both cases, the problem started with the registration of the candidates. Many candidates who would doubtless have been permitted in other countries were not even able to take part in the elections. I believe that there is no justification for this, as the conditions set out for this are designed right from the start to make it impossible for some candidates to stand for election.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we have to be critical of the reporting in various sections of the media, which was not at all balanced, in particular, in the electronic media, of course – after all, television is the most important media these days – even though the purely formal election broadcasts were fairly reasonably distributed. However, if Mr Putin took every opportunity to be seen as an animal lover and rescuer of the Siberian tiger, in whatever capacity, that is also clearly an indirect form of election campaigning.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, there were also various instances of pressure being applied during voting, with the result that we are, unfortunately, having to give this critical appraisal of the elections. That met with unwillingness, incomprehension and resistance – which is also a sign of the progress of democracy and progress in the development of Russia. After all, whatever criticisms we have, people in Russia nevertheless now have the courage, to a greater extent than ever before, to go out onto the streets and demonstrate. It is then clear that some of our reactions should be rejected and repudiated. Thus, we absolutely must express our criticism if, for example, demonstrators are treated brutally or are imprisoned, at least for a time. These are things that we cannot tolerate. However, I would choose to see it as a positive sign that many demonstrations took place and, in many – although not all – cases, the police acted entirely properly.</p>
      <p sl="de">In any case, it is not now a matter of arranging one of the umpteenth assessments of the elections; it is a matter of pointing out and emphasising the opportunity that now exists in Russia. I believe that is what matters. The purpose of this resolution is not to be yet another one condemning the elections, although we are obviously also expressing some strong words of criticism regarding a few things. What is important now is to call on all sides finally to adopt a reform package. It is the chance for Mr Medvedev to finally stand up, still in his role as President, and say: I have caused something to happen in this country! After all the hopes that were placed in me and that for years were not fulfilled, I have now shown that something is happening. It is a chance for Mr Putin to begin his new Presidency with a reform programme and to say: yes, I have been much criticised, but now I will demonstrate that I am also capable of taking Russia forward in terms of democracy and modernisation. It is also a chance for the opposition to show that not only can it oppose, but it can also exert an influence. That ought to be the message from this House. We want to join together to support the forces in Russia that want reforms and that want to say that Russia must take a new path into the new millennium that has already begun. Russia must carry out its reforms. It must become more democratic, because one thing has to be clear: modernisation without democracy cannot work, and therefore there needs to be more democracy in Russia along with more modernisation.</p>

I think they do not. However, I would like to ask the following question: do you not think that the resolution we are debating could be stronger, because if the representatives of the European External Action Service, who are diplomats, are speaking more forcefully on human rights issues than the European Parliament, does this not mean that we have not lived up to certain expectations?</p>

      <p sl="nl">I have been following your fine words closely, Mr Swoboda, but can we really speak of elections here? Elections? Now, those entail a whole process, surely? A process in which certain rules are followed, where all parties standing are recognised? You have, yourself, expressed a great deal of criticism. My final question to you therefore is: are you prepared to acknowledge these as elections? Are you prepared to acknowledge Mr Putin as President of the Russian Federation in the knowledge that these elections were actually not free, normal or fair? That is the essential question, surely?</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer to three questions. – Fellow Members, as we can see, there are very different assessments of this matter. I would just like to remind you that this is not about our circumstances and whether or not we recognise something. What is important here is that there is now a chance to further a reform process. If the opposition in Russia says that it now wants to implement reforms, should we then say ‘no, you cannot do that because this is a false system, as these were not proper elections’? Let us not try to be holier than the Pope, but let us try to help the opposition in Russia. Let us help the opposition to do something, and, Mr Migalski, of course we could criticise a great deal more. The question is, however: how can we help the two to come together? After all, the main thing that we are interested in if we want a partner in Russia is that we have a partner that is strong and democratic. That is my goal. It is not about the past; it is about the future, and that is also what the opposition wants.</p>
      <p sl="de">To Mr Stadler, who is new to this House, I would say: we are not talking about Austria today; we are talking about Russia. Perhaps you did not notice that. It is about Europe and Russia – that is the key issue – and next time, I would like us to be able to talk of genuinely free elections. These elections were still not free and fair, but let us help the opposition to find a solution with Mr Medvedev, so that Mr Putin will become a different President because he has different rules. We will not be able to change Mr Putin, but, with our support, the opposition can now change the rules according to which Mr Putin governs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today we are not speaking about Magnitsky or Khodorkovsky and other cases, but that does not mean that we have forgotten those cases; we will come back to those issues later.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are speaking today about the elections, or so-called elections; the presidential elections in Russia, and I must say that yesterday, the ALDE Group in this Parliament organised a very good, extensive hearing on the results of the presidential elections, We have Ms Garzinova and Mr Kasparov two opposition leaders visiting Strasbourg today; they are also on the balcony here now; they were actually telling their first-hand experience of these elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our group Chair, Mr Verhofstadt, also visited Moscow on 5 March right after the elections and he was on the streets. He saw that the military presence was so enormous and the people had not seen such a military presence since 1993. Speaking about these elections and the fraud which has been reported by the OSCE, ODIHR and also the Council of Europe, it is extraordinary: they are even increasing the results from the Soviet times when normally, the polling stations did not have more than 99.9% attendance. Now they were 100% in Chechnya.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that the results, the conclusions, are evidence that these elections were not free; these elections were not fair. This is now the question for the international question: what does it really mean? What kind of consequences should we draw from this? Is this President legitimate? Is the Duma, which was elected in the same manner in December, legitimate? How can they be partners with the European Union and the rest of the international community? That is the question.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the election observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) found that the Russian presidential elections were neither free nor fair. The local election observers were also able to verify that the official final result was not correct. Although Mr Putin’s campaign leaders claimed that this was the cleanest election that Russia has ever experienced, it leads, conversely, to the conclusion that things were not all above board in the previous elections. That goes for the fraudulent Duma elections, in particular.</p>
      <p sl="de">Under the restrictive conditions and one-sided advantages, we cannot exclude the fact that Vladimir Putin narrowly won the presidential elections. However, it was an election with no alternatives, a victory without opponents, as Mr Putin’s challengers were not on the ballot slip but on the street protesting against his policies. It was to be expected that, with all his resources and with all the power that he has over the state apparatus and the media, Mr Putin should decide the election in his favour in the first round. That is one way to win elections, but not the country’s confidence for the future. We need to take note of that, but we should hold back on our congratulations as far as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">The government of Russia has, unfortunately, missed the opportunity to overcome the existing division in society by holding fair elections. However, Russia needs these critical and creative citizens in order to develop. Their exclusion would only lead to further emigration and outflow of capital. Mr Putin has been in power for 12 years. His promise of stability means, in practice, stagnation. He will at best get the publicised military reform under way, entailing armament on a huge scale. The repeatedly promised economic and social modernisation is, to a large extent, yet to be realised. Rather, the most recent defamatory statements suggest that he remains trapped in his outdated world view, his KGB methods and the constraints of an autocratic system. That is why there are great expectations of the opposition. It must now attempt to ensure that the street protests do not become an empty ritual and just a roll-call count. Of course, political change in Russia must be desired and supported by civil society itself, but we, the EU, can assist this process by supporting, on the basis of a new electoral law, the unobstructed approval of parties and a fair and transparent election campaign, the challenge of the protest movement and its main demand for early Duma elections. That should speed up the structuring and setting of objectives called for by the opposition and, ultimately, demonstrate that there is an electable alternative to Vladimir Putin in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I have the impression that both our pragmatism and our importance in the world today demand that in this House, we say what those elections were really like. Perhaps the simplest solution would be not to adopt any resolution at all, if while we sit here, having been returned in democratic elections held across Europe, we cannot see the difference between elections which are democratic and elections which quite simply do not deserve to be called elections. So perhaps sometimes, we should simply not adopt a resolution, but if we do, we should put it in a single sentence: not everyone who wanted to stand in these elections was able to do so, and these elections have not contributed anything to democracy – they have nothing to do with democracy at all. Today, it is this kind of realism which we need, and not a realism in which we write things that are not true and in which we write these things over and over again and then become the object of ridicule. I say this because we, too, are losing the position we have enjoyed as the European Parliament, and the European Union is not being treated as a serious organisation. So today, I would like us to tell it like it is in Russia, since we have decided to draft this resolution, but if not, then sometimes in life it is better to say nothing.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, we have to speak to those who are on the streets and say to them that we understand the young generation and its protests. Russia is not any different from any other post-Soviet country. We must tell them very clearly that if force is used, we will take the same action as we have taken in every other case, and the use of force must today be a borderline which we set, here in this House. We have to be certain that on this issue, we are now definitely in agreement – both we, who sit on this side of the House, and those who sit on that side. I am in no doubt that this also includes Mr Swoboda, whom I know and respect. This should be said clearly here, today.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address my words expressly to Mr Swoboda. Your first motion for a resolution was pleasantly balanced and specifically unemotional with regard to what can be said following the presidential elections. In signing the European Convention on Human Rights, the Russian leadership made a voluntary commitment that it is not fulfilling. These elections, too, were once again not fair or free of fraud. Even a EUR 300 million investment in surveillance technology by the government did not solve a problem that can only be solved at a political level. These are the sober facts that do not leave us, as a partner, indifferent. They also highlight the contradictory nature of a Russian society, which, as everyone can see, is nevertheless changing. This is something we should welcome and support, because emerging democracies thrive on efforts to develop and change, and also on protests. Russia is becoming normal.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore consider a number of the conclusions drawn by some of my colleagues here in Parliament to be politically wrong. There must be no compromises in the text here, either. This House must finally decide what line it wants to take. At the ‘Russia after the Elections’ event yesterday, organised by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I discovered that some Members are of the opinion that Russia is no longer normal. Was it ever normal? They believe it represents a potential danger and that we cannot simply carry on as before, but must now finally take a different course.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would just like to say something about this. Those who want to think in terms of escalation spirals should now explain how far they want to go with this and, moreover, not only in terms of where that leaves our partnership. For all the justified criticism and all of the differences, partnership for me means, above all, a balance in terms of our common interests, and, at least in my mother tongue, partnership and subordination are not synonyms. People who advocate this path are also saying, as far as I can see, that they do not believe in the power of society to change and that they have not taken note of the changes in Russian society, to which, incidentally, the reports of the election observers from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) also refer, as here is where alternatives to the Putin-steered democracy are being sought. All of this must, ultimately, be discussed in political terms.</p>
      <p sl="de">The dynamism that some people are currently developing here in this House following the elections is something that I consider to be disconcerting, however. In my view, it cannot be reconciled with the political dignity and self-perception of a House that stands for plurality in Europe if representatives of part of the Russian opposition here in Strasbourg were able, unchallenged, to discredit the alternative presidential candidates by describing them simply as ‘Putin’s pigs’, when these candidates, without rectification of the election fraud, received the vote of more than 25 million citizens in Russia. Despite knowledge to the contrary, these same people have been speaking for weeks in this House, likewise unchallenged, of the possible bloodshed caused by Mr Putin and of potential revolutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">All I can say is that it is not the clear majority in this House that is deliberately taking the wrong course in its criticism of the elections in Russia.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, if we consider the efficacy of the institutional bodies established between the European Union and Russia, we will find that little progress has been made when it comes to any rapprochement between the two parties.</p>
      <p sl="el">Why is that? Does it not concern us? Perhaps both sides are making a mistake and we cannot be efficient when it comes to relations between Europe and Russia. If we really want cooperation with Russia, and I consider that we desperately need that cooperation, we need to carefully design a new approach. The accession of Russia to the World Trade Organisation is a big, new and very good step.</p>
      <p sl="el">So far, what the European Union and the European Parliament have been doing is to denounce everything that is happening in Russia. All we do is denounce. That attitude is not productive or creative. On the contrary, I believe that it is slowing down and hampering rapprochement between the two sides. We unilaterally consider Russian issues at a time when, first of all, we need multi-faceted cooperation in the trade, energy, culture and education sectors, before moving on to the human rights sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to relay a personal experience to you. Years ago, I met an Arab leader who is today one of the fallen Arab leaders. At that time, he had just returned from Moscow and he described how he and President Putin had agreed that ‘these Europeans want to tell us how to govern our countries’.</p>

However, the path of the former motherland of real socialism towards an open democracy is a long one, and Russia should not be measured by Western standards. I also believe, however, that Mr Putin’s new presidential term represents an opportunity now to take a new step towards further democratisation, that there is a chance to review the imprisonment of political prisoners, that the non-registration of opposition parties could be examined and that Mr Putin’s election promise to tackle corruption could become a reality. We ought to give Russia this chance. In general, I believe that we Europeans should not always wag our finger with democratic superiority. There are enough democratic deficiencies in the EU, too. Recall that only recently, the period of office of the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, was extended without any democratic legitimacy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Parliament has rightly expressed a lot of criticism about the way in which the Duma Elections were held. What really struck me is that one still knows nothing of what really went on in these presidential elections. Yes, on election day itself, everything may have proceeded in a relatively normal fashion, but the way in which the votes were counted the next day and, also, the candidates nominated, as well as the role of the media in the run-up to the elections, was simply unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I believe that Russia, a country that is also a member of the Council of Europe, ought not to permit itself to act in that kind of a fashion because it, too, has to keep to the rules.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, there are also some hopeful signs. I have never seen such peaceful opposition, such a peaceful gathering of ordinary civilians, turning out on the streets, protesting and showing that they can no longer take what happens in the Kremlin seriously. What we have to do today is ensure that we bring those people, those peaceful marchers, together with those in the Kremlin or in the Duma who are also willing to carry out reforms; we need to bring them together. That is the text of our resolution. And that is why we all ought to accept Mr Swoboda’s proposals.</p>

I am also convinced, however, that our Parliament, our groups, the parties behind these groups and the foundations could, and must, do more to help Russia as good friends and advisors.</p>
      <p sl="de">Since the Duma elections, there have been numerous demonstrations and the involvement of civil society has increased dramatically. It is not only politicians who have taken to the streets; there are also many citizens, consisting increasingly of middle class, well-educated people and people who have educated themselves further through travel. We need to step up our dialogue and increase our contact with these people and ensure that there is more people-to-people contact, including by dealing swiftly with the outstanding issues relating to visa-free travel.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we should step up our parliamentary dialogue now, too. I know that some people think less dialogue is the right response to the elections. I think that is wrong. We need more talks with our colleagues from the State Duma in order to discuss and to persuade and to offer them our experience. In so doing, we should present our views clearly so that our colleagues there can also learn from our experience and avoid the mistakes that we have made, and continue to make. We will best achieve this through clear dialogue and by showing as little as possible of the superior attitude that we sometimes see in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Partnership for Modernisation is a good instrument for this purpose.

I would like to say that what is happening in Russia today must give rise to fundamental doubts about the democratic character of that country. In this House today, no one is in any doubt that the elections in Russia were not true elections – and that the opposition in Russia is being persecuted – not just in terms of the procedure for counting votes itself, although practically every day brings to light new facts about how the counting of votes was not conducted fairly during the recent presidential elections, because democracy is, of course, something more than just the technical process of voting and of counting the votes – it is also all the circumstances: freedom of the media, freedom of political parties and freedom of speech. These things do not exist in Russia, and so even if a technically fair system of voting was guaranteed – going to the ballot box, casting your vote and the fact of counting that vote – even then we would not be able to speak of fair elections in Russia, because nothing else besides the technical act of voting is democratic in Russia. Today, the European Union should be taking a much stronger line because – and I want to say this very clearly – the Russian people deserve freedom, and this is what we wish them.</p>

If observers come to elections in London this May, they will find hundreds of thousands of non-existent ghosts voting by post without any kind of ID check. They will see flimsy cardboard ballot boxes with voting papers falling out of gaps at the bottom, mainly under the control of appointees of Baroness Ashton’s Labour Party.</p>

If someone believes that the United Kingdom does not have full democracy, but that Mr Putin is a model for democracy, then I simply have to say that the right has a way of looking at the world that I can no longer understand.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that the Duma elections were fraudulent and that we need to realise that in these Duma elections and in the presidential elections, candidates from the opposition who expressed criticism did not have any real opportunity to become candidates, because the way the elections were organised meant that they were not able to stand for election. At the same time, we are seeing a new middle class who are seeking to inform themselves and who want freedom, democracy and the rule of law in order, by such means, to develop a modern, economically sound, middle class-based state on the basis of the rule of law. I believe that we should support this. These people stand for the future of Russia in the interests of Russia. President Medvedev has now made an offer in a working group with the non-parliamentary opposition parties to make progress in terms of reforms. We intend to watch closely to see whether any steps forward are agreed on and implemented on the initiative of the next President. That is what this resolution is about. We want to see whether promises are kept here and whether words are transformed into action and the path to reform is taken. Allowing these reforms really would give President Putin the opportunity to achieve a fruitful Presidency. If this does not happen, Russia will develop into an authoritarian, dictatorial regime. For that reason, we would like to observe whether the opposition is treated fairly during the period leading up to the inauguration of President Putin.</p>

I believe it is important, first of all, that the conditions are created for the rule of law to be in place, for it to be easier for parties to register, for this registration not to be manipulated by the authorities so that signatures are not recognised, or for fewer signatures to be sufficient for registration. Freedom of the press is necessary in order for opposition parties to have a fair chance of holding their own in an election campaign.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are some of the conditions that are necessary for further democratic development to be possible in Russia, and I believe that these will then enable the relevant conclusions to be drawn.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I was in Russia to observe the Duma elections and, three months later, the Presidential elections. Despite the fact that during the Duma elections in one of Moscow’s districts, I bore witness to electoral fraud, this was also recorded on video by one of the members of the Central Election Commission, and as I returned from Russia, I was not overly depressed. My biggest impression was the huge public interest in the elections in Moscow and St Petersburg and the sincere desire of many people, particularly young people, to prevent any fraud. Undoubtedly, this was mostly demonstrated by those members and observers of the Central Election Commission who supported opposition parties and opposition Presidential candidates. It is therefore very regrettable that more parties and Presidential candidates were artificially prevented from participating in both elections, and that in the media, the government’s party and candidates enjoyed greenhouse conditions, while the opposition had to endure political draughts and cold.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, that desire to finally organise honourable and fair elections ran through not thousands, but hundreds of thousands and millions of Russian citizens, as demonstrated by the mass demonstrations in Moscow, St Petersburg and elsewhere. Surveys show that 10 years ago, Russia’s progress down the European road would have been supported by approximately 20% of the country’s population, whereas now such a route would be chosen by 30%, and more than half of Russia’s youth. This tendency allows us to take a more optimistic view of Russia’s future, but it should be remembered that around 40% would like a particular Russian road that may lead even further from democracy and human rights. I therefore very much support those colleagues who are in favour of intensifying dialogue with Russia at all levels and using all European Union opportunities so that we encourage Russia to take the European road.</p>

There were webcams in 15% of the polling stations, so that people could watch the elections themselves at home via the Internet.

      <p sl="en">The EU should continue to do what it is doing, only do it better. Our current approach, a strategic but critical engagement with Russia, remains sound and it is working. I agree with Mr Fleckenstein that what is happening in Russia today is a political awakening of the middle class. The ever louder demands for political reform in Russia are a direct consequence of its economic prosperity and openness to the world, but that prosperity and openness is, in a large part, due to the density and volume of the EU-Russia interactions: investments, trade, tourism and all that.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need more of that, including visa-free travel in the future. I am not saying that we should not be critical of the Russian Government whenever it disregards human rights or fails to uphold the principles of the rule of law and democracy but, in the end, constructive engagement will do more to advance our values in Russia than tough talk in rigid positions. Therefore, I would say that recent events in Russia and the presidential elections actually present a case for staying the course in terms of our policy.

      <p sl="bg">It is the duty of Europe’s leaders to prove this, first of all, to their own electorate, some of whom are recently starting to wonder both secretly and openly whether the era of division lines did not provide them with greater peace of mind. It is the duty of Europe’s leaders to prove this to the reformers of the Arab Spring who have embraced the ideas for change, having believed in the democratic ideals, and not on the basis of a geographical or historical affinity for Europe. They owe it also, now more than ever, to the thousands of democratically minded citizens in Russia who have come out in protest against the gross, large-scale human rights violations, the rigged elections and the acts of repression against the independent media. Their demands are mostly for uncompromising anti-corruption laws.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I firmly believe that what will turn Europe into an actual player in the democratic process in Russia is not the comfortable stance of a distant observer restricted to glib phrases and loads of non-binding recommendations. As Russia’s biggest trade partner, and especially as a major attraction for its assets, Europe has sufficient mechanisms available to guarantee both compliance with fundamental democratic rights and an effective battle against corruption, principles which it should place at the heart of its cooperation with Russia.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, numerous valid criticisms have been made but I would caution against our using a hectoring tone, because it is counter-productive. As the elections have shown, there is no de facto equal opportunity when it comes to the electoral law, the party law and access to the media. However, the fact is that the name of the President of the Russia Federation is Vladimir Putin, and the European Union needs to cooperate with him. Whether Putin’s reform of the political system or the economy succeeds is primarily in Russia’s interests, but also in the interest of the European Union. The Putin system has exhausted its own political reserves. More press freedom and more democracy are needed. However, an even bigger problem is that Russia has fallen behind the other BRIC countries in economic terms.</p>
      <p sl="hu">If the Russian economy is not modernised and developed, then tensions can arise that threaten social stability. It is in the interest of the European Union for Russia to be a stable and developing country.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for the elections to be truly fair, full access must be granted to all candidates, not just those who the authorities allow to take part. In the same way, the recent presidential elections are neither fair nor democratic. Nevertheless, a majority of the Russian people continue to support Vladimir Putin, now President, and before that, Prime Minister, and before that, President.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rulers in the Kremlin feel that support but they must realise that a lack of democracy breeds corruption and deprives the citizens of their dignity. Events in North Africa and the Middle East are showing that sooner or later, people will rebel against corruption and will come out on the streets to demand to be treated with respect. The same is true of Russia and the democratic reforms are essential in Russia if future turbulence is to be avoided. Turbulence is different from the recent peaceful demonstrations and I think this is one of the results of these elections.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Russia is very important to the European Union both as a neighbouring European country and as a global actor and permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. This is why we would like to have a closer relationship with Russia so that we can address issues of mutual interest and for reasons of global governance.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, there are obstacles to such a close relationship. We regret Russia’s behaviour during the Syrian crisis, and certain recent events, like December’s elections to the Duma, and the presidential elections on 4 March, have left us feeling disappointed and concerned. The elections did not conform to the democratic standards of a European country which is a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</p>
      <p sl="es">As I have said, it is in our interests to have a relationship of mutual trust with Russia, but the fundamental basis of this relationship should be shared democratic values, joint respect for human rights, the multi-party system and respect for the democratic opposition.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, an initial conclusion of the demonstrations and elections in Russia is that Russian civil society has become stronger and may be able to generate an alternative to the current regime. I think that pragmatism should prevail in the EU’s relations with the Kremlin administration, but this should not imply a waiver of our political and moral values. Russia should be aware that our position on the respect of human rights and democratic and transparent government is not negotiable.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Union should also make it clear to Moscow that its position on regimes such as the one in Syria is not in favour of peoples suffering because of totalitarian governments. I think it is important for the new administration to condemn what is happening in Syria, particularly within the United Nations. On the other hand, it would be desirable for the European Union and Member States to speak the same language when it comes to key dimensions of relations with the Russian Federation, such as energy policies.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, for very many of us who lived in the shadow of Russia in communist regimes, the outcome of these elections is no other than the election of Vladimir Putin as President. I would not want to delude ourselves and see things only from a certain perspective. For a very long time to come, Russia will find itself between Asian-style modernisation and European-style democracy. There is no doubt that those 30% of Russian citizens who are motivated to choose their European model are worth our investment. I emphasise that our partnership with Russia should focus on strengthening a civil society and an opposition which, hopefully, will no longer be divided.</p>
      <p sl="ro">About the elections: they were certainly neither free nor transparent, judging by our standards. Elections should not be assessed only in relation to the voting day, but against the whole general context. However, I think that if our partnership remains a privileged policy, we need to carry on with realism.</p>

We observed the so-called carousel voting on election day, vote fraud, and other irregularities and shortcomings reported by international observers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taking all this into account, as well as the announcement of potentially competitive candidates and TV broadcasting during the election campaign, which was 90% dominated by one candidate, we cannot draw any other conclusion than, firstly, that the presidential elections were neither free nor fair and, consequently, the legitimacy of the President-elect is questionable. Secondly, the Russian people are fighting for free elections and they deserve our support and solidarity.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, economically and politically, Russia is the most important neighbour of the European Union. The presidential elections in this country are an important decision by its citizens on the nature of the state, since crucial political power is concentrated in the hands of the democratically elected President of the country.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The elections, which were clearly won by Vladimir Putin, were accompanied by a number of objections by the opposition, whose leaders, however, received little public support. Doubts about the absolute fairness of the election process were also confirmed by independent observers from the OSCE. At the same time, however, they noted that none of the candidates standing against Vladimir Putin had a real chance of succeeding. I therefore think it appropriate to respect the fact that no significant political force is profiled in Russia today that would represent a real alternative to those currently in power for us or, in particular, the citizens of Russia.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In a healthy society, an open, political dialogue must take place in a free media environment, and that should be our main goal for Russia as well, so that the opposition, which is unsuccessful for the time being, will be able to show its true political potential in a new environment of freedom.</p>

In 2004, Belgium banned the Vlaams Blok, as though banning political parties was quite consistent with democracy. In Germany, in 2001, there were attempts to ban the MPD on the basis of evidence that was found by the Constitutional Court to have been fabricated by state agents. Was this in Communist East Germany? No, it was in the Federal Republic. In the UK, the BBC is a law unto itself. If you are an establishment stooge, you have unlimited access. If you are a genuine opponent of the establishment, you are talked about but rarely given access.</p>
      <p sl="en">At least the Internet is free, or so we thought.

      <p sl="fi">One requirement for democracy is that nations also inspect the dark side of their history. Germany, for example, has done this, and has developed its own term for it: Vergangenheitsbewältigung , or coming to terms with the past. In Russia, however, this has not been done. For example, when Russian youth are asked what their ideals are, a considerable number say that they idolise Stalin. In other words, if democracy is to develop in Russia, the people will need to look back at their murky history, and that will then result in a genuine appreciation of democracy and plurality.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank you for all of the analyses, comments and proposals. It has been exciting to listen to the debate, and I will make sure that some of your views are passed on to Baroness Ashton, so that she can be inspired by them.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to mention three points to conclude the debate. Firstly, I believe that everyone in the EU shares the disappointment over what has been referred to as the manipulations leading up to these elections, including in the form of a lack of approval of candidates, a lack of, and unequal, access to the media, and in relation to the instances of fraud that have been found, where the results of the elections themselves were manipulated. The EU has also expressed its criticism of this, and it is important that we continue to express this criticism in order to get Russia to hold considerably freer and fairer elections. Russia has undertaken – in relation to the Council of Europe as well as in relation to recommendations by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – to hold free and fair elections. I would like to emphasise that if we are to move Russia from where it is now to where we want it to be, it will be by continuing the dialogue. We need more dialogue, not less, in order to enable the Russians to move to where we want them to be with regard to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="da">At the same time – and this has also been discussed in the debate here today – we must appreciate the positive aspects of these elections. Firstly, President Medvedev promised to contact the Russian opposition. We believe that this represents an outstretched hand. We also have more international observers there than we have had before. It was previously extremely difficult to bring in observers – this time we succeeded. This also represents progress. Civic engagement in the elections in a number of areas indicates progress compared to previous elections. The large public demonstrations are probably, in reality, an expression of what we also know from other countries, namely, a vibrant democracy, where people also have the right and the opportunity to demonstrate.</p>
      <p sl="da">This is a new situation, and it is one that we must utilise. We must use it to exert pressure for the economic and political modernisation of Russian society. We must use it to gain contact with all parts of Russian society. We must ensure that we instigate and continue to maintain contact with Russia in a large number of areas. Thus, I believe that we will achieve the most by continuing a dialogue because, as some speakers also pointed out today, there are a number of international contexts in which it is absolutely crucial that Russia is involved. One speaker mentioned Syria, but I could also mention Iran. I could mention the whole immense discussion concerning the forthcoming Rio+20 conference. Therefore, we need to bring Russia even closer to steadily increasing democratic rule. We must continue in our efforts to bring this about.</p>

      <p sl="en">The large pro-democracy protests that we have witnessed during the past months in Moscow and other major cities prove that Russia is a changed country. Although Vladimir Putin was declared the ‘winner’ of elections, which were neither free nor fair, Russia’s young educated urban middle class is no longer willing to exchange economic prosperity for political freedom. They demand political reforms, rule of law and civil liberties. These people are Russia’s future. The European Parliament must support this Russian progressive movement by strongly condemning irregularities and violations in the preparation and conduct of the presidential elections and by demanding and closely observing implementation of political system reforms, announced by the outgoing President. Mr Putin’s authoritarian system took more than a decade to build and will not be dismantled overnight.

And I do not believe that Russian democrats Garry Kasparov and Mikhail Kasyanov, who are presently here in Strasbourg, would be proud and happy that the European Parliament has adopted a toothless text. In my opinion, the chair’s conference decision to permit this resolution to be conceived at this very moment was a mistake. We can, however, perhaps correct this mistake by referring to more independent analyses and by having a candid and dignified dialogue with Russia, and not by attempting to please the highest ranks of the regime in the name of business deals. One such egregious example is the French decision to sell Russia Mistral-class offensive weaponry, which will then proudly sail around near the coastal waters of EU Member States.

      <p sl="pt">The criticisms made in this motion for a resolution of the results of the presidential elections in Russia merely demonstrate, once again, that the EU has double standards. It is a fact that, when there were suspicions of electoral fraud in the presidential elections of 1996, neither the EU nor the US refrained from praising Russian democracy and the election of the candidate who suited them: Boris Yeltsin. The Russian Government has been demonstrating a certain economic and political independence, as well as defending its national resources, particularly in terms of energy, and advocating the role of the state in certain strategic sectors. More recently, Russia’s veto in the UN Security Council of military intervention in Syria meant that the US and the EU saw their expansionist aims blocked. The issue worrying the EU and the US, therefore, is not the defence of democracy, but their desire for Russia to have a government that better serves their interests. We would like the EU to pronounce on other issues too, such as the defence of strikers’ rights, and of social and labour rights, but this is an issue that appears to be of little concern to the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is again a pleasure to deal with the latest developments on EU activities in Kazakhstan on behalf of Vice-President/High Representative Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kazakhstan is a key player in the wider region of Central Asia and an influential actor in international forums. It has recently held the chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Since its independence 20 years ago, it has been the European Union’s policy to support Kazakhstan’s economic and political progress. The EU has a strategic interest to further deepen our involvement with Kazakhstan and to fully develop mutual political cooperation potentials, especially considering the rapidly evolving regional integration dynamics.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kazakhstan is a pragmatic partner, open to reform and willing to explore opportunities. The EU is also an important trade and investment partner for Kazakhstan. The recent start of negotiations on a new Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Kazakhstan was a sign of the importance that the EU attaches to its cooperation with Kazakhstan. However, strengthening EU-Kazakhstan relations does not – and cannot – occur independently from the progress of political reforms in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The respect for common values of democracy, the rule of law and human rights are the basis for deepening our relations. This is a statement we jointly made with Kazakhstan in 2009, and we stand by it. Therefore, we maintain our position that the success of negotiations on the new agreement will be influenced by the advancement of political reforms and fulfilment of Kazakhstan’s international commitments.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, we are concerned about the recent developments and the overall slow progress of political reform in Kazakhstan, including the limited implementation of international commitments. According to independent observers from the OSCE, both the early presidential and early parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2012 fell short of meeting democratic principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the first time since Kazakhstan’s independence, we have seen considerable social tension, including a number of terrorist attacks. The strike of oil workers that started in May 2011 culminated in violent clashes with the police in December 2011, resulting in 17 dead and about 110 injured. To cope with evolving security challenges and threats, the Kazakh Government has amended a number of laws over the past few months. It has introduced changes that seem to empower the state more and more, while restricting the rights and freedoms of citizens, civil society and political opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Vice-President/High Representative received several questions from honourable Members of the Parliament about these developments and about the EU’s approach, opinions and actions taken. She and her service are actively following the situation in Kazakhstan. Over the past 11 months, there have been more than 10 statements issued by Catherine Ashton herself, and by the EU, at the OSCE Permanent Council. On 17 December 2011, immediately after the violent clashes, the High Representative’s spokesperson published a statement expressing concerns, calling for immediate investigation of the events and a peaceful solution to the situation of the striking oil workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European External Action Service and the EU Delegation in Astana have maintained regular contacts with the authorities, calling on Kazakhstan to uphold its international obligations and commitments, in particular, regarding freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly. The Prosecutor General’s Office in Kazakhstan is carrying out an investigation, and the EU has requested that this process be thorough, transparent and not used to target any specific group or intimidate the Kazakh opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 2 February, the Vice-President/High Representative met with the Kazakh Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Kazykhanov, where she expressed her concerns and raised specifically the issue of the arrest of a number of opposition activists, including Mr Kozlov, leader of the Alga opposition movement and Mr Vinyavski, an independent journalist. As a follow-up, on 9 February, the EU Delegation in Astana carried out a démarche, asking for information on the health of Mr Kozlov and access to him for his wife and lawyer. As a result, the EU Delegation visited Mr Kozlov in a military hospital in Almaty where he had undergone surgery. The EU Delegation was able to confirm that he had not been ill-treated and that his surgery was due to a previously existing health issue, which was not an urgent matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s efforts and communication with the authorities, notably, the cases discussed in the regular human rights dialogue with Kazakhstan, also yielded results. The jailed human rights activist, Mr Zhovtis, was granted amnesty and released in February 2012. The trade union lawyer, Natalya Sokolova, who was sentenced to six years due to her role in the strikes, was also released, on 7 March, and her sentence was replaced by a three-year conditional sentence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has several times expressed its readiness to provide support to Kazakhstan for reforms and for the investigation of the events in December, as well as to address the underlying socio-economic problems that led to tensions in the country to begin with.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is funding several projects that are already tackling issues that contribute directly to the improvement of the social, economic and political situation. These include projects on regional development, public service reform and modernisation, support for judicial and legal reform, for local governance and for civil society development, as well as several projects relating to democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Promoting and supporting reforms in these areas, and further establishing relevant actors, are priorities both for civil society and the Kazakhstani authorities, at both central and regional levels.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also expect that the perspective and negotiation process of the new Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will provide a stimulus for Kazakhstan to make more progress, notably in enhancing freedom of expression and freedom of association and encouraging real political pluralism.</p>
      <p sl="en">To motivate progress, we foresee including fundamental political and economic reform commitments in the new agreement, including aligning regulations to EU norms and standards, and essential political clauses on human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">Kazakhstan’s commitments to these fundamental principles will be a strong and clear expression of its will to step up political and economic reforms. WTO accession would also be a clear expression that the country is taking economic transition seriously and is ready to commit to multilateral rules and would show that Kazakhstan is willing to bring increased legal certainty to our relations. This is in the interest not only of Kazakhstan, but also of the EU and the wider international community.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is, by no means, a simple process. We are only at the beginning of these important negotiations. However, we are determined to ensure that the European Union continues to stand alongside the Republic of Kazakhstan and its citizens, both as a friend and a partner, on the path of political reform and economic development. In this endeavour, we count on the support of the European Parliament and we look forward to the resolution that you will adopt tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Søvndal for his thorough description. First of all, I, too, would like to express our total support to the families of the victims of the serious clashes that took place on 16 December in Zhanaozen, and our concern for the subsequent unfolding of events. What was initially essentially a labour dispute degenerated into extremely serious incidents in which 17 people lost their lives and, in the days following the incident, led to the arrest of journalists and representatives of the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is in everyone’s interest, as Kazakhstan has done, to shed full light on the events and I therefore hope that today will be remembered solely as an opportunity for our Parliament to explore what has happened thus far, and to reiterate our call for an investigation that will reassure the international community that the responsibilities for the events of Zhanaozen will be clarified and those responsible pursued in the utmost respect of the principles of the law and respect for human rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">The delegation that I have the honour of heading has had the opportunity of hearing the explanations provided by the Kazakh authorities at some of its meetings, as well as those of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that are very active in monitoring events in the country. The willingness of the authorities of Kazakhstan to provide explanations and the promise to provide further clarifications are undoubtedly positive elements and should be appreciated by us all.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is another reason why I would like to underline the need to maintain a certain balance, which I would have liked to have seen play a bigger part also in the text of the resolution on which we will have to vote tomorrow, and which, in my opinion, it would perhaps have been better to have postponed until the official investigations were over. It would also have been useful to send an official mission of international bodies to flank the investigations. The undeniable need to further clarify what happened and to call for greater efforts on the part of Kazakhstan in improving its progress along the road to democracy must also be accompanied at all times by a new commitment to an open and constructive dialogue with the country.</p>

I agree with you that just now, Kazakhstan is very open and we must use this situation and use the leverage and power of the European Parliament to put pressure on Kazakhstan to enhance the human rights situation in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, since last year, we have witnessed not only an increase in civil protest and peaceful resistance, but also a decline in fundamental and human rights. This decline is the key word. It is not going better but it is in decline. We are concerned to see an increase in harassments, intimidation and detention of opposition leaders, of independent media persons and other civil actors. In a joint resolution, which I hope will be accepted tomorrow, we urge the Kazakh authorities to reverse the negative trend in human and fundamental rights and to understand that economic cooperation must go hand in hand with political cooperation and the improvement of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are both very important – economic cooperation and human rights. That is why it is important for the Kazakh authorities to understand that we expect Kazakhstan to show some positive actions during the PCA negotiation. Therefore, a truly positive action Kazakhstan could take immediately is to fully implement its adopted national human rights action plan. In fact, Kazakhstan could be one of the happiest countries in Central Asia. Economically, it has become a wealthy country but socially and politically, however, it still has to live up to its international commitments and to allow democratic involvement and participation of the citizens in social, political and labour issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we Europeans wish for Kazakhstan to become a true forerunner for such a ‘spring’ in central Asia and we need to use our leverage in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, first of all, I would like to welcome the realistic manner in which the declaration made on behalf of Baroness Ashton addresses the situation in Kazakhstan. I also believe that not only Kazakhstan, but the whole of Central Asia, should represent a strategic partnership for the European Union, because we cannot speak only about human rights, but also about social rights, and this should be of particular concern to us.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to welcome the start of negotiations for this partnership and cooperation agreement, because I never had the cynicism to simply criticise, and instead I understood, as a politician, the need to get involved in order to change things. In my opinion, this seems to be the way to follow in an active foreign policy action of the European Union. Under this agreement, the issues related to human rights must be a priority. However, we cannot fail to sanction the major deviations from democracy we are facing in Kazakhstan. I also welcome the release of Natalya Sokolova, but I request, in particular, the release of the opposition leader, Mr Kozlov, and of the leader of one of the most notable media authorities, the editor-in-chief, Igor Vinyavski. They are not the only leaders who are facing unjust and unfair trials at present, under a law aimed at national security in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think the main signal that Kazakhstan’s leaders want to democratise their country and ensure a future destined for its citizens lies in the way they address fundamental rights and freedoms. It is vital to re-examine that national security law because it is the source of these oppressions and this should not be tolerated. We cannot consider freedom of speech a violation of a law that concerns national security. No concept of national security in the world can violate the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is true that Kazakhstan is the most open country in Central Asia, economically speaking. European investments are welcome there and companies such as Total, Eni, Areva and Alstom have operations there with major interests. It is also true that Europe is hoping to use this country as a route to transport its troops and military equipment out of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In view of its interests, Europe is remaining discreet and pragmatic towards the Kazakh authorities. However, are we not being too pragmatic at the risk of repeating the same mistakes we made with the Arab world? Moreover, that is what civil society in Kazakhstan, and in the former Soviet Union in general, is convinced that we are doing. We must therefore be attentive to what is actually happening in Kazakhstan. By freeing Ms Sokolova, the lawyer for the trade unionists, and Mr Zhovtis, the human rights defender, the Kazakh authorities are showing proof of goodwill. However, growing and continuing repression of the political opposition, the trade unionists and the independent media persists. Forty-three strikers in Zhanaozen are being threatened with long prison sentences, as are nine members of the opposition, Mr Kozlov, Mr Viniavski and Ms Amirova.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have seen unbelievable censorship of the electronic media to silence all alternative sources of information. Following the orders of the presidential Security Council, 125 websites, judged to be dangerous, have already been blocked, with 168 others on a blacklist.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A series of recently promulgated laws tracks this regression in the human rights situation in Kazakhstan: laws on audio-visual material, the Internet and information and a law on religious communities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Although the Kazakh authorities are telling us that they learned their lesson from the tragedy in Zhanaozen, they have just promulgated a law on national security which severely limits freedom of expression and the freedom to change the labour code, which restricts the rights of workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Are we going to, once again, content ourselves with verbal promises from the Kazakh authorities and continue with business as usual or are we going to openly say to our Kazakh partners that the repression of dissident voices cannot ensure long-term stability? The European Union will, in any case, have to commit to daily monitoring of the upcoming trials of the various strikers and opponents and ensure that the legislative reforms guarantee fundamental freedoms.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Kazakhstan is the European Union’s most important partner in Central Asia, although geographically, some areas in the west of the country are, in fact, part of Europe. Kazakhstan plays an important stabilising role in this strategic region of the world, and the Kazakh authorities attach great importance to relations with the European Union. We know that recently in Kazakhstan, violent events have taken place in which people have been killed. We would like to offer our condolences to the victims’ families, and are of the opinion that explaining the circumstances of this tragedy is in the interests of all concerned and, in particular, of the Kazakh authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We think, however, that we should be careful in our judgment of these events, since we do not know all the facts about what took place. The European Parliament’s resolution must not turn into an indictment, particularly when it is not supported by evidence. I think we should appeal to the authorities in Kazakhstan to provide a full explanation of these tragic events, to punish those who are found to be guilty and to exonerate those who are innocent, but in this situation, we must not charge the Kazakh authorities and we must not take over their role.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, what we see in Kazakhstan today is severe and large-scale regression in the field of human rights and democratic rights. However, this regression – seen, for example, in the brutal crackdown in Zhanaozen, which saw at least 17 people killed – did not prevent the German Government from signing a lucrative trade deal for rare earths this February. Here we have an example of fine words about human rights not matched by actions, particularly when it comes to vested economic interests.</p>
      <p sl="en">So let us have some action here and ask the Vice-President/High Representative’s representative to give a clear commitment that the negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will be suspended until there is meaningful change and until all political prisoners, including Vladimir Kozlov and human rights defender, Vadim Kuramshin, have been unconditionally released, and all trumped-up charges and investigations against the 43 strikers and their supporters awaiting trial – and the leaders of the political opposition – have been dropped, including those against Ainur Kurmanov, leader of the Socialist movement in Kazakhstan, and the leader of the independent trade union ‘Zhanartu’, Esenbek Ukteshbaev. It is those who gave the order to shoot down peaceful protestors who should be in the dock, not these opposition activists.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome Natalya Sokolova’s release from prison, but all charges against her must be dropped and there must be no restrictions on her trade union activity. The Kazakh Government is suggesting that they have learnt lessons, but actions speak much louder than words, and their actions suggest that the crackdown on workers’ rights and democratic rights is continuing and going even further. For example, February’s amendments to the labour code allow the dismissal of workers involved in strike action, makes it easier to dismiss trade union representatives during strike negotiations, and legalises lock-outs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report of the general prosecutor’s office has insufficiently accounted for the role of the state forces in the events in Zhanaozen, and the number of people who died according to that report is massively disputed by eyewitnesses. An independent, international inquiry is still desperately needed. If I am granted a visa, I will be travelling to Zhanaozen as part of a delegation of trade unionists, human rights activists and journalists to try and help bring out the truth.</p>

      <p sl="nl">En passant , the Kazakh authorities are flagrantly violating the fundamental right of religious freedom. Under the guise of a new, forcibly introduced act on religion, they have, since the autumn of 2011, been taking pride in forcibly dissolving as many as 570 of what they term religious organisations. That is hardly something to boast about.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Christian communities are under surveillance by the police and secret services and are also having to contend with anti-cult centres, set up by the government, whose job it is to mobilise public opinion against religion. Searches of the houses of defenceless Christian citizens, confiscation of their property, all without any legal grounds.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is the murky backdrop to the compulsory re-registration of religious groups. Harassment of house churches, including huge fines for their leaders, completes the factors raising the spectre of religious persecution in Kazakhstan. That is the reality, Council and Commission.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the claims by the Kazakh Government that hooligans and foreign agitators were behind the violent incidents in connection with the demonstrations by oil workers remind us of similar statements by Syria. The government and the authorities there are never to blame.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was probably on account of international pressure and the fear of country-wide strikes that Kazakhstan changed the sentence imposed on the lawyer who gave legal advice to the striking oil workers from a prison sentence to a suspended sentence. In this regard, we should not forget that the arrest itself should never have happened in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important to remember the activists and oil workers who are still awaiting trial. The fact that police officers, who, according to video footage, killed fleeing striking workers by shooting them in the back, can probably expect only mild punishments is also worthy of criticism. A full investigation of the incidents will probably only be possible by an independent international commission of inquiry. The only right and proper step can be to put an end to the violence against activists and to return to an open dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU’s interest in Central Asia has been growing for some time. Kazakhstan is our most important partner in the region, from both a political and an economic point of view. Since the start of the negotiations on an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which I very much welcome, and following the regrettable events in the Zhanaozen district and in connection with the parliamentary elections, we have now focused particular attention on Kazakhstan. I expressly support a close and open dialogue with Kazakhstan in order to enhance our relations. It is crucial that we pay tribute to Kazakhstan’s positive development in the areas of democratisation, human rights and the rule of law, even if, from our Western point of view, these only represent small steps and we rightly expect more progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very pleased to see the willingness of the Kazakh authorities to deal with the events in Zhanaozen. In a mutual exchange, including with non-governmental organisations and representatives of Kazakh civil society, we were able to build up a comprehensive picture. The constructive dialogue between governmental and non-governmental representatives around a table in this way with us parliamentarians in Parliament was groundbreaking. The resolution should support this positive development. From this point of view, I think a postponement would also have been sensible, in order to wait and see what the investigations bring to light and so that we would then have clearer conditions for our position, which we do not really have at the moment. That is the position of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), and I stand by that, too.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I have to admit I am concerned by this tendency of nevertheless trying to replace real action with fine, polite and correct words when responding to a fundamental problem, and in Kazakhstan, we are facing a very serious problem. The problem is the direction it took following the elections in May 2011 when Nursultan Nazarbayev became President again. For a long time, Kazakhstan had been very different to other countries in Central Asia: it was more tolerant and more secular than other countries in the region and ahead of them in terms of both its economic progress and its openness. Sadly, what we have witnessed lately are attacks on freedom of opinion and thought, politically motivated courts, many political prisoners, and the brutal shooting of demonstrating workers in the town of Zhanaozen.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I am therefore convinced that we cannot renege on such things as democracy, human rights and the very fact that these are non-negotiable just because here we are talking about an important and rich country with economic potential. I therefore want to add that the thing that shocked me was that, for instance, Vladimir Kozlov, the leader of the People’s Party was arrested as soon as he returned from Strasbourg, after the plenary session during which he met me and my other colleagues. It seems to me that until these people are released, until they are no longer considered incommunicado , as they are currently, then there can be no talk of the government becoming more aware of what is going on or of some concessions that we would make. Either the political prisoners and dissidents are released or we have to issue a very severe warning and respond even more harshly.</p>

Mr Kozlov, as well as other political opponents of the government, was sentenced and put in prison.</p>
      <p sl="en">More recently, I have also met with some Kazakh civil society activists, including Mrs Kozlov, and I was extremely concerned to hear that Mr Kozlov has recently undergone surgery while in prison but that his current state of health is not known. Nobody, including his wife, is allowed any contact with him. Journalists I have also met have been intimidated and threatened with arrest if they write anything against the regime in Kazakhstan.</p>

If the people we know in Kazakhstan – our friends – are in prison, if force is being used, we cannot treat this situation as if it were normal. It seems to me, however, that Kazakhstan today needs to be given a chance, not just by the European Union, but in this case together with the United States. I have the impression that the Kazakh Government is still ready to accept such a proposal, but for this to happen, we need to speak in unison. The borderline we have set – where there are arrests and where force is used – is one we cannot cross. However, we can make an offer, the price of which is freedom for the media and preparations for free elections, elections which will one day take place in Kazakhstan, just as they do in any other country.</p>

The development of democracy is a long-term affair, requiring first of all the establishment of the rule of law as a foundation. The Kazakh leadership is striving for this, and on the basis of my discussions with Kazakh citizens, I can say that they value the fact that Kazakhstan is an oasis of stability and secular values in Central Asia. That is the first point. Secondly, I can say that even though this is undoubtedly a state where rather authoritative forms of governance prevail, Kazakhs nonetheless value their President, and this can be seen from the fact that they have now got a per capita GDP level of USD 9 000, compared to USD 400 in 1991 when Kazakhstan started out as an independent state.

We also have assurances about transparent, objective trials for those who have been arrested, among whom we are most concerned about Mr Kozlov, Mr Vinyavskiy and Ms Amirova. This is very important.

Not less worrying is the fact that, right after the parliamentary elections in January won by the ruling Nur Otan party with 80% of the votes, opposition leaders and journalists were detained. It seems that every effort was made to silence critical voices.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am encouraged that some limited steps have already been taken in response to criticism: for example, the release of Natalya Sokolova last week, and of other activists who should not have been detained and convicted in the first place.</p>
      <p sl="en">I recognise the important role of Kazakhstan as a partner of the EU in Central Asia, and for this reason, I insist that the country should show more progress in reforming its political system and respecting human rights and media freedom.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the readiness of the authorities to continue the dialogue with the EU on these issues, but we also have to be very clear. We expect much more from a country which made strong commitments before it took the chairmanship of the OSCE, did not implement many of those commitments during its term, and forgot about them afterwards.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Kazakhstan is a main partner of the European Union in the region of Central Asia. In June 2011, negotiations started with it on a new Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The country obviously has a long way to go until it achieves European standards of political pluralism, freedom of speech and assembly. However, Kazakhstan is still making efforts to gain recognition as a secular, constitutional and modern state.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is a long-term process which the European Union must support. This is why I call on the Commission to develop a more strategic approach to human rights dialogue in Kazakhstan, to provide more active support to civil society representatives in the region, and to establish a properly functioning mechanism for coordinating the European Union’s efforts as part of a structured dialogue on human rights and a bilateral dialogue between Member States and the republics of Central Asia, thereby also avoiding the political disagreements within the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, as they say in a well-known film: ‘nobody’s perfect’; and we in the European Union do, of course, face dilemmas and problems with countries where things happen which we should criticise, and which we do criticise, things which conflict with certain of the values and principles we adhere to in the Western world – in the European Union or the United States – and this, of course, applies today to Kazakhstan, too. Kazakhstan is a country with which, on the one hand, we want to cooperate – many of the EU’s Member States want to cooperate with Kazakhstan and buy its natural resources. Kazakhstan is declaring an openness to working with the EU’s Member States and the Western world, and the President – who holds a great deal of power in Kazakhstan – is promising political changes. On the other hand, we see that things are not moving as quickly as we would like, things are moving with difficulty, and there are examples and situations which we see as fairly clear violations of human rights. So I think that in this situation today, we ought to say to the President of Kazakhstan and the Kazakh authorities that we are still open to working together but, at the same time, we are going to be very scrupulously monitoring cases which we consider to be violations of human rights, and we must tell the President of Kazakhstan that there can be no consent to persecution of the opposition, and that we do not agree to the repression of journalists and the silencing of free media.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the tragedy in Zhanaozen last 16 December raises concerns not only because of the number killed and injured by the violent repression, but also because of the difficulty in obtaining clear information about what really happened. The investigation initiated by President Nazarbayev will only be credible if it includes an international component to evaluate the facts independently and impartially, taking statements from all those involved, including demonstrators, relatives of the victims, reporters, police and civil society. The investigation must examine the responsibilities of the authorities, including the alleged torture of arrested demonstrators.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The confrontations in Zhanaozen arose from the growing wave of government oppression of the independent press, opposition political parties and civil society. The European Union has to remind the Kazakhstan authorities that the new cooperation agreement cannot progress without credible political reforms that make the democratic rule of law a reality in that country, regardless of the strategic importance of the economic and military interests at stake. The reforms must include the freeing of human rights campaigners and political prisoners, such as Vladimir Kozlov, who was detained after a visit to the European Parliament and whose wife is, at this moment, the target of threats and intimidation for attempting to defend the rights of her husband. He has to be freed as soon as possible and, at the very least, has to be allowed visits by his wife and the lawyers he has selected. The state of his health is a concern.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European External Action Service must continue to monitor this and other cases, linking the negotiations on the future cooperation agreement to the freeing of political prisoners and effective progress with regard to press freedom, employment rights and other basic human rights such as the right to an independent judiciary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Pomyśl, zanim pomyślisz! – ‘consider before you form an opinion’ – that is what the Polish aphorist, Stanisław Jerzy Lec, demands, and it would also do us good to heed this recommendation sometimes here in Parliament. Only a few weeks after the resolution on a strategy for Central Asia was adopted here in this House, which sought to censure the states of Central Asia, we are now responding to events in connection with strikes in Zhanaozen in Kazakhstan without waiting for the outcome of the ongoing investigations that are being carried out with international involvement.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regrettable as the deaths are and as much as those who were injured and imprisoned during the course of these events have the right to a review of what happened, the reasons behind these events remain unclear. Thus, Vladimir Kozlov, leader of the unregistered opposition party, Alga, stated that ‘it was a different group of people; the unrest was by no means in the interests of those who were striking, as it merely provided a reason for violence to be used against them’. The Central Asia expert, Arkady Dubnov, also said: ‘It cannot be ruled out that elements of the Kazakh opposition who live abroad will also get involved. On the other hand, maintaining the tensions could be very much in the interest of someone in the Kazakh capital, Astana. After all, Kazakhstan’s power elite are already fighting for the chance to become President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s successor’.</p>
      <p sl="de">We had the opportunity here in Parliament to speak with the Kazakh opposition in the presence of the Kazakh ambassador. The UN Special Representative stated today that he is impressed by the attention that the Kazakh Government is giving to the events in Zhanaozen and that it is necessary to uncover the true facts behind the unrest. We ought to take the Kazakh authorities at their word and measure them by their actions, but we should not make premature, reflex judgments.</p>

We expect the authorities to conclude the ongoing investigation in an accurate and transparent manner. Transparency means including independent experts as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The democratisation of Kazakhstan is certainly a slow process. This is only the beginning for Kazakhstan, on the way to further democratisation and approximation with European values and standards, and equally in the field of human rights and the development of democratic standards. The country needs to invest considerable efforts and political will in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that Kazakhstan will justify the expectations of its European partners, will heed the criticisms levelled today, and will try to take the necessary action. It has recently been invited to join the Venice Commission and is about to receive the status of ‘Partner for Democracy’ in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The citizens of Kazakhstan deserve better human rights standards, the rule of law and a democratic future – in other words, a much better future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to see today’s discussion in Parliament as an expression of concern for the future of Kazakhstan and as an expression of concern for the future of mutual relations between Kazakhstan and the European Union, because we know the role which Kazakhstan plays in this region of the world – in particular, the stabilising role during the conflict with Kyrgyzstan – and we also know the effects of its leadership of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is also a country of great economic opportunities, a partner in economic exchange with Europe. The recent huge contracts concerning the search for natural deposits in Kazakhstan should be mentioned here.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the other hand, however, we also know it is a country whose recent elections have attracted criticism from the OSCE, which Kazakhstan was leading at the time, and here we are also concerned by the lack of full democracy and, in particular, the failure to respect the rights of the opposition, human rights and the rights of journalists. For many years, the opposition party Alga has not been able to achieve registration – why not? The party’s leader visited the European Parliament, and when he returned, he was arrested. He has undergone an operation, and his wife is being denied contact with him. On the other hand, we also have reports of journalists who have been arrested. There is, in fact, a whole list of these activists – both public activists and opposition journalists – who are at this moment in prison. This is the basic standard we expect – freedom for opposition activists, and freedom for journalists – and when these things are achieved, they could then be a basis for a constructive dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the events of 16 December in Kazakhstan have greatly shocked many people, me included. My thoughts go out, first of all, to the families and friends of the victims. There is no excuse whatsoever for a government to allow a strike or protest to end in such a bloodbath.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What exactly happened on that day remains unclear, but what is important is that we find out the full truth. When the President of Kazakhstan said that he would launch a full inquiry, including the involvement of international experts, I thought: there is hope. However, to my regret, I must conclude that there has been no such international contribution whatsoever. I would therefore repeat the call that Parliament made in February for an international, independent investigation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, when it comes to human rights in Kazakhstan, there is also a general negative trend. Other members have already spoken about this. For us Europeans, it is of the utmost importance that Kazakhstan develops into a stable democracy, a thriving partner in Central Asia. I therefore find it essential that, when negotiating a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, we draw attention to democracy, human rights and an independent and impartial judiciary.

What is important for us is to have a dialogue between the Kazakh authorities and civil society, to allow the workers, the employees, to have independent trade unions because, through this dialogue, through this cooperation, we can create stability which would profit the workers, the companies and society. In this way, society can develop, and develop in the direction of more human and civic rights and the rule of law, which is so important both for us and, I am also convinced, for the Kazakhs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Union and Kazakhstan can develop a true partnership based on political and economic cooperation for the benefit of both parties. The high frequency of meetings held last year and the start of negotiations for a new partnership and cooperation agreement prove this. However, for these relations to develop further, it is necessary that the Kazakh authorities honour their commitments in the area of democratic reforms and fundamental human rights. Several measures are essential in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Firstly, the irregularities reported by OSCE/ODIHR on the occasion of elections in January must be investigated. At the same time, further efforts are needed to ensure the rights of the opposition and the freedom of the media. In this context, I wish to welcome the recent release of Natalya Sokolova and to express my hope that it will be followed by other similar gestures. Last but not least, the violent events resulting in the loss of human lives, which took place in Zhanaozen in December 2011, must be elucidated. However, authorities have stated their decision to conduct a transparent and thorough investigation into these facts, within an investigation committee. We must encourage them to make all the necessary efforts in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Søvndal, Commissioner, opinions have been expressed in this debate concerning the need for a realistic policy towards Kazakhstan. I agree with this objective, although realism must not be allowed to mean acceptance for what was, unfortunately, a flagrant violation of human rights. Nowhere, and this includes Kazakhstan. At this point, I would like to welcome the decision of the Kazakh authorities which allowed Mr Kozlov to undergo an operation, and also for allowing him to be visited by his family and the EU Delegation. I also appreciate the fact that the draconian sentence handed down to Ms Sokolova has been changed. It is to be welcomed not only that she has been released from prison, but also that she has been allowed to continue her work as a lawyer. However, there are still too many other people being held in custody and awaiting trial. We insist that the authorities keep their word that these trials will be fair and just.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to come back to the question of a realistic policy again. Of course, we are aware that high standards of democracy are not achieved in a very short space of time; they are not achieved in a flash. However, to ensure that this process moves forward in Kazakhstan at a reasonable pace, the authorities there have to know that future EU-Kazakh relations, including economic relations and the benefits the Kazakhs expect to receive from the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, also depend on how quickly improvements are introduced in the field of human rights and political reforms in Kazakhstan.</p>

      <p sl="it">Those who have followed events in Kazakhstan in the last few years have had the opportunity to appreciate the steps taken to improve social dialogue, workers’ rights, the independence of the judiciary and the development of democracy. We were therefore struck by the deaths in December and would like to express our sincere condolences to the victims and our hope that the facts will be established, the true facts. We are talking about a country where there are still a lot of open wounds left by the Soviet Union, and we are aware of the difficulties the government of Kazakhstan faces in governing such a vast area midway between the two worlds of Europe and Asia.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is still a long way to go, but we believe that in this Parliament, there are some specific groups that intentionally ignore what is happening in our partner countries, such as China and India, where international law and the respect for market rules come second to their economic and electoral priorities, while we focus our criticisms on countries that are trying to make progress in developing democracy. Their progress may be slower than we would wish, but it must be helped and not hindered.</p>

However, we should also consider where this country is coming from. Circumstances are not continuing to improve for the people in all of the countries in the region. Not all of them have freedom of religion or respect for minorities, for example. However, Kazakhstan has nevertheless achieved this, and that is also something we should remember.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must not simply measure Kazakhstan by European standards, and we must take into account the situation in the region as a whole. Obviously, human rights violations must not simply be ignored, that goes without saying. However, I think this situation is not just black and white; there are also shades of grey, and we have experienced a good level of cooperation with the Kazakh authorities, the ambassador and the public prosecutor in recent weeks, including in the Central Asia Delegation.</p>

The fact that the European Union is following political developments in the country is because Kazakhstan is an important state in the Central Asian region with considerable development potential, which is open to economic and political cooperation with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The events of December 2011 should, however, encourage us to monitor the political developments in the country more closely, so that we can better formulate our views in the talks on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that is under preparation. The requirement of stronger commitments by Kazakhstan, adherence to human rights and religious and political freedoms, as well as structural and economic reforms, should therefore be an important part of negotiations on the new agreement with the European Union, and where there are problems in adhering to these commitments, we should be consistent in drawing the attention of our Kazakh friends to those problems.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, thank you for the debate, which I think was both helpful and useful, and which will also help us refine our policy. I would like to reiterate that Kazakhstan is an important partner for the EU for very many reasons. However, it is clear that we also have misgivings with regard to current developments and the slow progress of the political reforms.</p>
      <p sl="da">I also believe it is necessary to emphasise that President Nazarbayev is well aware of what we stand for. It is precisely because he knows what we stand for that he has chosen to cooperate with us. This, in particular, gives us the opportunity to mention our concerns as well as how we can contribute to helping Kazakhstan develop in the way that we would like it to. We will obviously make it clear what we expect of Kazakhstan as a condition for the conclusion of a new trade agreement. It is very important for us to take this opportunity, in particular, to emphasise our clear expectations. This means that we are, of course, willing to cooperate with Kazakhstan in these matters. It means that the negotiations are an important tool for us, both to strengthen relations and to emphasise the need, and provide an incentive, for reforms, both economic and political, as well as reforms in the area of human rights in the broadest sense.</p>
      <p sl="da">I will now answer the question of what role we see Kazakhstan playing in the region. It is clear that Kazakhstan can play a very important role in the whole of Central Asia. It did so in 2010 in connection with Kyrgyzstan and the unrest there. Thus, we consider Kazakhstan to be a country that will help to stabilise the situation in the region. We believe it is possible to establish even better regional cooperation in Central Asia, and that, in this context, Kazakhstan will play a very significant role, which is something to which we also want to contribute.</p>
      <p sl="da">I will take away with me what I have heard in this debate. We must use our presence to develop democratic standards and an even stronger strategic partnership. We must also utilise the negotiations because it is these negotiations that will give us the opportunity to initiate a debate, including concerning the values that the EU stands for and that Kazakhstan is obviously familiar with, and that the country wishes to work with us to achieve. We also have an EU delegation in Astana that is providing practical assistance in all of these areas.</p>

In view of the geopolitical situation of Kazakhstan, a country which has had a difficult past, but which is trying to introduce precisely these principles, we should continue to stress the seriousness of the situation in Zhanaozen, but should also remember that Kazakhstan is the country with the most dynamically developing European standards in Central Asia. I would like to point out that Kazakhstan is, for us, a strategic partner, and that it is making every effort to develop our bilateral relations. Kazakhstan’s successful chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has shown that it is able to rise to formidable challenges.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, thank you again for giving me the opportunity to speak on Nigeria on behalf of the High Representative. It is a pleasure to be here today to discuss this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nigeria is at a crucial juncture. President Jonathan’s reform policy can shape Nigeria’s future. Its democracy is consolidating and its economy is growing rapidly. Nigeria has the potential to become the biggest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa within a few years. It plays a major role on the African continent, it was a member of the Security Council last year and is a member of the Human Rights Commission this year. Former President Obasanjo recently led the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) – African Union mission in Dakar to monitor the elections and this sent a strong message in support of democracy and people’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the honourable Members for their interest in Nigeria for recent months. I say this with particular conviction because I had the pleasure of representing High Representative/Vice-President Ashton at the recent Ministerial meeting with Nigeria in Abuja on 8 February. It was a remarkable occasion and a very positive one.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nigeria still faces crucial challenges: The European Union strongly condemns the recent attacks carried out by Boko Haram, with appalling loss of human lives. The Christmas bombings of churches and the recent suicide attack on a church in Jos on 26 February and again on 11 March are deeply shocking. So are all of the other attacks, including that in Kano some weeks ago. They should all be condemned.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, the number of attacks and human losses are increasing every day in an unacceptable spiral of violence. High Representative Ashton has repeatedly expressed her solidarity and sympathy with the victims, the injured and their families.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wish to make use of this opportunity to express our profound sadness at the loss of life of two European hostages in Nigeria on 8 March. We condemn in the strongest possible terms criminal actions such as the taking of hostages. Our heartfelt condolences go to their families for the irreplaceable loss they have faced. May they find strength in this difficult time.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU stands alongside the Nigerian authorities in their fight against terrorism, to protect all citizens, in particular, the most vulnerable, and to preserve the right to life and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The root causes of Boko Haram are many, but it is no coincidence that it is strongest in the north of the country, which has some of the worst socio-economic indicators in Africa. Nigeria’s North-East Region is one of the world’s forgotten emergencies: the grievances there need to be addressed urgently, and we as partners and friends have promised the government to help them do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Boko Haram is targeting the secular democratic state, and Muslims and Christians. Nigeria remains a secular state with religious freedom firmly enshrined in its constitution. However, Boko Haram is trying to exploit the ethno-religious differences, which will always exist in a country as big and diverse as Nigeria. Nigeria’s complex problems certainly have religious dimensions, but they cannot simply be blamed on religion. We have a well-established regular local human rights dialogue with Nigeria, during which all important issues, including freedom of religion or belief, are raised. The most recent such dialogue meeting took place in February this year. The EU is committed to supporting the government and people of Nigeria in ensuring religion is not misused to legitimise politically or criminally motivated violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to add that the EU has been very active on the issue of freedom of religion or belief, especially during the last two years, as many countries – not only Nigeria – have experienced a surge of acts of religious hatred and violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have used our full range of instruments, either bilaterally or in multilateral fora, in New York and Geneva, to be at the forefront of the fight against religious intolerance. We will continue to do so. EU delegations have been requested to follow closely the situation of their host countries and report on issues and actions taken. As required by the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers in February 2011, the overall action of the EU in this respect should be reviewed by the Foreign Affairs Council in the coming months.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, fortunately, some positive signs of Nigerians taking initiatives to ease the situation, such as the Association of Muslim Students, who exposed on Facebook the fallacies of Boko Haram. Important leaders of Islam in Nigeria have rejected Boko Haram as misguided and murderous fanatics. Nigeria’s Catholic bishops have highlighted that the Boko Haram crisis has also brought the best out of many Nigerians such as Muslims and Christians protecting each other. The government is also making progress in developing and implementing a comprehensive counter-terrorism strategy, and several prominent Boko Haram members have been arrested. During my meetings with the Nigerian Government in February, I encouraged them to explore this counter-terrorism strategy further.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nigeria matters to the wider world. It plays a big stabilising role in the region. It is the fourth largest oil exporter in the world and the second most important exporter of natural gas to the EU. Nigeria is firmly committed to the UN, is a major provider of UN peacekeepers and is vocal and robust in its support for democracies and freedom. Nigeria’s positions in the recent Ivorian and Libyan crises speak for themselves. In short, I found a strong and open African partner, which, in many ways, shares our views and our values.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Ministerial meeting resulted in several openings, which we should now explore further. One is the agreement on establishing a local dialogue on peace, security and stability, and other openings are Nigeria’s interest in climate change and Rio+20.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was interesting to hear from Nigeria’s leaders how they see their economic development. They are diversifying to reduce their dependence on oil and gas, investing in infrastructure and agriculture, and focusing on job creation for their young and growing population of 160 million people. I heard many times that Nigeria strongly encourages European investment and participation in its strong growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, Nigeria faces serious challenges, not least widespread poverty. Better governance, maintaining ethnic harmony and fighting corruption and crime are some of the big tasks it faces. Although Nigeria’s human rights record has improved steadily in recent years, there are still areas where further improvement could be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">The security situation in the Niger Delta, although improving, remains fragile. The region is vital for the national economy because of its oil production, so ensuring its peaceful development is essential. The EU is currently implementing a EUR 200 million programme to assist the development of the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bricks, stones and words can be used to separate people, but they can also build bridges. Therefore, honourable Members, I call upon you to use your contacts with Nigerians to support and facilitate this absolutely essential bridge-building with Nigeria and I look forward to the resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Mr Søvndal, for your substantial and in-depth statement describing the situation in Nigeria, which contains some very meaningful comments. I would also like to publicly remind the Chamber about Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, who are not just two European citizens; they are two men, two people who loved that country very much and sacrificed their lives there. They should be considered on a par with all the Nigerian citizens who have lost their lives in recent months, the victims of a particularly fierce strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">This strategy is using God’s name to implement its plans to achieve power, crippling the efforts of the government, the people, the institutions and the civil society of Nigeria to make this country a leader within the African continent. Therefore, Mr Søvndal, I say that the real problem of Nigeria is not ethnic or religious tension, but the fact that behind the ethnic and religious tension, there are interests and power strategies to achieve these interests, which have had such a negative impact in the last few months.</p>
      <p sl="it">Despite this, we must be concerned, because having a clear view does not mean that we are in a position to avoid the risk of a civil war. This strategy is gaining the upper hand in many areas of the country: the strategy of the fundamentalist groups. While it is true that they are using religion in a distorted manner in order to achieve energy resource control, for example, at the same time, they are encountering a very weak response from the government which is coming across as particularly indecisive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I ask you to be particularly concerned with implementing the actions you have proposed, in which you will have the support of the whole Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is true, Minister, that is it difficult for Nigeria to imagine such a contrast, a very explosive cocktail of tensions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the one hand, the population is living in poverty –which is still extreme – particularly in the north, while, on the other hand, there is an immense wealth of oil resources being exploited by companies that are polluting Nigerian waters without hesitation. There are also religious conflicts between the Islamic North and the Christian South, the presence of Boko Haram and therefore hard-line terrorism, which has led to the tragic deaths of two hostages. There is still political corruption. There are social troubles against the backdrop of poverty, but you have spoken, it is true, of the democracy that is beginning to emerge, of Nigerians taking charge of their own destiny.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In spite of everything, violence is still part of their daily lives. The paradox of all this is that we can clearly see the role that Nigeria plays – and you have described it well – at international level and at African level, particularly in Western Africa. It contributes, as you said, to promoting the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), whose headquarters are in Abuja. It has increased conflict resolution initiatives. In recent years, it has led mediation meetings in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe. It is involved in many UN peacekeeping operations in Africa. It has even recently deployed an entirely female police force in Liberia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of this Nigeria that we are talking about today in the resolution, with its clear and sombre face, we wanted nonetheless to condense the very specific requests that you have asked us to relay. We are asking them to demand that oil companies operate with transparency and respect for the environment and that they clean up the damage caused to the environment. Amnesty International has written entire reports on this issue. We have called for a law criminalising homosexuality to be abolished, then, and I say this with force – it is one of my group’s priorities – for the imprisoned trade unionists to be released, and finally, for both a fairer distribution of wealth and religious tolerance to be guaranteed, since intolerance is still a breeding ground for terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, last year, I was an election observer in Nigeria. The hope and anticipation among Nigerians was remarkable. They welcomed observers; anything that could ensure their vote would count and be counted transparently.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the night before the first round, an explosion close to Abuja killed 25 people preparing for the elections – most of them youngsters, serving their year in the National Youth Service Corps, sons and daughters of Nigeria. Violent extremism kills indiscriminately and, combined with poverty, corruption and related problems, it does not take much imagination to picture how the extremists would achieve their goal to destabilise the country, to pit people of different religions against each other, and to recruit those without perspective.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nigeria is home to one fifth of Africans. It is a leading nation in West Africa, for better or worse. Half of the population – 75 million people – are under 18 years of age. They will demand the opportunities they deserve. Many of the youngsters know more about the world than their parents did, through media and new media, including the fact that not everyone is poor and that it is not necessary to be poor in such a rich country. The young generation filmed the vote count of the elections on their cell phones and they will hold the authorities accountable. I would not be surprised at a Nigerian Spring one day.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must invest in this young generation and do what we can to give them education and opportunities. An important prevention for being recruited by extremist networks is such independence economically. Nigeria is rich – I emphasise it again – in resources and in human capital. The EU stands ready to help to ensure more equal benefit from wealth and more equal distribution and good governance and to prevent and end the terrorism in a sustainable way.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Nigeria is a country with more than 150 million people and it is the largest oil producer in Africa. When things do not go well for Nigeria, then the whole region becomes unstable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And things are not going that well for Nigeria at the moment. Although the country could be earning good money from its oil, more than half the population is living in poverty. What lies at the root of this is large-scale corruption. The oil dollars are disappearing into the pockets of a lucky few. The gap between rich and poor is increasing, and Nigeria is just one example of the many countries in Africa whose wealth of raw materials ought to be a blessing and, yet, it has become a curse.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Poverty makes people vulnerable to extremist ideas. Religious groups step into the gap left by the government. You can blame your poverty on someone else, someone adhering to the wrong faith. Another variation of that is blaming your poverty on the fact that you are not following the doctrine of your religion strictly enough. ‘Join us in strictly adhering to doctrine’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Communities in Nigeria are going after each other’s blood in the name of their God. We might as well call this by its proper name. It is therefore best that we look for the real causes of poverty and see whether anything can be done about them. One of its causes is corruption. In any case, in the short term, the EU can do something to combat the corruption there by applying its Transparency Directive to oil and to mining, because if we publicly declare how much European companies are paying the Nigerian Government, then the Nigerians will also be made aware of that and then the money will not be disappearing into really deep, dark pockets.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore disappointed to see that Shell, the Netherlands’ largest oil company and a major player in the Niger Delta, is putting pressure on the Dutch Government to try to kill off the Transparency Directive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I ask my fellow Members and the European Commission not to allow this to happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I last spoke on Nigeria in 2010 after the Jos massacres. Recent events, following repeated atrocities and kidnappings by the jihadi group Boko Haram, remind us that Nigeria sadly is a chronically unstable country.</p>
      <p sl="en">By rights, Nigeria, as the most populated and oil-rich country in Sub-Saharan Africa, should be vying for a permanent seat with South Africa on the UN Security Council, but instead there are now concerns about a civil war between the Muslim-majority north and Christian-majority south, to which are added ethnic, cultural and economic tensions in Nigeria. The central government struggles against these factors and in fighting the still very widespread corruption in public life.</p>
      <p sl="en">The added element of a secessionist insurgency from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta makes the security situation particularly precarious in this country. The introduction of Sharia law in 12 states, in contradiction of the secular, federal constitution, also causes widespread fear amongst Christians in the north and there are increasing concerns about the long-term sustainability of Nigeria as a unitary state.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent brave attempts on 8 March by the British Special Boat Service to free the kidnapped Italian engineer, Franco Lamolinara, and British national, Christopher McManus, ended in the tragic death of both individuals and I extend on behalf of my group my deepest sympathies to the families of the deceased. Boko Haram and all those responsible should be held accountable for the murder of these two EU citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Goodluck Jonathan struggles to bring order and security to his country and is committed to fighting corruption and ending massive economic subsidies, such as to fuel, in order to restore free market economics to Nigeria’s large economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in the EU should give every support to his government. Any further escalation of violence will have massive repercussions in West Africa and result in large flows of refugees to Europe, particularly to my country, the United Kingdom.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen, the persecutions and killings of Christians are continuing on a wide scale in Nigeria. The latest official data says that the Boko Haram armed group, which wants to convert the country to Islam, has killed 1 200 Christians in the last two years and forced 35 000 Christians to flee the country. However, in some Arab countries, too, like Egypt and Iraq, millions of Christians are discriminated against, even killed or forced into exile.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is a sort of growing religious racism against Christians that is being accepted almost with resignation or fatalism. In this situation, the international institutions, including Europe, and important political and religious figures must make their voices heard loud and strong and call upon governments to face their responsibilities. I should add that I would also like to see the so-called moderate Islamic citizens, who quite rightly reject extremism, join us in defending the rights of their Christian fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="it">To return to Nigeria, we have mentioned the widespread poverty, the high levels of poverty of so many millions of people in this extraordinarily rich country that could so easily provide amply for all its citizens. As Ms Sargentini says, there is a problem and that is corruption, which is so widespread and pervasive that it has altered the social structures of the country. With corruption, there is no respect for the environment, no free market, no opportunities for trade or young people, and therefore, ultimately, there is no democracy either.</p>
      <p sl="it">In actual fact, Nigeria needs a proper, qualified, extremely honest ruling class, and without this, it cannot really be considered a modern country or a democratic country.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Søvndal, ladies and gentlemen, it may well be that there are some specific examples of terrorism and violence in Nigeria. It has also long been known that Sharia is present in 12 states. For years, thousands of people have been dying in Nigeria. We are all aware of that, and for years nothing has been done about it. Overall, however, it is clear – and in this regard I would like to follow on from what Mr Provera was saying – that in many Muslim countries, which are allegedly experiencing a new Spring, there is substantial persecution of Christians. Whether it is in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria or Sudan, it is striking that more and more Christians are coming under pressure there, and we have no answer to this. Therefore, the European Union must have the courage to attempt to develop and justify a new offensive and defensive strategy and to allow this to influence policy. It is not enough simply to adopt this statement tomorrow. It may well be right – it is not wrong, and therefore I can support it – but it is not enough. Anything can be written on paper. The situation of the Christians in the countries listed is, unfortunately, not so easily dealt with, and the people there urgently need our help. Therefore – and this has nothing to do with religious conflicts – Europe must support these Christians, also in respect of the freedom of conscience and belief, and consider new strategies and new developments for ways in which it can better help these people and exert more pressure on the governments to actually assist these people.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, thank you for the debate. I think it has been a very interesting one. As I said, I have formed new impressions as a result of my visit to Nigeria, and I would like to communicate these further in relation to some of the things that have been said. After that, I will hand over the floor to the Commissioner, who will take over from there.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would like to start by saying that there are some who have an interest in turning this into a religious conflict – a dramatic religious clash. That is what Boko Haram wants – namely, for this to become a huge religious conflict. I believe that we need to be very careful not to fall into its trap in a country where members of different religions sit together in the same government, a country where people marry people of different religions, where people of different religions live side by side, and a country that, of all places, is capable of avoiding a major religious clash. I believe that we should be very careful about playing the religious game. Having said that, this is actually a fight for the right of all religions to be practised, protected and taken care of. I believe that, in this debate, we must remember that the first to be killed if Boko Haram gets a hold will be the Muslim groups who are carrying out attacks up in the northern part of the country.</p>
      <p sl="da">I also agree with those who deeply regretted the attacks by the same organisation on 8 March. We expressed our sincere condolences to the families of the victims. We condemn these acts as exactly what they are: criminal acts. It is a criminal act to kill other people, irrespective of what argument you use to justify it. I believe it is important to repeat that there is no argument on earth that gives people the right to take the lives of other people for the sake of a political issue. Therefore, those who do this must be brought to justice. They must be sentenced and put in prison. They must not be elevated to the status of martyrs for what they have done. Killing other people is purely and simply a crime.</p>
      <p sl="da">I hope that some of you will have the chance to visit Nigeria’s political leaders, both its President and a number of its ministers. I also hope that you will return with the same impression that I had, namely, that it is very rare to see an African country that has political leaders of such high moral strength and great competence. That is also what we need, because they are facing huge challenges in relation to the fact that this is a country with a very young population and a high level of illiteracy, a country that is, to a large degree, bound to oil as its only source of income, a country that has problems with terrorism up in the north and one that also has the prospect of doubling its population over the next 40 years. That is rather a tall order for a government if it also has the task of governing a poor country. That is precisely why it is so good that it has a government with such high moral standards as it has right now.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is worth noting that even in this situation, with these odds, Nigeria is able to play its part as a stabilising factor in relation to the areas of West Africa, which, incidentally, have experienced very high economic growth in recent years. I also agree with all those who said that it is crucial for a country like Nigeria, which is not a poor country, to ensure a better distribution of wealth in order to benefit the many and to combat corruption. That is what they are trying to do, but the people leading the fight against corruption do not stay very long in the job – as it is a relatively dangerous job! With these comments, I wish you well for the continuation of the debate. We need the European Parliament to keep an eye on what is happening in this country, which may perhaps end up being the world’s third largest country in terms of population size over the course of the next 40 years.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, there has recently been an unbelievable increase in the number of attacks carried out by the radical Islamist group, Boko Haram. Hundreds of people have been killed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Boko Haram is using religion to destabilise Nigeria. The socio-economic inequality there, the poverty, the high levels of unemployment, the corruption and the lack of prospects, especially for young people, are providing fertile ground for extremism. I believe – as other members have already said – that we, as the European Union, should not only strongly condemn the violence, but also do everything in our power to support Nigeria. The most important thing in this regard is that we, as the international community, also find out the underlying causes as to why people in Nigeria, a country so rich in resources, are not actually able to become rich themselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That means that we also have to do everything to encourage cooperation in the region. We, as the EU, should contribute to that process. I understand that the Dutch Foreign Minister last week asked that Boko Haram be added to the list of terrorist organisations. I wonder whether that has actually happened, and if not, when it is going to happen.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I must start my speech by condemning the violence that has been taking place in Nigeria over the last few months. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the one that has the best prospects for economic growth and for attracting foreign investment. Its position as an oil-exporting nation allows it to acquire substantial resources, which should be used in the vital task of fighting the poverty and inequality that blight the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner, as we in the Committee on Development have maintained on many occasions, human rights, democracy and development have a synergistic relationship of mutual reinforcement. At the root of the conflict in which Nigeria is embroiled lies the absolute poverty in which a large proportion of the population lives. The nation’s wealth is not being redistributed amongst the lowest levels of the population, and this is making millions of Nigerians vulnerable, with no access to the most basic services.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union, by way of its cooperation and development policies, can make a real difference in this country. We must focus our common strategy on the fight against poverty through the provision of basic services, such as health and education, for the most vulnerable. The value added by the European Union in this country should, without doubt, be to achieve a reduction in inequality and to turn the growth that the country is experiencing into increasingly fewer people living in extreme poverty.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should be wary, however, because we now know better than ever before that our cooperation policy will not be enough. We have to strive for consistency in the European Union’s other policies vis-à-vis Nigeria. I also want to stress the importance of transparency and responsibility amongst European companies operating in the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to conclude, Commissioner, by mentioning a very serious risk that threatens Nigeria and the whole region of West Africa and the Sahel. The very prolonged drought, poor harvests, lack of livestock, and the rise, once again, in the price of food are now hinting that a famine in the region is imminent. United Nations agencies and civil society organisations are already declaring famine. We must react in time and deal with this famine before it claims more victims in this region.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, at the risk of being unoriginal, allow me to say that the violence and, indeed, the barbarianism that is unfortunately commonplace in Nigeria, have found a very fertile breeding ground for their development there. Nigeria is still incapable of fulfilling its sovereign functions, including, in particular, the protection of its citizens. Its authority is regularly undermined by factions acting either in the name of Islamic fundamentalism or violence against religious and ethnic minorities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, we must also remember that Nigeria is not a state that is lacking in resources. These resources, particularly in terms of oil, do little, if anything, to alleviate the needs of the population. The measures approved by the Commission to remedy the instability in the Niger Delta, to work towards improving governance, to provide support for anti-corruption measures and so on, are, of course, relevant and useful, but responsibility lies, first and foremost, with the Nigerian authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I very much welcome the opportunity, at long last, to have a debate on Nigeria. It is a major country, as we have heard, which is extremely important in the region and potentially internationally. I very much regret that the only way we seem to be able to discuss events in Nigeria is via yet another resolution which has taken religion as its focus.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to respond to some of what has been said today. Let us be clear here that, while Boko Haram is the major force behind the violence, they are not killing only Christians. Muslims have died too. They have also assassinated Muslims who do not agree with them. However, there have also been Muslim deaths where Christians – or so-called Christians – have retaliated. We have also seen these events being condemned by political and faith leaders from a variety of different perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important to remember what has been said about what links this country, and not just what divides it. Yes, corruption is an issue. There is more that we could be doing. I, for one, very much welcome the recent trial in British courts of Ibori, a former governor of Delta State, which put him in jail. There is more that our own countries can do to deal with corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">The people of Nigeria want a government that is fit for purpose. That is why, as we have heard, they were willing to stand for hours in the sun waiting to vote. However, I believe that the European Union, too, needs to change its relationship with Nigeria and that this Parliament should be strengthening its relationships with the Nigerian Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Islamist terrorist organisation, Boko Haram, has an iron hold over Northern Nigeria. This is a depressing situation, one in which Christians would rather take their own steps to protect their churches and religious communities than rely on the police or the army. This is what I heard from a local observer this very morning.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The unbridled violence of Boko Haram and its Islamist followers is causing a huge amount of tension within the large Christian minority in Northern Nigeria. For Biblical reasons, the older generation wants to restrain young people from taking reprisals against their fellow Muslim citizens, many of whom have also become victims of Boko Haram, and, more than anything else, wants to exercise conciliationism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is a powerful spiritual struggle which deserves impartial government support. That brings me to the core problem which has been mentioned in the resolution, too. To what extent has Boko Haram infiltrated the Nigerian state apparatus?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have two questions on this that I would like to put to the High Representative or her substitute. I will give them to the Commissioner now and I hope I will be able to put them to Baroness Ashton next week when she visits the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. What views does Baroness Ashton or the Council have on this? To what extent has high-level infiltration taken place in Nigeria?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My second question, which is based on reports, is: to what extent is Boko Haram operating closer to Europe: for example, in large Nigerian communities in the United Kingdom? The answers to these questions could be extremely important for many things, including deciding what position Europe should take.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, coming from Northern Ireland, I know only too well the fear and the pain the Nigerian people are suffering as the result of the wanton violence of terrorist groups who kill others because of their religion. The broad Christian population of Nigeria is living in fear. Suicide bombers have targeted places of worship. In late February, in the city of Jos, three people died as a bomb was driven into a church in but one of the latest attacks.</p>
      <p sl="en">The terrorists gave this chilling warning: we attacked simply because it is a church, and we can decide to attack any church. We have just started. It seems that the militant Islamists of Boko Haram desire to rid Nigeria of its Christian population. Of course, I accept the point made by others in this House that others apart from Christians have suffered and died, and I want to make it clear that I condemn all these attacks.</p>
      <p sl="en">Losing your life because of your religion is not acceptable. We in this House should call it for what it is. It is not simply all about poverty or corruption, but it is about attacking a particular section of society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, ladies and gentlemen, in 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning mass atrocities in the region of Jos, where, at the time, a large number of Christians had been massacred. Today, unfortunately, we have to say that the situation in Nigeria has deteriorated. While it is true that freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Nigerian constitution, the authorities in Nigeria are too weak to fight organised crime, which does not accept the idea of freedom.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The organisation Boko Haram, which is terrorising the Christian community and is fighting for the introduction of Sharia law in all of Nigeria’s states, is resorting to bombings, in which over 1 000 people have now died. A week ago, two hostages died at the hands of the same group: a British and an Italian citizen, who had been held captive for 10 months.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Two years ago, the European Parliament was in doubt as to whether the main motivation for the outrages in Nigeria was religion. The experts were of the opinion that the roots of the violence in Nigeria were very complicated: economic, social, ethnic, political. However, today it seems obvious that the basic cause of the violence is religious hatred. The name ‘Boko Haram’ can be translated as ‘western education is sinful’, and a command to fight sin and immorality is, by its very nature, a religious command. The conclusion is that we must support those in Nigeria who are trying to oppose the religious fanatics.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, we are all concerned about the reports coming out of Nigeria: the attacks of 20 January in Kano, in which more than 150 people were killed, the kidnappings, the failed rescue operations and the tragic events of last weekend, in which a suicide attack on a church with at least three fatalities led to an act of revenge claiming the lives of ten people.</p>
      <p sl="nl">These explosive tensions between different communities demonstrate the powerlessness of the Nigerian Government. If stability is to be created, there will have to be dialogue between the religious groups and between the regions, but, above all, the rule of law must function so that these crimes do not go unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Nigeria’s vast resources ought to have brought the country huge wealth, but the opposite has been the case. The oil appears to have brought nothing but problems, such as environmental pollution and the kidnapping of foreigners, and the profits have all been siphoned off to richer countries. But we, the European Union and its citizens, can play an important role in the stabilisation of Nigeria. If the profits from oil extraction did not all go to large international companies, like Shell, then the local population would also be able to benefit from this lucrative source of income. And if these large international companies were to duly pay their tax, then the government could become stronger.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For that reason, we urgently need the Transparency Directive to come into being, as my fellow Member, Judith Sargentini, just said. Fairly distributed wealth is a guarantee of stability. In the new plans for the Union’s external policy, principles, such as democracy and rule of law, peace and security, occupy an important place. How the European Union, and the High Representative in particular, assists Nigeria with the current developments will make it clear, in practice, how much store we set by these principles.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the many misadventures of Nigeria include the deaths of Franco Lamolinara and Chris McManus, two European citizens who were killed during the failed attempt to free them. This was a very sad episode not only because of their deaths, but also because of the way the operation was coordinated between the countries involved, and for the apparent absence of any European involvement dear Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="it">Italy has complained about the lack of information about what was about to happen – and this is already one issue – but I must say to the Commissioner that the citizens of Europe need a visible face of our shared foreign policy that is able to face its responsibilities on behalf of Member States, especially where there is little coordination, as was the case in Nigeria.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, many people are licking their wounds, the Italians who were unable to be part of the liberation plan, the British for a failed operation and Europe for having kept a low profile. We condemn terrorism, which is also a phenomenon totally alien to African culture, and call on Nigeria to do its utmost, but we must also learn what the EU’s responsibilities are, and quickly, if we want to be taken seriously by Europe’s citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the cruel violence of the organisation Boko Haram has already been mentioned by several fellow Members. It is appalling and, with its brutality, it is repeatedly gaining the attention of the world’s media. I would like to recall in this regard that there have also been extreme acts of violence in Nigeria in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">In July 2009, more than 700 people were killed, and in January 2010, in the state of Plateau, more than 300 people were killed and more than 10 000 displaced in connection with religious and ethnically motivated violence. In both cases, the government set up a commission of inquiry, which carried out an investigation and drew up a report. However, these investigation reports were not published and those responsible were not named in either 2009 or 2010, nor prior to that in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are serious failures, and therefore I would like to emphasise the call in our resolution for there to be independent investigations of these human rights violations, and for the perpetrators to then be given a fair trial, and this should include the perpetrators on all sides of the conflict. That is what I would like to call for.</p>

Islamist extremists are attacking Christians and murdering them only because the Christians belong to a different religion and have a different culture, tradition and values. It is horrific that tragedies of this kind are taking place on such a large scale in today’s world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In fact, the first clashes between Muslims and Christians were noted as long ago as 1990 and, at the time, the international community unfortunately was not very consistent in its attitude. The effects of this passivity were in evidence last Sunday, for example, when Boko Haram terrorists placed bombs outside a church in Jos, murdering another 14 innocent people.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, the European Parliament must issue an unequivocal condemnation of Islamist terrorism and the attacks on Christians. Members should enlist the help of experts to draft a plan for extending support to the authorities in Nigeria in the fight to stop the bloodshed and reunite the country.

I would urge the High Representative to put in place now arrangements to ensure that they know that they will be called to account.</p>
      <p sl="en">This group has been waging an insurgency against Nigeria’s Government since 2009 and has been blamed for hundreds of killings and gun and bomb attacks. In the past six months, they have widened their targets beyond the police and other authority figures to include Christian worshippers. They have bombed churches in the cities of Jos and killed 185 people as we have heard.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any society, this is totally unacceptable. But I also want to raise the fact that Nigeria is the world’s eighth largest oil producer and yet the majority of its 145 million inhabitants live below the poverty line.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe this is something that the High Commission should be raising not just with the Nigerian Government but also with the producers and the developers of these oil products.

I believe that we need to become more aware of this region, where terrorist groups coordinated by al-Qaeda are operating.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A more serious concern for Nigeria as a whole is also required. In Africa's most populated country, 80% of its 170 million inhabitants are struggling in misery and poverty, although the country itself is not poor. Nigeria is the ninth largest oil exporter in the world but, at the same time, it is one of the most corrupt and poorly positioned countries in the UN human development index classification. Therefore, I think that we need to go beyond the minimal stage of monitoring elections in African countries, otherwise, poor governance, poverty and corruption will continue to fuel instability and violence.</p>

Extreme poverty, endemic corruption and poor governance have created a breeding ground for extremist groups that enables them to easily recruit young unemployed Nigerians.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Nigerian Government must take effective measures without delay in order to protect its citizens and put an end to widespread corruption and impunity, and the European Union must help the government in its efforts.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, for several months now, the news coming from Nigeria has been worrying. The actions of the terrorist group Boko Haram have become more and more violent. Thus, in November 2011, 65 people died in a series of bombings in Damaturu; on Christmas day, 44 people were killed in the attack committed in front of Sainte-Thérèse church of Abuja. The Friday evening bombings in Kano, in the north of the country, which led to the death of at least 185 people, are so far one of the most barbaric acts claimed by Boko Haram.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, it is known that Nigeria has been for decades the scene of clashes between Christians and Muslims. However, the aggravation of the security situation is now manifest and I think it can no longer be ignored. The actions of the Boko Haram group are threatening the stability of the whole country and many are wondering whether, at the moment, Nigeria is about to disappear. Therefore, our support is more than ever necessary to establish a climate of tolerance and respect for the freedom of religion in Nigeria.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to conclude by drawing attention to paragraph 7 of our common resolution: Boko Haram is threatening not only Nigeria, but the entire region, because of potential connections with AQMI.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the religious and ethnic violence in Nigeria has claimed thousands of victims over the past 10 years. Since 2009, we have been seeing a marked escalation in connection with the activity of the extreme Islamist sect which has been mentioned here many times. Since July 2009, it has been behind 160 bomb attacks against Christians in which over 900 people have been killed, including 44 last Christmas. The group aims to introduce Sharia law in all of Nigeria’s 36 states. It has launched a religious war against Christians and is threatening to drive them out of the north of the country, which makes Christians a very heavily persecuted religious group. In the Middle East, there is already the risk that Christian communities will disappear, and this may translate into a wave of migration to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The situation in Nigeria is one of political instability and corruption, factors which have led to an extremely uneven distribution of wealth. Nigeria has the second highest GDP in Africa and is an important supplier of crude oil to Europe, but a huge proportion of its population are trapped in poverty and have barely USD 2 a day on which to live. This provides the basis for the growth of religious fanaticism. The European Union should be striving to strengthen dialogue with the Nigerian Government, to bring it to put robust measures in place which will guarantee public order and justice.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, in his brief closing statement, the Danish minister stated that Nigeria has capable political leaders.

      <p sl="sv">The debate here has highlighted the situation between Muslims and Christians. No one can deny that this is devastating and horrifying. It is currently the case that the EU is providing several million euro over a five-year period – almost EUR 680 million. It is clear that, in connection with this donation of aid, we expect resolute demands to be made – and I am convinced that the Commissioner is also making these demands – in respect of human rights and freedoms. I believe that we specifically need to emphasise freedom of religion, in particular, because the concept of human rights and freedoms can be seen as rather ‘limitless’. In Nigeria, but not only in Nigeria, it is about freedom of religion in particular. It is not only the group that has been mentioned here several times that we can turn to; we can approach the government itself. We must not be satisfied with simply expressing our opposition, as has been said here; we must also make demands. We know that Nigeria has a large population and it plays, and wants to play, a major role in Africa. That is something that this country certainly can do, but something more is required of its own government.</p>

The two attacks in December and January left Nigeria with over 200 dead and increasing tensions between the Christian south and Muslim north. Such tensions inside a country prevent the implementation of much-needed structural reforms. They also halt the long-term efforts of the EU to achieve economic, financial, social and political developments, and they destabilise the whole region because of Nigeria’s importance and status in it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Solutions are not simple, and we have to realise that ethnic and religious conflicts are deeply rooted in Nigeria’s history. The government must address the long-term causes of these religious tensions, such as under-development, poverty, unemployment, corruption, access to drinking water, etc. The EU is helping in all these issues, but we must exert more pressure on the government to enforce the rule of law and severely punish the perpetrators of these crimes.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Nigeria is the only country in the world where there are as many Muslims as Christians. Among its greatest political challenges today are to keep the country united and to fight terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In recent months, the extremist Islamic Boko Haram movement has carried out violent bomb attacks on civilians, government buildings and churches. The attack on a church during Christmas Mass was an inconceivably brutal act of terror. The purpose of these violent attacks against Christians is to put a strain on relations between Muslims and Christians and to make the current Nigerian leadership look incapable of maintaining the country’s unity and security. Muhammadu Buhari, the Muslim military leader in the north, has made an impressive display of criticising the efforts by President Goodluck Jonathan’s government to improve security as ineffectual.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Conditions are now ripe for the religious fanatics in the country. It is easy to persuade the enormous numbers of young, unemployed, excluded people in northern Nigeria to be involved in violent, extremist Islamic activity against Christians and, furthermore, western values. Boko Haram is also thought to have links with al-Qaeda. The security situation is also being affected by combatants returning home unemployed from North Africa, Mauritania, Chad and Libya and by illegal weapons flowing out of that region.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we need to look at two things together in this regard. The first is the situation in Nigeria, a country that is involved with the ACP and with which we have good relations. Commissioner, you know better than I do how help is actually being provided here, and that we need to bear in mind that the government does, in actual, fact have a rich country on account of the deposits of raw materials, which, as Mr Šťastný said, should, in fact, be used to provide better social and living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need to realise that Boko Haram puts forward arguments and acts in the same way as other Islamic groups and states do in their persecution of Christians. Seventy-five per cent of all instances of the persecution of people on account of their religious conviction currently involve the persecution of Christians. It is clear that the entire Islamic world – including the representatives of the Islamic faith, although they have no central institutions – is called on here finally to take action against such acts of violence and to clearly distance themselves from these acts. I believe that this is the only available course of action.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have concerns in Syria and in Egypt and similar areas, and we know what the outcome was in Iraq, for example. For that reason, I believe that the fact that the External Action Service intends to appoint a Special Representative for Human Rights for this purpose is important, and, in this regard, the departments dealing with the persecution of Christians in particular must also be represented. This is not something that should only apply to Christians; we need to realise that it is relevant to all religious convictions, which must be permitted and must not be persecuted, but, as Europe, which is founded on Christianity, we should also have the opportunity to state very clearly that Christians must not be persecuted.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I believe that today’s debate again demonstrated Parliament’s strong engagement in supporting human rights and fighting against terrorism. We look forward to Parliament’s continued support for the European Union’s growing engagement with Nigeria. We will increase our contacts and cooperation with Nigeria, which is at a crucial juncture in its history. It faces serious problems, but there are also a lot of opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can the Commission do in response to the troubles faced by Nigeria? Today, we are supporting Nigeria with EUR 200 million in the Niger Delta programme which is our support for fragile peace in the Delta. We are also considering how to support the northern Nigeria programme, where there are many development challenges. Just to mention one, education: northern Nigeria has some of the worst education indicators in the world with only 74% attending school and only about 5% finishing a full primary cycle. In effect, Boko Haram is deliberately depriving Nigerian children of the opportunity to better themselves, help their families and communities and find a way out of poverty. This means that engagement with Nigeria should be crucial.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union regularly raises issues about religious freedoms with Nigeria in the context of the human rights dialogue. The rights of Christians should not be seen independently from the rights of Muslims in the country. I believe that this dialogue on human rights will be strengthened in the future. The High Representative has already engaged a great deal and she has a couple of new proposals that were discussed during the informal meetings with Foreign Affairs Ministers held last week in Denmark.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can the European Union help Nigeria against Boko Haram? Following the ministerial meeting between the European Union and Nigeria, we have started to work on the package of support for Nigeria’s counter-terrorist methods. This will be additional to, and complementary with, the EU Member States’ action. It will focus on the root causes of radicalisation, especially poverty, marginalisation in society and lack of jobs. It will also have a dimension of justice and the rule of law. Nigeria is defining its own counter-terrorism strategy, which the EU will support fully, in accordance with human rights issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the killing of two European hostages, I would just repeat the High Representative’s statement of 9 March: ‘I want to express my condolences to both families of the hostages in Nigeria for the tragic loss. We condemn in the strongest possible terms criminal actions like the taking of hostages. Perpetrators must be brought to justice and held accountable for their crimes’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last point I would like to emphasise concerns oil revenues. I believe that the Commission has now made a proposal for more transparency on the reporting of profits from natural wealth by the companies.

      <p sl="en">The clashes in Nigeria have been in the news during the recent months, yet we practically lack feedback from HR/VP on these alarming developments. Now the EP is coming forward with its resolution on the social unrest and religiously motivated persecution of Christians in Nigeria. EP has repeatedly called on the EEAS to mainstream the aspect of freedom of religion and belief in its human rights dialogue with third countries and to train its staff on this. Religiously motivated intolerance in the world is on the rise and the EU has to step up its efforts to tackle this issue sooner rather than later. I call on the EU, together with the UN, to contribute to a peaceful settlement between the religious communities in Nigeria. It is our common interests to stop the spreading of violence towards Christian communities. Nigeria is among the resource richest countries in Africa with significant economic growth, but also among the most corrupt. The EU must, in its relations with Nigeria, seriously push for social and economic reforms that would channel the revenues from the oil industry for education and economic and social development, instead of re-distributing them among the elites. This will be the best way to avoid further clashes between religious communities.</p>

      <p sl="en">The recent attacks on Christians in Nigeria come amid worsening religious and ethnic tensions leading to deterioration in the precarious human rights situation in the country. I utterly condemn the suicide bombing of a service at St. Finbar’s Church in Jos on 11 March which killed at least four people. My sympathies are with the families of the dead and wounded and I call upon the Nigerian Federal and State governments to bring those behind the bombing to justice while doing more to protect vulnerable communities, especially Christians, in northern and central parts of the country. The EU must support stability in Nigeria. However, Nigeria must demonstrate its willingness to end religious strife as well as re-commit itself to guaranteeing basic human rights including freedom of religion. The Nigerian Government must intervene in cases of those tried under Sharia law, especially those sentenced to death, amputation, flogging or other inhuman treatments. I am particularly concerned about women who are being lashed for committing adultery, especially in instances of rape. Nigeria must also show respect for the rights of its LGBT community and reconsider legislation criminalising homosexuality, which, under Sharia law in the north, is punishable by stoning to death.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statements by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Belarus [2012/2581(RSP) ].</p>

    <intervention id="3-555-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very glad to be here today to discuss the situation in Belarus on behalf of High Representative/Vice-President Ashton.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is increasingly concerned about the continued lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law in Belarus. Over the last months, the situation has gone from bad to worse, with further repressive measures and policies towards civil society and political opposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are many concerns. The first of them is the immediate and unconditional release of all 12 political prisoners and their rehabilitation. The presence of political prisoners in the heart of Europe is a shame.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also deeply concerned about reports of torture and inhumane prison conditions of political prisoners. The Belarusian authorities are under an absolute obligation to ensure the respect of the prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment and have a responsibility to investigate reports thereof.</p>
      <p sl="en">All harassment of members of the opposition, and of civil society, must stop, and their freedom of movement cannot be impeded. The increasingly draconian legislation that will further restrict the Belarusian citizens’ freedoms of assembly and association, as well as provision of support to civil society, must be rolled back.</p>
      <p sl="en">Belarus remains the only country in Europe to still apply capital punishment. As already highlighted in this House, the European Union remains opposed to capital punishment under all circumstances. Along the lines of the Parliament’s resolution of 16 February, the European Union calls on the authorities of Belarus not to carry out the executions of Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalyov, and to introduce a moratorium on capital punishment in view of its eventual abolition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s policies are principled. We remain committed to a visible and united defence of our values – human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. It is clear that we cannot stay idle in face of developments in a country that is neighbouring three of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s restrictive measures are an important instrument to keep up political pressure, to strengthen our political message to Belarus. The European Union has repeatedly stressed that they remain open and under constant review. In January, the Council expanded the criteria to target those responsible for serious violations of human rights, the repression of civil society and opposition and persons or entities benefiting from or supporting the regime. As highlighted by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton after the February Foreign Affairs Council, work is currently ongoing in view of a decision to be taken by the 23 March Foreign Affairs Council, on the basis of a list of business interests supporting the regime or drawing benefits from it.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made clear that the EU’s policies are not directed against Belarus as such, nor against its people. The EU maintains its policy of critical engagement, including through dialogue and the Eastern Partnership. We remain ready to develop our bilateral relations, depending on progress made by the authorities towards the respect for the principles of democracy, human rights and rule of law. As highlighted by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton in her joint statement with Secretary of State Clinton in December 2011, the European Union remains willing to assist Belarus to meet its obligations in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">The engagement with Belarusian civil society, the political opposition and the public at large is a crucial element of the EU’s policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">We remain ready to launch negotiations for visa facilitation and readmission agreements which would enhance people-to-people contacts to the benefit of the Belarusian population. It is regrettable that the Belarusian authorities have so far failed our invitation to start negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will also step up our dialogue with civil society and the political opposition through a ‘European dialogue on modernisation’ with the Belarusian society on necessary reforms for the modernisation of Belarus and on the related potential development of relations with the European Union, as well as possible EU support in this regard. The European Union and its Member States want to reach out to Belarus and to share their successful experience of transition to democracy and market economy. Once conditions are ripe, the EU will also be ready to provide the right conditions for EU companies and financial institutions to support the country’s transformation and to invest in Belarus’s future privatisation process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European dialogue will be launched in Brussels on 29 March in Brussels: what we want to achieve is an open exercise taking in all political forces, and civil society, with substantial involvement by EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In difficult times, it is important to maintain channels also of communication and information. This is why the EU upgraded its delegation in Minsk last summer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Further to the request by the Belarusian authorities on 28 February that the EU Head of Delegation and the Ambassador of Poland should leave the country for consultations, the European Union agreed in a determined act of solidarity to withdraw all EU ambassadors for consultations. Our ambassadors fulfil a crucial function on the ground in Belarus as channels of communication and information and we remain committed to a unified and coordinated approach also to the issue of their return.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, nothing has happened until now to encourage us to change our policies towards the authorities in Minsk. Not the release of political prisoners and their rehabilitation. The persecution of opposition figures since the elections of December 2010 continues. Breaches of human rights continue. And, yes, further sanctions will probably not improve our bilateral relations with Minsk. This is regrettable but it is unavoidable if we are to remain true to our values.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can only thank the honourable Members for their determination to face this difficult issue head-on. We owe it to the people of Belarus to show that we have solidarity with them in these difficult times and that there will be a European future when conditions allow.</p>
      <p sl="en">The support of Members of this House in the unfolding situation in Belarus since the presidential elections of 19 December 2010 has been crucial to keep the issue high on the EU’s agenda. It has also been crucial to maintain the political pressure on Belarus to change its current repressive policies and to take the necessary steps, which would allow it to find its proper place in European cooperation. We look forward to examining the resolution that this House will adopt tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Piebalgs, thank you very much for your very long, comprehensive and truthful policy statement on cooperation with Belarus. The fact is that our relations with Belarus – with our neighbour – and the domestic situation in Belarus are often discussed in this Chamber, and recently even very often. It was only in February that we discussed or we appealed for a moratorium on the use of capital punishment in Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, however, we are talking about the response of the Union to the diplomatic war declared on Europe two weeks ago by the authorities in Minsk. The effect of this war may be an intensification of the country’s self-imposed isolation. I hope this prospect does not amuse anyone at all – not even anyone in Belarus, not even the undemocratically elected authorities – because the only consequence of greater isolation would be to advance the process by which Belarus is losing its independence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the irrational decision to ask the Ambassador of Poland and the EU Head of Delegation to leave Minsk, it is still possible to prevent the situation from deteriorating further. There is still time for Belarus to resume elementary relations with the Western world, but, of course, this would need the release of political prisoners, an end to the repression of opposition activists, independent journalists and human rights defenders, and preparations for parliamentary elections to be held in accordance with elementary, minimum European principles. In short, it is time for change, and this is an appeal to Minsk, before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as we state in our resolution, and as Mr Protasiewicz mentioned, the Belarus regime chooses self-isolation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, it isolates not only itself but also the Belarusian people. This is not what we want. In our resolution and in our demands, we express solidarity with the Belarusian people. We want to show them – and we want them to know – that here in the European Parliament, in the European Union, we express our solidarity, our help and our hope that, in a similar way to Belarus’s neighbours, Belarusian society and the Belarusian state will one day move along the path towards more human rights, more civic rights, more democracy and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Belarusian economy is in dire straits. If we look at the budget deficit, the current account deficit and the future prospects, there is no way for an improvement without reforms. These reforms are not possible without reforming society, engaging in dialogue with young people, independent groups, the opposition, journalists and trade unions. Only in this way can a society – whether it is the Belarusian society or any other – be stable, and only in this way can both the society and the economy improve.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what we wanted to express in our resolution, part of which, of course, comprises our demands to release all political prisoners, no matter what their political affiliation. This is what we would like to express in our joint resolution. I think it is the view not only of the Socialists and Democrats but all democratic groups in this House.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the ALDE Group applauds the sound decision of the Member States to summon their ambassadors from Minsk to their respective ministries for consultations following the diplomatic conflict between the EU and Belarus.</p>
      <p sl="de">The behaviour of President Lukashenko, both domestically and internationally, is scandalous, and the EU should not flatter him and his cronies by sending our representatives to Minsk at ambassadorial level. Lukashenko has consistently ignored the international commitments of Belarus as a Member State of the OSCE. I would not like to see the distinguished ambassadors of the EU presenting their credentials to a criminal dictator.</p>
      <p sl="de">There can be no progress in relations between the European Union and Belarus until the regime implements democratic reforms. Meanwhile, we should concentrate our efforts on engaging Belarusian civil society and the democratic opposition.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also encourage the International Ice Hockey Federation to move the 2014 World Championship from Belarus to another location. Lukashenko does not deserve the honour of hosting the championship. A dictator does not understand the principles of democracy; therefore, he does not understand the principle of sport: that of free competition.</p>

    <intervention id="3-559-000" speaker_id="96731" name="Werner Schulz" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Belarus is in a state of emergency. Since the fraudulent re-election of President Lukashenko, the dictator has treated the opposition with brutal severity and terror.</p>
      <p sl="de">Dozens of people, whose only crimes were to demand democracy and participation, have been given long prison sentences, with their confessions being obtained under torture. For this reason, the EU has imposed a travel ban for supporters of the regime who were involved in this, and it has also frozen their foreign accounts. This is a strategy, which, on the one hand, exerts pressure on the system and, on the other, supports civil society.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we should look closely at the extent to which these measures actually work, and why the Belarusian Interior Minister is able to travel to the Interpol conference in Lyon, for example, while the sons of the dictator can explore the world with total impunity as members of the National Olympic Committee. The freezing of accounts, which is a matter for the individual EU Member States, is also questionable.</p>
      <p sl="de">As most companies in Belarus are owned by the state, the EU, with a trade surplus of USD 6 billion last year, has, unfortunately, become the largest supporter of Lukashenko’s system, thereby keeping it going.</p>
      <p sl="de">Targeted measures that affect the regime but harm the people in the country as little as possible would therefore be necessary. Economic sanctions against selected companies and intermediaries would have this effect, as the export of fertilisers, steel and crude oil products is 100% dependent on the West.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, I do not think it is a good idea to relocate the World Ice Hockey Championships. This symbolic gesture may satisfy a few people, but it will affect the wrong people and is more likely to provide fuel for the dictator’s propaganda. Indeed, we experienced this with the Olympics boycott in Moscow, and we refrained from taking this route in connection with Beijing. After all, if we were to apply the method of boycotting sport consistently, we would also have to refuse to hold the European Football Championships in Ukraine.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is a good resolution. It mentions all the things we always mention – maintenance of economic sanctions, release of political prisoners and a guarantee of the basic conditions needed for political cooperation, public activity and a free society. It demands the release of political prisoners, and I personally am very pleased that it includes the names of Dmitry Bandarenka and Ivan Shyla – people I have met and know personally. However, there is something else important here, something we also talk about from time to time – the support the European Union gives to free media, because only free media can change the way Belarusians see their situation, so that in the free elections which are sure to come sooner or later, they will be able to vote with real freedom, democratically and in accordance with their own wishes.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What is new here, and its importance should be stressed, is that in contrast to one of the previous speakers, I think it is, in fact, very important that we have called for the Ice Hockey World Championships to be moved to another country than Belarus. Why? It is because a celebration such as a world championships must not be held in a place or a country where there is no cause for celebration, where political activists are in prison, and where torture is used on oppositionists. This is an important new aspect, and we should welcome its inclusion in the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Commissioner, I have four children. When one of my children gets angry with another, that second one always goes off to join a third. Why does he go off? It is because he has somewhere to go. Europe’s relations with Belarus can actually be compared to relations between children. If we are not careful, we may send Belarus away from Europe altogether, because it has somewhere to go. Where is that? It is Russia, where, in recent years, democratic expression has decreased, not increased.</p>
      <p sl="lv">If we should like Belarus to get closer to Europe, then we must act very carefully and wisely. We must use both the carrot and the stick. The carrot would be not to reduce but to increase economic cooperation with Belarus. Through economic cooperation, we will achieve a situation where a section of the people become wealthier, and a prosperous class will be created. We can see that throughout North Africa, and in Russia itself, it is, in fact, the middle class, the affluent middle class, that demands democratic change in a country. The stick must be political sanctions, which, of course, maintain the requirements for the Belarus Government to respect human rights. Thank you for your attention.</p>

    <intervention id="3-562-000" speaker_id="34232" name="Kristian Vigenin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="bg">Mr President, the subject of today’s debate is another extension of the sanctions against the Lukashenko regime and the fact that this is virtually causing a diplomatic war between Belarus and the European Union. I think that, as stated in the draft resolution, the European Union is responding correctly by not allowing itself to be split into good and bad Member States. It is providing an adequate response by clearly signalling to Lukashenko that the Member States of the European Union or the European Union as a whole cannot be blackmailed in this way.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, the big question which we cannot basically find the answer to is: what else can we do as a European Parliament, a European Union and based on the commitment of individual Member States to change the situation in this country? How can we support civil society and what else can we do so that political prisoners are freed and to ensure that there will be no more political prisoners in Belarus? How should we bring about a gradual shift towards democratisation in Belarus so that the next elections will at least be a little more honest and a little more democratic than what we saw during the previous parliamentary elections?</p>
      <p sl="bg">I think that we do not seem to be showing enough imagination in this area, and the methods we are resorting to seem again to be either tightening the sanctions or applying what is the new element in this resolution: we mention the option of imposing targeted economic sanctions. We must, of course, carefully remark at this point that they must not affect the citizens of Belarus. We are also talking about the World Ice Hockey Championships and it possibly being moved somewhere other than Belarus. I feel that this sounds more like a desperate move on our part. If this action is implemented, let us give it a try, but I do not think that it will produce the result sought after.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, it is important for us not to close the door and to use every opportunity. We will do this under the auspices of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. We will continue our efforts, and let us still hope that we achieve results. We must all put our heads together about how to change this situation.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, although, by and large, I support all the points in this resolution, particularly regarding sanctions that are directed against those who are directly responsible for repressive acts against representatives of political and social organisations in Belarus, I think that it is not right to include the point on the ice hockey championships in the resolution. Firstly, the championship is in 2014, and there is still time to achieve progress, instead of saying that there will be none by 2014. Secondly, it is very important to understand that during the championship, a very large number of people will have come to Belarus. The fans and many others will be able to have direct contact with Belarusians and freely express their opinions and, to a certain extent, pass on information, perhaps not through politicians, but directly, on what the situation is. This will actually be of help to us. The championship will assist the process for which we are striving, rather than hampering it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I think it is time we said what the European Union’s policy on Belarus has been in recent years, what it is like, and how it is viewed in Minsk. Fantasies and illusions; every six months, a change of position; thaws and freezes. It has ended the way it has, and now we are wondering what to do about it. So I propose that instead of starting with harsh words and a show of sabre-rattling, it is time we gave the matter some thought and began at last to pursue a consistent policy, so that the Member States do not work against each other or talk officially about human rights while quietly agreeing terms over some nice little investment, because all of this is getting us nowhere, and Belarus is going nowhere. The only one who is happy about all this is Mr Lukashenko.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The most important thing today is to support the opposition, to show unequivocal support for the opposition, and demonstrate that it is they who are our partners. Lukashenko must hear from us that if there is to be another – quote – ‘thaw’, it will only happen in connection with specific changes. First and foremost, this means freedom for the press, independent newspapers, freedom in the Internet and an end to censorship. We should give him these conditions. He will never change his position on elections, because he cannot bring himself to do this. If we start making another agreement with him about some kind of election, we will end up going back to the same policy: fantasies, mood swings, every six months a new approach from the European Union – all this will only encourage Lukashenko to treat the opposition badly and keep oppositionists in prison. I have one simple piece of advice – we need to be consistent.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Belarus is serious, and it is getting worse. The number of arrests of politicians is growing, as is the number of questionable trials, and threats to opponents of the regime and the press. There are bans on visas for journeys to and from the European Union. Tragically, following a questionable trial with unconvincing evidence, the death penalty was imposed on two young men. The time and place when the sentence will be carried out has been kept secret, even from their relatives. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that the expulsion of ambassadors confirms that the regime’s nerves are failing, and so we must continue to stress that the development of our relations is directly dependent on its ability to fulfil commitments in the sphere of human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Of course, Belarus is a small state, and is not rich in natural or energy resources. However, in stepping up the sanctions against the Lukashenko regime, we must refrain from the double standards that we sometimes adopt when assessing similar events, in Russia, for instance. Specific sanctions against the main actors within the regime must be widened, to include a ban on travelling to the European Union and freezing property and bank accounts. Sanctions must be directed against specific persons and entrepreneurs who support the regime, but not against the people or small traders. If we suspend cooperation with Belarus, then it is the people of Belarus that will suffer most and, for our part, we shall no longer be their allies, but people who have done them wrong. The regime’s leadership will pull through, though, by putting the blame for its difficulties on us. Our sanctions must serve as a political tool, and that means they should also support the civil society of Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, will a Cold War gust and the expulsion of ambassadors lead to a return to dialogue? The authorities in Minsk can still choose the sort of relationship they want to have with the European Union. However, it is regrettable that recently, they seem to be turning more and more into a dead end of isolationism. This means that once again, there will be no choice in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Belarus. Minsk could revive relations with the European Union by freeing and rehabilitating all political prisoners, and this would not mean giving in to EU pressure, but would be a step towards implementing fundamental human rights in the country. I believe that both Belarus’ partners in Euronest and Russia should encourage Belarus to take such action. The EU does not want to worsen relations, which have already hit rock bottom, so that ordinary people in the EU and Belarus do not suffer. There are no insurmountable arguments that would prevent European Union countries from cooperating with their neighbour Belarus. The fate of that country will be decided in Belarus itself and we should therefore welcome the increased activity of the National Platform of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum. Recently, members of the opposition and journalists were prevented from leaving the country and such cases are becoming more frequent. I believe that the European Union should draw attention to such things and require Minsk to also implement freedom of movement, which is one of the fundamental rules of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mr Piebalgs, I have already thanked the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, at the meeting of the Committee on Development, for the fact that this time, decisions on Belarus were fast, unequivocal and specific. All the indications are that the European Union’s reaction has made an impression on the President of Belarus, so perhaps we have at last found a way to make what we do about Belarus more effective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This method is to take action which, for a variety of reasons, will be painful for the Belarusian authorities. So I agree with Mr Migalski that Belarus should not be the host of the Ice Hockey World Championships in 2014. Why? It is because the championships would certainly be an opportunity for President Lukashenko to get himself some good publicity and to present Belarus as a normal country where normal sports competitions are held. However, this is not true. It is not a normal country; it is a country where fundamental human rights are violated and where there is no democracy, and the world championships should not be held in a place whose people are denied fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Incidentally, the tolerant attitude to sport seen in politics meant that the Beijing Olympics did not result in any beneficial changes in China in the field of human rights, so the argument for tolerance is difficult to accept. We must not allow the neutral character of sport to be used to manipulate public opinion and build a false image of normality. So moving the world championships is an important demand and I fully support it.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, escalating tensions between the European Union and Belarus have reached an unprecedented point, culminating in mutual withdrawal of ambassadors. I think that the fact that Belarus is a neighbouring country, as well as its importance within the Eastern Partnership, are reasons to seek a solution to this situation, and I believe we need to get the regime in Minsk to respect the fundamental rights of citizens and allow the establishment of democracy in the country. To achieve this, concrete progress should be made, such as the termination of persecutions against the opposition, the release of political prisoners, the organisation of free elections and an opening of Belarus to European values. Last but not least, we must consider the fact that Belarusian citizens, internationally isolated, are suffering once more, hardly coping with economic hardship, poverty, record inflation and a huge trade deficit.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the opposition in Belarus is under significant pressure from the Lukashenko administration. Many civil rights activists are prohibited from travelling, the offices of organisations have been investigated, computers have been taken away and leaders have been detained. According to the latest information we have, for the fourth time now, the Belarusian Minister for Justice has rejected the application for the registration of the Christian Democracy party.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I support the extension of all sanctions as well as the demands to release political prisoners. I also wish to express my support for the proposal made by Ms Ojuland and Mr Šťastný that we should all appeal to the International Ice Hockey Federation, which is holding its next congress in Helsinki, for the arrangements for Belarus to host the games in 2014 to be cancelled. This is not a question of a boycott – boycotts always harm sport. The tournament should go ahead, but not in Belarus. It should not be made to boost Lukashenko’s prestige.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the deterioration of relations with Belarus places the EU in a paradoxical and undesirable situation – that of having diplomatic tensions with a neighbouring state, a member of the Eastern Partnership. However, this state of affairs will change only when Lukashenko’s regime ceases its political repression of the opposition and civil society. The reaction of authorities is only isolating the country internationally. For instance, the latest report submitted by Reporters Without Borders lists Belarus as an enemy of the Internet because of the restrictions on online expression, while the IMF has recently announced its refusal to negotiate a loan with this country. However, it is primarily the population who feels the economic consequences.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Mr Piebalgs, for many years, we have all witnessed these strange scenes and cat-and-mouse games being played by President Lukashenko, who makes eyes first at the West and then at Moscow, while at the same time destroying the opposition with a heavy hand, attacking journalists, damaging non-governmental organisations and fighting national minorities – things which, in fact, he is still doing. So I am very pleased that this reaction, this joint reaction and the recall of ambassadors for consultations, is the first sign of a joint reaction from the European Union – not just the EU institutions, but also the Member States. Furthermore, I hope we will continue to be equally consistent – both the EU institutions and the Member States – in our dealings with the Lukashenko regime, and, of course, this also means the Ice Hockey World Championships, which definitely should not be held in Belarus, because we should not give Mr Lukashenko reason to celebrate.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, although, at the Eastern Partnership summit in Prague, this country committed to respect human rights, it is becoming increasingly disreputable. I think Belarus is the closest country to the European Union and the furthest away from European values. I would like to point out that sanctions should also be applied within the Eastern Partnership. We need to enter into discussions with members of this partnership, especially with neighbouring countries, in order to put pressure on the regime in Minsk to change its attitude, to the extent that somebody like Lukashenko is capable of doing. However, I have serious doubts about Lukashenko’s willingness to change his behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Why should we not cooperate with Russia as well in this endeavour? For Russia would have an opportunity to show its commitment to values that are human, perennial and not specific only to the European Union, as Russia, too, adheres to international documents, and I mean, in particular, UN documents.</p>

      <p sl="en">EU policy aims to remain engaged with the country and its people.

This is why the EU should continue to engage, and I understand some of the decisions taken will always be discussed in this House.

Recently, a lot has been said about freedom of speech and democratic values which are violated in Belarus. Behind that are standing different national and financial groups of European Parliament lobbyists. Nobody wants real dialogue with the current governing power in Belarus. Why then does the EU not talk about China, where the number of political prisoners is a hundred times higher? I do not understand those who cover their financial interests by ‘democratic values’. We become hilarious and vulnerable when, because of a bunch of political losers, we want to harm attitudes both towards the people of Belarus and the important sporting event, the World Ice Hockey Championship.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission is well aware of the threat piracy is posing to European – and not only European – ships and crews. It is unacceptable that criminal gangs are allowed to continue to take the international shipping lanes hostage and bring suffering to thousands of seafarers and their families – not to mention the threat to the stability and prosperity of the region and Somalia itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all agree that only a comprehensive approach can bring a sustainable solution to the problem of piracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Containing maritime piracy at sea and ending impunity are two important elements of the EU’s comprehensive approach to combat piracy. Others relate to building regional capacities and the stabilisation of Somalia itself. Also, we definitely should not forget cooperation with the maritime industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to containing piracy at sea, the most visible of all EU counter-piracy action is EU NAVFOR – Operation Atalanta. The Council has just decided to prolong its mandate to December 2014.</p>
      <p sl="en">But how do we make sure justice is served, once suspects have been arrested by the naval forces? One way of addressing impunity is by the prosecution of piracy suspects in the region. The Commission directly supports countries in the region which have accepted transfers for prosecution by EU NAVFOR and established a joint programme with the UN in support of judicial capacities. This cooperation is an excellent example of how Commission programmes and common security and defence policy actions go hand in hand.</p>
      <p sl="en">Piracy has to be understood as organised crime that is happening at sea and on land. In the long run, only the establishment of the rule of law, good governance and economic development will bring the solutions we are seeking. The EU is therefore strongly committed to supporting Somalia in finding a political solution to the ongoing crisis. At the recent London conference, the international community showed strong determination to support the transition process in Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="en">To date, the EU is the biggest donor to Somalia, having committed EUR 415 million for development aid through the European Development Fund for the period 2008 to 2013. On top of these bilateral funds come additional budget funds from horizontal lines and EUR 77 million during 2011 for humanitarian aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">Part of the new development funds will be directed to supporting the fishing industry, building alternative livelihoods and helping coastal communities and rural development more generally, thus tackling some of the root causes of piracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is also supporting the development of Somali security capacities. In addition to the training of police officers – we also provide some financial support if they stay in the service of the Somali Government – we are the main donor to the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, which is funded through the African Peace Facility. Since 2007 the European Union has provided EUR 325 million and the Commission is proposing additional support for AMISOM.</p>
      <p sl="en">As in the area of counter-piracy efforts, Commission action is closely linked with Council-led CSDP actions such as the EU Training Mission to Somalia (EUTM).</p>
      <p sl="en">There is also an important role for the maritime industry to play in containing the threat of piracy. It is vital to implement International Maritime Organisation-supported ‘best management practices’ on board ships under EU Member State flags.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also assure you that the Commission is following very closely the case of two Italian marines, Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, who are now in custody in India. We have been in constant touch with the Italian Government on this issue from the beginning. Following Italy’s request for assistance, the EU has raised the issue with the Indian authorities both in Brussels and in New Delhi, encouraging a positive outcome as soon as possible. Yesterday, the High Representative, Cathy Ashton, also discussed these matters with Prime Minister Mario Monti, who thanked the High Representative for the EU’s efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that we need to address this issue in the broader context of our cooperation on counter-piracy and, more specifically, the regulation of armed protection aboard ships. We need to see what lessons we can learn to prevent this type of incident from happening ever again. The European Union and India had already agreed in principle to work on these broader policy issues, and this is what we are currently also taking forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we have to differentiate between this case of EU Member States’ security forces protecting commercial shipments and using private contractors for armed deterrence on board commercial ships and even distant fishing vessels.</p>
      <p sl="en">Due to the immensity of the sea area where Somali pirates now operate and the scarce naval resources available to protect this shipping lane, the industry has had no other choice than to turn to the services provided by privately contracted armed security personnel on board ships transiting the high-risk areas. This is an increasing phenomenon that we cannot ignore.</p>
      <p sl="en">The International Maritime Organisation has already addressed this item and issued interim recommendations but, as no solution to piracy is apparent in the short term, we believe this must be addressed in more depth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not confident with the idea of self-regulation by this new business in view of the risks involved in this kind of activity, which can potentially lead to the – sometimes lethal – use of force. In this regard, we think that the IMO is the international body that should lead to the development of very clear, stringent rules and, in particular, of a mandatory instrument.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ensuring prosecution of pirates captured at sea only takes care of one part of the problem. It is therefore vital to increase the ‘risk/reward’ ratio for those who benefit most from piracy, and the EU has decided to step up its efforts to break the underlying business model. Law enforcement agencies of EU Member States, Interpol and Europol are currently cooperating, not only in attempting to trace any flows going into EU Member States, but also in collecting evidence packages against leaders, financiers and instigators.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another element of the EU comprehensive approach is the support of the region. It is in the strategic interest of regional countries to engage in the fight against piracy. The EU is definitely keen to assist and enhance local ownership. This is why the European Union has been a strong supporter of the Eastern and Southern Africa – Indian Ocean Regional Strategy and Action Plan, which was adopted in October 2010 in Mauritius to fight piracy and promote maritime security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Support measures are under way, and up to EUR 40 million of further support is currently under consideration. We have also been enhancing the surveillance capacities of our partner countries through the EU’s network of fisheries partnership agreements, which strengthen our relations with the countries in the Western Indian Ocean area, and the regional surveillance programme, which we have been financing with EUR 10 million from 2007 to 2011, and which is going to be renewed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Critical Maritime Routes Programme funded under the Instrument for Stability has also focused since 2009 on the security and safety of essential maritime routes in the areas affected by piracy. In close coordination with the IMO, one of the projects contributes to the implementation of the regional Djibouti Code of Conduct.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank the European Parliament especially for requesting a pilot project on ‘maritime awareness’, which will provide technical tools to help the authorities to be aware of what goes on at sea. These programmes will work very closely with the planned Regional Maritime Capacity Building Mission.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner, no one could have predicted a few years ago that piracy would be such a serious threat today to international trade and shipping and to regional and international security. Above all, however, piracy is a threat to the security and lives of thousands of seafarers and workers on ships that cross the danger zones in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p sl="el">As we speak, hundreds of seafarers are being held hostage. They and their families will live on tenterhooks for hours, days or even months. The humanitarian dimension of piracy alone forces us to take more decisive action. Piracy has become a very lucrative business for pirates, with large profits at little risk. Their tactics are developing and their operational capacity is increasing impressively in an area of huge strategic importance to the international economy. Three million barrels of oil and approximately 50% of global container trade cross this area every day. The annual cost of piracy is calculated to be between USD 7 and 12 billion.</p>
      <p sl="el">Piracy is a strategic-type threat; it is a shared challenge that requires collective action. The causes of piracy are rooted on land, but their results are felt at sea. With the biggest fleet in the world, the European Union needs to act more decisively. Today, we need to take a decisive lead in international efforts to combat piracy. The coming months will be crucial.</p>
      <p sl="el">In coordination with the International Maritime Organisation, the UN and NATO, it is high time that we identified the flow of illegal and black money, that we plugged legal loopholes, so that pirates can be prosecuted effectively, that we uprooted the diaspora of pirate bases in the area as a whole, and that we promoted the definition of exclusive economic zones in the area in accordance with the international law of the sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioner, I listened very carefully to what you said. I would add that another positive step has been made with the appointment of a representative in the Horn of Africa. That is a positive development. As I said, I listened carefully to all the measures. They are all positive. Do you know what is missing as far as I am concerned? Decisiveness. I have not seen the decisiveness we are calling for. We expect far more.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, piracy is a phenomenon which continues to cause us concern and which merits the European institutions’ attention. Last year, there were no fewer than 300 attacks and attempted attacks on ships in a danger zone which, only a few years ago, was limited to the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden, but which has, in the meantime, extended to encompass practically the entire West Indian Ocean. Twenty-five ships were actually hijacked and more than 400 crew members held hostage. We have also had 11 deaths.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In just the first two months of this year, 35 attempted hijackings have already taken place, with three ships actually being hijacked. This situation means that crew members are having to risk their lives simply to do their jobs. However, we are also suffering significant economic loss, directly or indirectly, in the form of demands for ransoms, higher insurance premiums, detours having to be made in order to avoid hazardous areas, Operation Atalanta itself, obviously, higher food prices, etc., the total costs of which could be estimated at many billions. What we therefore need is additional and sustained action.</p>
      <p sl="nl">While Operation Atalanta has, indeed, been extended until the end of 2014, in a few years’ time, the number of ships actively contributing to the operation will be reduced from 35 to 10 and, at one point at the start of this year, that number dropped to as few as three ships. Tackling piracy requires a comprehensive approach, of course – as you have already mentioned – in Somalia itself, in the region.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In addition, we are finding that the pressure on shipping companies to take responsibility for the safety of their ships and crew into their own hands, by employing private security firms, is increasing every day. We therefore need to look very closely at that. A number of EU flag states allow this, others do not. It is desirable that the European Commission comes up with clear guidelines regulating this: for example, to agree arrangements for training criteria for security agencies, procedures concerning the use of arms, recording of incidents, the nature of weapons which may be held on board, etc.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to ask you to comment in greater detail on this and to clarify how you view this matter; and I also ask you not to wait for the IMO. Take action on this issue now and, of course, on any of the other issues which members here are undoubtedly going to raise.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I would like to begin this speech by talking about people. Our first priority is to free the men and women who remain kidnapped by pirates, in whichever sea they operate.</p>
      <p sl="es">Hundreds of human beings are suffering as a result of a crime that has serious psychological consequences. They require specialist attention and recognition, as well as support, which they have not had up to now. The hostages in these kidnappings suffer because of the actions of organised criminal groups, which are very violent and operate outside the European Union. European and state regulations have to recognise this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The humanitarian aid, merchant and fishing fleets that suffer at the hands of piracy are carrying out lawful, honest activities protected by international law. In the case of fishing, good environmental practices are being observed and local development is being supported.</p>
      <p sl="es">From this perspective, the pirates cannot justify their attacks, nor can we allow them to. Therefore, it is necessary to extend Operation Atalanta, and I ask: why has there been a reduction in the resources made available and what is your view on the Somali authorisation to attack pirate bases on the coast? Commissioner, I would like you to answer these two questions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Poverty is what makes many turn to piracy. Today, there are more than 3 500 criminals of this kind operating in organised groups in the Indian Ocean alone. Piracy forces up the cost of operations of shipowners, those working on the seas and public administrations by around EUR 5 billion per year. We will all benefit if we add a fraction of this amount to what we already put towards development and cooperation, because we can eliminate this misery.</p>
      <p sl="es">In 2011, only 13% of the 237 attacks that took place were successful, as opposed to 27% that succeeded in 2010. However, the ransoms paid have broken all records. Let us pledge to insist on this action before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Parliament started to draft a resolution on this, led by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for which I am the Green shadow.</p>
      <p sl="en">We recognise that maritime piracy is an extremely complicated and problematic issue, but we also believe that it is a horizontal one, incorporating development, security and foreign affairs aspects, while the link with transport issues is more secondary. I am given to understand that the reason why the Transport Committee is the leading committee is because the Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport wants to lead on this instead of DG Development.</p>
      <p sl="en">Greens are completely against this shift, as solutions to maritime piracy do not lie primarily with changes to transport policy. Therefore, we welcome the fact that this resolution was taken off the agenda for this plenary session. If Parliament is determined to have a resolution on this, we think it should be led by another committee such as the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, as well as being better timed in order to tie in with the external work and developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apart from the fact that we do not think that the Transport Committee should be leading on this issue, the solutions in the draft resolution are not in line with previous Parliament resolutions on piracy, Somalia and the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, they are too militarily based. We are against further militarisation and strongly in favour of strengthening the criminal justice approach to piracy, as advocated by the United Nations Special Advisor on Piracy, Mr Jack Lang.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Over recent years, the problems with piracy have done nothing but grow. What we are seeing is that more and more ships are being captured, more sailors taken hostage and that the area in which the pirates are operating has grown considerably. The price paid has also increased, in terms of both lives lost and ransoms. Hundreds of seafarers are currently being held captive in camps in Somalia, in a situation that you and I would hope to never find ourselves.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is thus high time to adopt a more robust approach to piracy. This, I believe, involves four elements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">1. The Member States really need to pull out all the stops to free captive sailors and, for me, that also includes targeted actions on the Somali coast.</p>
      <p sl="nl">2. The Member States of the EU now, for once, need to agree to the deployment of certified, armed security personnel on board. At the moment, we have a situation where some Member States allow these security personnel, while others do not. The pirates, however, know exactly how these ships sail and follow them precisely, so they know which ships have no security personnel on board. The result is an extra risk for those ships specifically. Thus, while we are dealing with a security risk, we are also dealing with competition.</p>
      <p sl="nl">3. There are indications that those at the top of the piracy gangs are laundering money via banks in Africa and Europe. This means that the security services need to follow these money trails and ensure that the banks involved are dealt with.</p>
      <p sl="nl">4. Somalia is a lawless society. The Commission needs to produce a plan to set Somalia right. For me, Commissioner Piebalgs, there needs to be a little more ambition, and I would like to hear what you have to say in response.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in this debate, we are also daring to shed light on some uncomfortable truths, truths about the root causes of piracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, there are the fisheries agreements imposed by the European Union which coordinate the shameless pillaging of Somali territorial waters. It is this pillaging and also that of illegal fishing that has ruined the lives of thousands of families of fishermen and made young people turn towards piracy. Every year, USD 450 million worth of fish is caught, depriving the Somali population, one of the poorest populations in the world, of a vital food and economic resource.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another truth that is often brushed under the carpet: the waters off the Horn of Africa have become a veritable dumping ground for toxic waste, waste of any kind, including radioactive waste, which is being dumped in violation of the rules of international law. Ultimately, under the pretext of combating piracy, it is, in fact, foreign policy interests, geostrategic interests and economic interests that are being served.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is the real story; that is how this phenomenon has been able to develop. While we are focusing on this fight which, I agree, is necessary for ensuring the security of our maritime highways, the real bandits – in Africa’s case the multinationals – are continuing to act with total impunity.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, there has been an increase in the number of criminal assaults against fishing, merchant and passenger vessels in international waters. This poses a risk to the lives and security of both crew and passengers and has a significant negative impact on international trade. It is therefore essential to ensure the unimpeded passage and protection of vessels plying their trade legally on the high seas because this is a precondition for international trade. Legal instruments dealing with piracy and armed robbery must be reviewed, updated and adapted to today’s situation as soon as possible, with a view to prosecuting and passing sentence on the perpetrators of such crimes under existing international law. There should be a particular focus on strengthening the security of vessels, on possible assistance for ships’ crews and their family members, the actions of international organisations in the fight against piracy and other important and necessary initiatives. Both political and legislative efforts must be concentrated on developing a global response to the challenges posed by modern piracy and armed assaults on vessels in order to eradicate a phenomenon such as piracy.</p>

I would ask you whether you are aware of how European boats fish within the framework of agreements signed by the European Union, with good practices that could be used as an international model and reference and, furthermore, whether you know that, for example, 80% of local development in the Seychelles comes as a result of there being a European fleet present, which the inhabitants of this region asked for?</p>

If you had listened very carefully to what I was saying, I made a distinction between the fisheries agreements, on the one hand, and illegal fishing, on the other. Clearly, we see this problem of piracy in different ways, since I am also taking into consideration the interests of the African people and the Horn of Africa. We can prolong this debate indefinitely but my text is clear and I think that I have defended a position which is undoubtedly unpopular, but which also needed to be expressed here.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, maritime piracy is not a new topic for us in this House. We had a resolution on this as long ago as 2009. In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we do not want to turn this into a procedural issue, either. We want to help the people concerned and are happy to draw up a resolution jointly with the other committees that feel that they are affected and are able to help. That is therefore the approach that we have decided upon.</p>
      <p sl="de">Maritime piracy is primarily a threat to people. As my fellow Member has already said, it is also a threat to foreign trade, but also to local fisheries. That is also something we must not forget. Most importantly, it is even a threat to aid programmes that need to reach the area and are also threatened. It is also clear that in recent years, precisely as a result of this threat, this profession – which is a very interesting one that is also internationally recognised – is suffering terribly as a result, because this threat continues to exist for the people at local level. First of all, therefore – and this was already included in the 2009 resolution – we would like the EU to take the initiative. The International Maritime Organisation is – with all due respect – too weak and too slow.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to take the initiative – in connection with the legal framework and certification – so that people who are responsible for ensuring security in future do not find themselves in situations like that of two colleagues from Italy, and so that we do not also have an uncertain framework there in future. Thus, we need to tackle this problem and show greater initiative at EU level in order to then place this issue on the international stage. That is what we expect. That is also something that we are happy to discuss with the other committees.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, piracy is a serious problem, although it is not the only one or the most serious problem off the coast of the Horn of Africa. To combat it effectively, the European Union has to put in place a comprehensive strategy for the region. This implies attacking the source of the piracy, which is not located at sea, but on land. It lies in the lack of government, governance and representative bodies to protect the interests of the Somali people. As Operation Atalanta does not fit within such a strategy, it is failing to achieve its objectives, despite its importance as a naval mission in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy. Worse, piracy is now sophisticated and has the wind in its sails, and Al-Shabaab has grown, armed itself, and become more radical.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The principal mandate of Atalanta is to protect international shipping off the Somali coast. However, what is the European Union doing in relation to the many other maritime crimes committed by foreign ships in the same waters, from illegal fishing to dumping of toxic waste? What information has Brussels received about this matter from Atalanta during the three years the operation has already been in place, to fulfil the mandate that it also has regarding fishing within 200 miles of the Somali coast? Can this information be supplied to Parliament? Has the European Union submitted this information to the UN and requested that the Security Council look at it?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Somalia and the region need a strengthened and concerted effort at political, diplomatic, economic and military – on land as well as at sea – levels, involving the UN, the African Union, the United States, the European Union, India, China and other powers, but founded on the concept of human security so that it can meet the Somali people’s need for sovereignty and development, which lie at the root of the piracy industry. Such an effort must produce results in building representative bodies in Somalia, which are demonstrably not being achieved by the artificial Transitional Federal Government sustained by invading troops from neighbouring Ethiopia, and it must not keep ignoring the potential for governance that could expand from the autonomous areas of Puntland and Somaliland, with which the European Union has to work.</p>

This is not a problem that can be solved overnight. It is a problem that has existed since at least 2005. The EU should have an autonomous strategy for Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we look at how much money we have spent in the whole operation and at the results, including in fighting piracy, these are quite limited, because our objectives cannot be achieved until the core question of the governance in Somalia is addressed. The effort is too big for the EU alone. It has to act in concert with others in the international community. How much money could have been saved, though, if something more meaningful had been done for governance in Somalia. Nothing has been done so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our strategy has been to follow the US totally in a very non-critical way. That is why we are where we are and unhappy with the results, including in fighting piracy and hostage taking. Until we address the question of governance in Somalia – and not with a fake institution like the TFG, the transitional government – we will not improve the situation for ships passing through those waters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, Somali pirates are tirelessly attacking cargo boats off their coasts. Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean is not on the decline, as we have just heard. On the contrary, captures of hostages, demands for ransoms, disappearances and robberies on the high seas are becoming more frequent every day. The incidents are not only frequent, but often very violent and it is useless to look towards the past. We must see how we are going to build the future, since pirates are also no longer hesitating to enter the territorial waters of foreign states, so anything is possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, myself, was on a mission a few months ago in the Gulf of Aden with sailors from Operation Atalanta and I can tell you that I am sure that without their brave action, the attacks would be even more frequent, even more violent and even more dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have two fundamental questions. The first concerns the outcomes of the arrests and subsequent detentions of pirates and the problem with regard to their sentencing. Today, when pirates are apprehended, at great risk to the sailors, they are held for a statutory period of time directly on board the ships before being released, and therefore they revert to type and are soon committing acts of piracy again. Also, should we not urgently put in place at least some assistance towards creating a judicial system that allows for sanctions to be imposed against these pirates?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, as has just been highlighted – and I do not share the opinion expressed just a moment ago –Operation Atalanta’s role is essential. It is, in fact, the cornerstone of protecting and fighting against pirates and, personally, I am worried about the growing number of private companies that are ensuring the protection of these ships. What are these companies? Who is in charge of them? What exactly are their prerogatives? We have seen on several international stages that turning to these private companies can lead to serious abuse (abusive use of force, murder of civilians, and so on). Therefore, we must monitor them and limit their use as much as possible. What do you propose, Commissioner?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, what a pity the European Union does not focus its comprehensive approach more effectively on some of the civil areas the Commissioner has described so well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am sorry to say that in regard to piracy, as in so many other areas, the European Union has confused its own institutional ambitions with practical reality, and I am referring here to naval operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since 2008, NATO, using naval forces from North American and European allies, has been engaged in both counter-piracy and maritime counter-terrorism operations in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf areas. But during its Presidency, France saw an opportunity to open a new chapter in EU defence policy and create a maritime dimension for the European Union. Operation Atalanta was born. And the upshot I have to say is costly confusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are now at least three multinational naval operations as well as deployments from individual countries such as Russia, India, China and Japan. There have been some successes, but attacks have escalated and the risk of serious consequences for pirates, as the Commissioner has said, is still too low to outweigh the lucrative rewards.</p>
      <p sl="en">In January 2012, 80 pirates were captured by counter-piracy forces in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, 75% of these were captured by NATO ships, yet maintaining the political will and naval assets for NATO’s operation Ocean Shield has been a challenge, particularly when more or less the same naval assets are being called on for an EU operation. The European Union should do something comprehensive on the civil side.</p>

      <p sl="el">That would be a mistake and you know it would. On the question of piracy in particular, the first operation carried out – Operation Atalanta – was an EU operation; after a delay of several months, NATO followed suit. The first response was European and results were achieved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Madam President, we have got to get our facts right here. There were NATO combined task groups operating in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean well before Atalanta was dreamed up. This was purely an initiative of the French Presidency acting out of Djibouti and that is what brought it all about.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I am talking about is the way the European Union has military ambitions. It should leave military operations to those that know how to do it. We have a very good international alliance for that and it is called NATO.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the earlier speakers mentioned the lack of resources that are deployed. Well, no wonder there is a lack of resources because we have got the same navies producing ships for two different international naval operations. It is ridiculous. The European Union brings no additional naval assets to the table. It does not contribute anything additionally from a naval point of view.</p>
      <p sl="en">So by all means. There is a lot to be done and even the European Union could do something useful if it focused its efforts on some of the civil activities which we have heard described this evening.

      <p sl="el">Madam President,, the absolute poverty and impoverishment of millions of people caused by capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America is being exploited by powerful international circles that are developing piracy as a very profitable business activity that utilises highly frequented trade routes and is linked to the arms and drugs trade and prostitution rings.</p>
      <p sl="el">The problem of piracy and armed robbery at sea has taken on huge proportions and claimed the lives of thousands of seafarers. What illustrates the change in the standard of piracy is the increase in the level of action by piracy gangs, because the objective today is not confined to robbing seafarers and stealing food or other items on board; it now extends to taking ships and crews hostage, selling the cargo and stealing booty worth millions of euro.</p>
      <p sl="el">The concentration in the Horn of Africa and the area as a whole of powerful US, NATO and EU naval forces and naval forces from other countries, such as China, Russia and India, has nothing to do with fighting piracy. Piracy is being used as a pretext, within the framework of their more general geostrategic objectives, to consolidate their position, promote staff plans and control strategically important points in the area, such as the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.</p>
      <p sl="el">Developments in the Persian Gulf, Israeli, UN and NATO aggression against Iran and preparations for another imperialist war will find a naval machine ready for war in the area which is being strengthened on the pretext of piracy. Ships and crews are already being sought to carry military equipment for major military operations by NATO in the Persian Gulf area.</p>
      <p sl="el">The matter is further complicated by the decision by the governments of the Member States of the European Union to place armed guards on merchant vessels. This is creating a very dangerous situation that will have incalculable consequences, due to the threat which it harbours to human life at sea and the transportation by sea of raw materials and cargo.</p>
      <p sl="el">The proposed solution is a no-win solution and it harbours risks to human life at sea, to seafarers and to the people in the area as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, in respect of its main purpose, the EU NAVFOR Operation Atalanta mission should so far be regarded as a success. After all, its main purpose is to protect the supply vessels of the World Food Programme as they deliver food to Somalia. So far, around 674 000 tonnes have been delivered. Not a single tonne of this food has been lost. To that extent, it has certainly achieved its main purpose.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, this mission does, of course, have other objectives, which have been mentioned. In this connection, I believe it is right for us, as the European Union, to be present on the ground in the shape of this mission, as the fact is that, in this regard, the partners working in cooperation with the EU – that is Russia, China and India – find it easier to work with the EU than they do with NATO. We do not need to share this view – and I am sure that we do not share it – but it is nevertheless a fact. This added value provided by the EU is also something that we should utilise.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also support the comprehensive approach that the Commissioner mentioned. After all, we have numerous measures on land, some of which are very creative. For example, we support projects in places where piracy does not occur, in Somaliland, that is to say, in the north-western part of the country. The Commissioner has been there. I think it is good that we are taking a pragmatic approach there and, in so doing, are ensuring that we stabilise the areas that are opposed to piracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would have liked us to have been able to find out more about the money flows. You mentioned Europol and Interpol. Are you able yet to demonstrate successes in this regard, where we are able to say that we have recovered some of the money so that we can determine how the pirates there are funding themselves?</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we should welcome the recent Council decisions on a global approach to piracy relating, firstly, to the appointment of a special representative for the Horn of Africa, which will support diplomatic action by the Union in the area, and secondly, to the new operational mission to extend action by the Atalanta mission and, thirdly, to the preparation of a new mission, within the framework of European defence and security policy, to support the development of capacities at local level.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, it is important that we consider where we have gone wrong over recent years. On the operational side, we really must overcome the obstacles to the activation of the operational centre in Brussels, because that is the only way to guarantee central planning and better coordination between the various EU missions and activities. Also, we need to review the Athena mechanism to secure funding and increase the contribution to those missions. Finally, we need to resolve serious problems to do with timely information for forces on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, however, we need to examine the possible dangers inherent in operations on the Somali coast and focus more on the need to deal with the causes of piracy. As far as the causes are concerned, we all know that instability and poverty in Somalia have pushed simple citizens into this illegal activity. The solution cannot, under any circumstances, be a purely military solution. Alongside military action, we need to strengthen institutions and the rule of law and, most importantly, we need to step up efforts to combat the root causes of piracy, with emphasis on information and awareness-raising and, of course, on growth and job opportunities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the issue of maritime piracy is becoming more and more urgent. We see ransom negotiations not just taking longer, but record ransoms being demanded and the piracy itself becoming more and more violent.</p>
      <p sl="en">Maritime safety is an absolutely fundamental issue for the European Union, and particularly for those nations like the UK, Greece and Spain which have significant shipping interests. However, the fight against piracy cannot and will not be won alone by military means. We need to promote peace and we need development and state-building in Somalia.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is the biggest aid donor to Somalia. We should welcome a fresh approach based on land-based solutions, which would replace the income from piracy with that from economic development on land. I call on the Commission to tackle the lack of economic data that we have, so that the EU can focus its aid on the most relevant sectors. We know about the potential of the livestock and fisheries sector, but we need to look to other sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also call for better cooperation with the Somalia diaspora, which has so far been ignored, but which plays a major role in supporting the Somali economy, particularly through remittances. It is suggested that these remittances could be as much as EUR 800 million every year.</p>
      <p sl="en">From a local point of view, we have a large Somali community in my constituency in Birmingham. Therefore, I call on the Member States to strengthen their integration policy towards the Somali diaspora.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the progress that has been made with the Joint Financial Board, and I also agree that we need a short-term plan to protect our ships and protect our maritime transport and trade, whether that is through Atalanta, or through NATO, or through some form of better coordination between the two. This does not necessarily have to be just a short-term plan, as we also need a long-term plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">Somalia remains one of the poorest countries in the world, where a quarter of the population rely on the World Food Programme.

      <p sl="pt">In this regard, it is necessary for there to be a genuine development policy that respects the sovereignty of these countries and people.

It would have been important for all of us to hear directly from her the latest updates on the situation involving the two Italian marines unjustly imprisoned in India after being arrested following the military operation against piracy in which they were involved. I am sorry not to be able to hear Baroness Ashton speak, and I hope that Mr Piebalgs’s response will provide more precise details about the progress made in the last few days.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is not just an Italian issue, it is very much a European issue, because – you see – the exclusive jurisdiction of the country flying the flag is a universally recognised principle of international law, and the Indian authorities having brought it into doubt risks undermining the very heart of the battle against piracy by the international community and the European Union itself, which, as we have said, is involved in the Atalanta mission. Therefore, I appeal to the EU institutions to make all possible diplomatic efforts to repatriate our soldiers, ensure international law is upheld and make sure that they are the subject of a fair and transparent investigation in their country of origin.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, Madam President, I would like to comment on the many speeches I have heard from my fellow Members from the radical left. Frankly, I am convinced that Europe must be committed on a political and diplomatic level to help Somalia and all struggling countries to develop, but this cannot be a sufficient response to the hundreds of hostages and families waiting for their loved ones to come home, who are tired of talk and want practical solutions in the matter of international security.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, all those present know that piracy on the high seas is a constant and growing threat to human life, safety and development, since it is a breeding ground for violence and political instability in Somalia and the Horn of Africa.</p>
      <p sl="es">In figures, piracy in the Gulf of Aden in the last year resulted in more than a dozen deaths from 30 attacks, 200 captured pirates and nearly 200 hostages. This is an unprecedented situation that is affecting humanitarian aid for some six million people who need help due to drought and famine in the region; a humanitarian crisis that has already caused the deaths of thousands of people.</p>
      <p sl="es">The amount of money that shipping companies are spending on security is 40 times greater than the aid given to Somalia by the European Union. Although we cannot underestimate the global effort being made through operations such as Atalanta and the operations instigated by NATO, more effort and more commitments are required. These efforts absolutely must include an anti-piracy strategy driven and supported by the leaders of Central and East Africa.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fight against piracy has become a global issue that needs a joint and firm response, with a set of effective actions to also tackle the root causes of this phenomenon: youth unemployment, famine, drought and political instability. We cannot forget that, according to the United Nations, 40% of profits from piracy in Somalia have been used to finance local employment and have been invested in infrastructure for those most in need.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I call on the Commission and the Council to continue taking firm measures to tackle the root of the problem. Helping the Horn of Africa to end piracy, which is not only on the increase but is also becoming increasingly violent, must continue to be our priority.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this is an important debate, as the piracy off the Somali coast – and, in fact, in a constantly increasing area of the Indian Ocean – is a very serious problem.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Time is pressing, as innocent crew members are becoming the victims of violence and facing unacceptable risks. Four hundred and fifty to 600 crew members are currently being held captive. In addition, I would also like to join our fellow Members from Italy in drawing attention to the plight of the Italian soldiers being held in India.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I value Europe’s collaboration in order to deploy European naval vessels in the Atalanta mission, but we need to do more and make greater efforts to effectively combat piracy. The pirates are becoming ever more violent, and their arsenal is becoming ever more advanced. We therefore need to ensure that we pool all our knowledge in order to also tackle the pirates on land and dismantle their organisation there. We do have the knowledge to locate these pirates before they actually go out and attack ships.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Doing that requires political will and drive, and that is what I urge the Commission to provide. Train land-based Somali forces. Look into the options for targeted action. In the short term, also investigate whether special forces can be deployed in order to tackle the pirates in a very focused way.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This also involves investigating theflows of money and tracing and prosecuting all those who help siphon off the pirates’ money. There is, you see, also an economic interest at stake here – that has been quite rightly pointed out already – and this is definitely also the case for the Netherlands, as a seafaring nation.

As long as this country continues to be the world’s most failed state, as the British Foreign Secretary recently called it, its young people will try to find ways and will find incentives to take to piracy.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, our ships and their crews cannot be left to their fate until such time as the State of Somalia is restored. The reduced forces of EU NAVFOR are not up to the massive job delegated to them and the pirates arrested are not always brought before due judicial process.</p>
      <p sl="el">Certain proposals have been tabled within the framework of the UN in terms of prosecuting pirates and are supported by the IMO.

This must spur us on to call for reinforcement in the fight against this sea piracy, for these attacks are the work of increasingly violent criminal organisations and they are happening more and more often. We must therefore urgently put in place a military framework and, in particular, a legal framework to combat this piracy and ensure the protection of the men and ships, all the while reflecting on how we can put a stop to these unacceptable acts and dismantle this savage piracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I do not understand why Operation Atalanta’s military resources have been reduced and why the Council vote on the extension of this operation has been postponed. I am therefore asking the Commission to urge Member States to efficiently increase this operation’s resources as quickly as possible.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of piracy is not a new one here, and was dealt with by this Parliament in the 2009 resolution. Everyone is aware of the events involving two Italian soldiers, who were arrested for causing the death of two Indian fishermen. In this regard, I welcome the assurances of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, who has said she has been monitoring the case closely in order to bring it to a positive conclusion, and that the incident should be put, to quote her words, ‘into the broader context of international cooperation on counter-piracy and, more specifically, on the issue of regulating the protection aboard ships’.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, the episode forces us to reflect on the fact that the phenomenon of piracy in the Indian Ocean or off the Somali coastline is still an extremely serious problem. As part of its defence and security policy, the EU launched the Atalanta mission in December 2008 and, in the last few days, its extension to 2014 was approved, but the number of ships involved has fallen dramatically, from 35 in 2009 to 10 in 2011. As we know, the EU intends to exercise greater coordination over the naval forces and military personnel on board civilian ships belonging to Member States patrolling the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean.</p>
      <p sl="it">Do we therefore feel that it is useful to establish common rules of engagement? Generally speaking, what other coordinated initiatives does the EU plan to adopt to protect merchant ships from attacks by pirates? In addition, what measures does it intend to take against third countries that fail to safeguard merchant ships crossing between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean?</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, maritime piracy is an increasingly widespread and frequent occurrence today, and it is better organised, more profitable, audacious and violent. No vessel appears to be immune to it, from fishing boats and merchant vessels to yachts and cruise ships. There are 1 500 pirates operating off Somalia. People’s safety and liberty are seriously imperilled, and all maritime and economic activities suffer significant losses, not to mention the costs of rescues, insurance, diversions from routes, chases, etc. In 2012 alone, 22 attacks have been recorded and, just in February, Somali pirates captured 17 vessels and took 251 hostages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In 2009, the Commission organised an intervention at two levels: prevention, deterrence and repression, and also fighting the causes that lead to piracy. However, piracy remains, and is growing, which requires the measures adopted by the Commission and the Member States to be strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Commission must extend its military action beyond 2012 and intensify its diplomatic action to obtain effective collaboration from the third countries in which the pirates take shelter. Member States have to engage both in criminal investigations, in particular, with regard to tracing money paid for ransoms, and legally, in particular, with regard to establishing conditions for putting pirates on trial.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Such concerted action by the Commission and Member States, as well as together with other countries and regions of the world, is urgently needed to restore the safety of the seas, which, in terms of fishing, affects both industrial fleets and small local vessels. The problem affects the European Union economy as well as the subsistence of local communities, aggravating their poverty and leading the population into piracy, in a continuously deepening cycle that has to be stopped once and for all.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the international community is shedding crocodile tears, having abandoned Somalia to its fate for many years by giving up a strong military presence on the ground that would have helped prepare the conditions for governance that could have saved the country, which has now become a thorn in the side of the civilised world.</p>
      <p sl="it">Also shedding crocodile tears are those who protest at the presence of military personnel on board merchant ships and, at the same time, fail to understand that without bringing force to bear, and therefore having the protection of the special forces and using targeted measures against pirates, we will not be able to achieve the result we hope for. Above all, however, the European Union could be shedding crocodile tears if we fail to bring home the Italian soldiers. There is a very simple reason for this: who will be prepared to deploy military personnel unless they can be tried by the correct jurisdiction according to the principles of internal law?</p>
      <p sl="it">It will be the end of action against piracy if the Italian soldiers do not come home. At the very least, we need to save ourselves from the extreme confusion created, not by the High Representative, but by some inaccurate spokespeople who continue to talk about private guards when, in fact, we are dealing with military personnel properly deployed in accordance with international law and in line with our legal principles.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not join my Italian colleagues in asking the EU to intervene to protect the two Italian soldiers because I believe that this should instead be the duty of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as it concerns two European citizens of Italian origin.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unless, in this Chamber and our institutions, we do not make the cultural shift that will require the High Representative for Foreign Affairs to take care of our citizens, especially when international rules have been flouted – the most basic of which is that a ship in international waters is subject to the jurisdiction of the flag it is flying – we will never manage to give Parliament a significant role at international level. This would cause serious damage and continue to leave foreign policy to be implemented by individual Member States, rather than creating the supranational state of Europe that citizens are crying out for.</p>
      <p sl="it">I was amazed when Baroness Ashton initially replied to calls for explanations from Italian fellow Members by saying that, ‘We did not receive any requests from the Italian Government’. Moreover, this evening, you, Commissioner, also introduced the issue saying ‘We are acting at the request of the Italians’. This is the wrong cultural and political approach. We are a great nation, a great continent, and we have to take care of our European citizens regardless of their nationality wherever they are, taking action to safeguard them in accordance with international law. I hope that sooner or later, Baroness Ashton will be capable of making this cultural shift.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in recent years, several Romanian sailors have been captured by Somali pirates. Last October, three of them were fortunately released after eight months of captivity. Piracy should be tackled by the EU in terms of both its causes and impact on security in the region.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Europe needs to change its strategy on Somalia’s political and economic construction by cooperating with the African Union. Efforts must be accompanied by an efficient distribution of humanitarian aid. In parallel, efforts to combat attacks by sea must be centralised. Thus, parallel missions of the EU, China and the US are currently taking place in the coastal area. The military protection of the international transit corridor in the Gulf of Aden should also be prioritised within such a structure.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of maritime piracy is by now well-known, and the sad events involving the two Italian soldiers once again highlights a lack of collaboration between the institutions. If the two riflemen made a mistake in the course of their duties while combating piracy on behalf of Italy, then they will pay, but they will have to be tried by the Italian courts as enshrined in the Treaty of Montego Bay. To this end, I call on the Commission to take practical action to ensure that international law is respected. At the moment, there are two European citizens waiting to understand whether the institutions that represent them will be capable of guaranteeing the rights that Europe talk so much about.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this seems like a film from the past. We had thought that by now, piracy was something that only related to the Internet and issues concerning copyright and similar issues, instead of which, piracy is precisely what we know about from books and films of adventure. Obviously, the modern incarnation involves boarding a ship with machine guns and rocket launchers, not scimitars, and quite honestly, my left-wing friends, it has nothing to do with class war.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is irresponsible to claim that pirates exist because of capitalist exploitation. There are no justifications for attacking, stealing and killing – and to say so means to be complicit in such crimes. It is a tragic problem, and it is even more tragic when the people protecting the ships in accordance with international law are arrested by the authorities of other countries duplicitously in clear violation of international law, as was the case recently with the two Italian soldiers in India, or rather in international waters, who were then taken to harbour in India.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to thank the Commissioner for the comments made this evening in the Chamber, also because I hope that protecting the law is truly one of the EU’s main priorities.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, two Italian citizens, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, are currently under arrest in India. Today, the Italian Defence Minister told us that these soldiers and the ship on which they were serving were brought into port by deceit, having been told there were pirates in the port. Then, once the ship had entered the port, they were forcibly taken off the ship and the two soldiers only disembarked in order to avoid further bloodshed.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the face of such a tale, we want to ask a straightforward question: ‘What is Europe doing about it? Where is Baroness Ashton, and why is she not here today telling us what is happening?’. If her care and attention to the issue are reflected by her absence from the Chamber, then this is very worrying.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Piebalgs, you are here representing Baroness Ashton, so please tell her to come and tell us what action she is taking in this regard as soon as possible, or if and when she returns to this Chamber, she will be welcomed with the politeness and courtesy she will deserve. Parliament sends its strongest and most sincere best wishes to the two Italian marines arrested in India and their families who are suffering hours of worry in Italy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to express my regret that, unfortunately, counter-piracy measures are not producing the expected results. The statistics show that the number of attacks on merchant ships now comes to several hundred per year, and the pirates are still holding over 450 people hostage. Up till now, an important role in the fight against the pirates has been played by the EU and its Operation Atalanta. This is, unfortunately, changing for the worse. The number of vessels taking part in counter-piracy operations is falling drastically. In 2009, 35 vessels were still part of these operations, while in 2011, there were only 10, and now there are only three. In other words, the EU must not appeal to others; it must itself make much greater and more specific efforts in the fight against piracy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we decided to wear these T-shirts to maintain a high level of awareness and to ask the European Union to make a concrete commitment that will be able to successfully resolve the issue of the two Italian soldiers arrested in India. Only by combining forces can we retain hope in the liberation and repatriation of our soldiers. Europe took action unjustifiably late. It is once again absurd to have to note the absence of Baroness Ashton, the person in charge of foreign policy, from this debate. This is yet another demonstration of insensitivity, and here I would like to mention the Lampedusa affair as well, in taking effective and shared decisions rapidly at times of diplomatic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, that was a very emotional debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The accusation that the EU is not supporting the repatriation of the two Italian servicemen is a false accusation. I would mention just a couple of the steps it has taken. The EU has made approaches to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, to the Indian chargé d’affaires in Brussels, and to the Indian Deputy National Security Advisor, and that is not all. Baroness Ashton is fully committed to doing everything we can do from the EU side, but there is no magic wand solution. However, we are fully committed and we will take full care of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Atalanta, this has actually been much more successful than was said; the number of ships in the hands of pirates has been reduced from 20 to eight. While there is still concern over around 200 hostages, there are sufficient resources for this year at least, and good coordination.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the Somalia strategy, it is true that for 20 years, there has not been sufficient international involvement, but the EU alone does not hold the magic key to solving Somalia’s problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, Somalia needs legitimate representatives, and today we have the transitional institutions. They are the only institutions we have in that country, and we should support them because of this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we support – and I mentioned the figures – the security operations. It is not easy to fight Al-Shabaab. Now, the number of African troops that are risking their lives, and taking quite heavy casualties – many soldiers from Burundi and Uganda have lost their lives fighting Al-Shabaab and preserving security – has increased to 17 000, so that might make a difference. However, the fact that a blast was reported at the presidential palace in Mogadishu today shows that the fight to ensure security is not an easy one.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made quite substantial investments in development and humanitarian aid – I have mentioned the figures – and it is true that we are doing more in Somaliland and in Puntland, where the security situation is better. However, it would not be true to say that we are not doing everything in our power. We are actually using all the financial resources that the Member States are prepared to give us.</p>
      <p sl="en">On international shipping, we need the IMO. The IMO has responded to the call we made to it by organising a conference on how to protect merchant shipping. That conference will be held in May.</p>
      <p sl="en">I could go on and on, but my point is that we need to find a solution to the security situation in Somalia and its political development. This is what is needed. The accusations that the EU provoked the crisis are ridiculous. We have not provoked the crisis. We are trying to resolve the crisis, as far as this is in our powers. By the way, last year, there was only one EU vessel taken in Somali waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a lot about alliances. The EU is doing its full share. We are engaging with our international partners. It is very important to understand that the EU’s efforts alone cannot provide a lasting solution to this issue. We need other members of the international community, and the bigger countries, to become fully involved. Only then will we be able to find, step by step, lasting solutions to fully eradicating piracy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Too much has happened in addressing the serious problem of maritime piracy. The most conspicuous area where it is present is in the Indian Ocean. The main pirates come from Puntland, North Somalia. I have always believed that the only way to break this criminal activity is to make it economically not profitable. Indeed, maritime piracy is organised very much like a business venture, with shares taken up by investors who pass on the strategic information to the pirates who are in possession of state-of-the-art technologies. Patrolling such a huge area by navies has had an impact, but the piracy still exists. It has also spread to other areas like the Gulf of Guinea. Today, we are seeing more and more ships being protected by armed guards, the entire ship perimeter defended by razor wire. Gradually, tankers and merchant ships are being turned into sea fortresses. The problem, however, is to turn failed states like Somalia into nations respectful of international law. The UN is not even able to safeguard Mogadishu and therefore, it should delegate the task to those powers that are able and willing to use force to restore the rule of law.</p>
