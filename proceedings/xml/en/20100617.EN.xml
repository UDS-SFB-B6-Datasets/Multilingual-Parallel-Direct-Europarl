      <p sl="en">Madam President, let me thank the European Parliament for recalling the importance of the effective conservation of whales ahead of the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission taking place next week in Agadir, Morocco. The priority issue in relation to this forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission is to find a solution for the future of the IWC.</p>
      <p sl="en">The stated objectives of the IWC are to conserve whales and to manage whaling operations. Following years of over-harvesting, the IWC adopted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Since then, years of unresolved debate over the proper means to conserve, utilise and study whales have made members of the IWC concerned about the bodies of future relevance. Therefore, a process was started to resolve this deadlock situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know the European Union is very committed to the protection of whales and has put in place legislation that ensures a high level of protection in this regard. Commercial whaling is not allowed in the European Union. Based on this strong will to conserve whales, last year the Council adopted a decision on the EU position for the next three annual meetings of the International Whaling Commission. The overarching objective of the decision was, I quote, ‘to ensure an effective, international regulatory framework for the conservation and management of whales guaranteeing a significant improvement in the status of whales in the long term and bringing all whaling operations under the control of the International Whaling Commission’.</p>
      <p sl="en">So the EU calls for effective protection of whales worldwide, and in this respect we still view the IWC as an instrument to achieve this objective at global level. The European Union is encouraged by the current efforts to break the long-standing deadlock within the IWC. However, we cannot accept a final compromise unless this paves the way for a truly effective regulatory framework of the conservation and management of whales, a framework that would guarantee a significant improvement in their status in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling and put all whaling operations under IWC control. The EU is assessing proposals such as the current IWC Chair’s compromise, and Commissioner Potočnik, who is in charge of the assessment, will inform you accordingly in due course. We will also need to maximise the European Union’s influence in the International Whaling Commission. This means ensuring unity in external representation and sincere cooperation among the Member States of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, I can assure you that the European Union will work constructively in the International Whaling Commission – and elsewhere, of course – towards obtaining a good universal agreement for the conservation of whales as highlighted in the resolution of the European Parliament of 2009. With a solid European Union position we can contribute to a constructive solution that will ensure the most effective protection of whales worldwide.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that we are here today in this House under Greek leadership, so to speak, and this subject – the prohibition of whaling – is in good hands with you. However, I would like to point out that, at EU level, we unfortunately have very little competence in these international negotiations and the position that individual Member States have taken has, as yet, not always quite corresponded to what we actually envisage at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have drawn up a lot of resolutions on this subject, and whaling is, of course, prohibited in our waters. However, overall on a global scale the situation is unsatisfactory, as this international agreement provides many opportunities for exemption, and many whaling nations – I would like to mention Japan here – make excessive use of scientific whaling or killing for scientific purposes. That is not the purpose of this agreement. Unfortunately, many inhumane killing methods are also still in use.</p>
      <p sl="de">Overall, therefore, the situation is very unsatisfactory and we ought now to consider what we should do about it. First, we need to consider how we can approach this issue now. It is important for us to act in a united way. In this regard, we call on the European Commission in particular to get the Member States on board and to speak with one voice in the international negotiations, not with 27 as was previously the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need accurate basic data, which have been lacking up to now. We know that whales are a strongly migratory species. We therefore need to collect these data, because there are large differences between the northern and the southern hemispheres. There are also large differences between the individual species. Not all of the species are as endangered as many of them are. Accurate basic data could give us more weight in the negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, we need a clear definition of our goals: What do we actually want? That brings us to the ‘what’, so to speak. Firstly, it is important that we maintain the whaling ban in the EU. Secondly, we should consider how we can promote humane killing methods. That is also a key point, because we will achieve a lot more overall if we have a realistic definition of our goals than if we approach this issue in too naïve a manner. Thirdly, we also need a clear delimitation of the oceans with the establishment of areas in which whaling is absolutely prohibited, but combined with clear controls and a monitoring system that works. As the EU, we can contribute a great deal to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we follow all of this, we will reach a situation in which the agreement might not look as nice on paper, but, in realistic terms, a lot more will be done for the whales.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our group welcomes the statement by the Commission that we will fight to maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling. Now it is up to the Council to confirm this statement and, above all, to ensure that the 27 Member States speak with one voice. We cannot afford to delay this. We know from the meeting of the environment ministers that we do not have agreement here. There are some individual Member States that are pursuing different interests to the vast majority. Now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon, we ought to get used to the fact that we also speak with one voice in our foreign policy and in the representation of our values and interests in international organisations and not, as was the case in the past, each Member State for itself, which ultimately resulted in the weakening of Europe. We have seen this already at the CITES Conference. Here, our lack of agreement was ultimately a kind of powerlessness. We did not achieve what we wanted. I would not like this to continue in the International Whaling Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">2010 is the International Year of Biodiversity; in other words, the protection of ecosystems and threatened animal and plant species will be right at the centre of our efforts during these months. It would be a very bad sign if, in the Whaling Commission of all places, the moratorium was lifted and commercial whaling was permitted once again. We know that this animal species remains vulnerable. Our seas are becoming increasingly polluted and climate change will place yet another new strain on them. We therefore need to be very careful in our approach to this subject. The commercial interests of Japan, Iceland and Norway cannot take precedence here. Protection of this species and its ecosystems must determine our path.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are seeing the abuse of the concept of ‘scientific hunting’. Japan is clearly killing 900 whales a year in the Antarctic Ocean under the concept of ‘scientific whaling’. That is blatant abuse and I fully support the concerns of the Australian Government, which also no longer wants to permit this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should do what the Commission has proposed in this regard. We call on the Council to create unity here so that we will speak with one voice at the forthcoming meeting of the International Whaling Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, if we can imagine a horse having two or three explosive spears stuck in its stomach and being made to pull a butcher’s truck through the streets of London while it pours blood into the gutter we shall have an idea of the method of killing.</p>
      <p sl="en">‘The gunners themselves admit that if whales could scream the industry would stop, for nobody would be able to stand it.’ These are the words of Dr Harry Lillie, a ship’s physician on an Antarctic whaling trip in the 1940s. Recent studies show that it still takes on average between two minutes and over one hour for a harpooned whale to die.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 1982 the world agreed on an international moratorium on the commercial whale hunt because stocks were acutely depleted, and ever since three countries have persisted in continuing the hunt – Japan, Iceland and Norway.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next week the International Whaling Commission will meet in Agadir and the EU has to take a decision on the Chair’s Proposal. I must stress that I am appalled that my own home country, Sweden, has been pushing for this compromise, and I want to bring to your attention the fatal weaknesses of any of the compromises that have been discussed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Any quotas that can be set by the scientific committee must be set in line with a ‘tuning level’. This tuning level is 0.72 and it means that we accept that the stock should be at 72% of its virgin state. It is very important to keep this in mind should we agree to any compromise, and not to go below that tuning level. No hunting should be allowed in the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. Threatened species are included in this compromise. We should not break the principles of protecting threatened species in the UN’s International Year of Biodiversity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, throughout my career as a Member of this House I have been a staunch defender of animal welfare. I have no enthusiasm for whaling, and I would like to see the moratorium on commercial whaling retained for as long as the species, or some of the species, are endangered.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I recognise that for some European countries including Denmark and Iceland – and Iceland is hoping to be a candidate to join our Union shortly – whaling is so much more than a mere commercial activity. It is central to these countries’ identity, culture and heritage. Bull-fighting continues lawfully in the European Union, and this is a so-called sport. At least no one can say that whaling is pursued as a sport.</p>
      <p sl="en">If whaling is to resume officially, or continue for scientific research or so-called scientific research outside of the moratorium, we should at least insist on strict regulation and on the type of whale being hunted, because obviously some are more abundant in the oceans than others, and catch limits must be strictly enforced. We must also insist on whaling vessels using more rapid, more humane and efficient ways of killing that minimise the distress of these magnificent cetaceans.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of a reformist group, the ECR, I am inclined to respect the right of sovereign states to hunt whales for food, although this should not prevent me and others who care about animal welfare from lobbying those countries to stop it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the British public are aggressively against whaling. If Britain’s hands are tied to one harmonised EU abstention on whaling, it will guarantee a return to slaughter.</p>
      <p sl="en">The inhumane Japanese are giving incentives to Third World countries to stop: and look at the return to whaling. It is murder. The Japanese Government should be regarded as socially unacceptable for doing this in a modern world. The British were once heavily involved but have consigned the mistake to a previous century.</p>
      <p sl="en">If the UK is stopped by the EU from voting against this, while the Japanese and others murder these beautiful, sensitive and intelligent mammals, the UK public will vote to leave the EU in uncontrollable anger. It will be the kiss of death for Britain’s membership of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the Commissioner for the promise that the Commission will work towards an effective instrument that would save whales, a better framework and a permanent moratorium.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I think that this is, as mentioned here already, one of the crucial cornerstones in environmental politics and international negotiations where we have to strive for a better united policy within the European Union. The Commission, together with Parliament, should have a better-coordinated position and role in these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to the proposal itself, I really would like to hear strong and affirmative comments by the Commission and the Council that they will take these points up in the negotiations. Firstly, to strongly oppose any moves to legitimise commercial whaling or introduce any new form of whaling: only limited whaling operations should be allowed for indigenous people for subsistence purposes and for local use only.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, to ensure that any whaling has a sound scientific basis and is based on the precautionary principle – haphazard, negotiated quotas are no basis for sustainable whaling; that restrictions on the trading of all whale products are maintained and strengthened; that the reduction in the number of whales taken for non-indigenous purposes from current levels is strengthened and phased out to zero; that scientific whaling outside IVC control comes to an end; and, last but not least, that any additional cost for monitoring, control and enhancement are met by whaling nations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that whales are great symbols of our environmental consciousness and a signal for how we are treating our environment in general. I do not think that any other issues such as human rights would be put aside, to be regarded as an issue of national sovereignty and interest and a matter of cultural taste, and neither should environmental issues or animal welfare. Hunting whales is cruel, it is not necessary for food, and it is threatening our biodiversity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, what the Commissioner said is quite encouraging about the emerging EU position, because the EU will have an important role in the IWC – a quarter of the membership – and with the potential to get allies we could be a major player there. However, I want to clarify a number of points.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam Commissioner, you said that Commissioner Potočnik was studying the Chair’s compromise, but from what I have seen of the compromise it would legitimise commercial whaling in Japan, Norway and Iceland. That, I think, undermines the idea of a moratorium on commercial whaling. It legitimises whaling in an established IWC sanctuary in the Southern Ocean, which was mentioned by my colleague over there, and it would allow whaling to continue involving endangered species. I hope that when we consider the compromise we look very carefully at what the compromise is.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like some clarity on media reports about the Council’s position. The British media are reporting, as one or two colleagues have touched upon, that the Commission lawyers are saying that if they cannot get a consensus in the EU, the 25 Member States must abstain. Could you clarify the exact position and tell us how close we are to having a common position for these crucial negotiations? As MEPS we have all had a letter from the Australian Government looking for support for a progressive position at the IWC.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be a terrible shame if the EU could not find a common position. If we cannot find a common position on whaling, how on earth are we going to find common positions on other major international issues? We already have a problem in the mercury negotiations, and I think we have to resolve these problems in time. It is not good enough to see the EU abstaining like this. It does not do much for our credibility if that is the case. So, please could you clarify that crucial point?</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the so-called compromise proposal that will be tabled next week in Agadir is, in my view, completely unacceptable. A resumption of commercial whaling is something that the majority of the European public will not understand. I call on the Commission and the Member States to speak out at the meeting in Morocco against the reintroduction of commercial whaling.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, on paper the compromise does not, at first sight, look so bad. Its supporters say that it will permit even fewer whales to be hunted than is currently the case. The compromise proposal provides for the introduction of quotas. Let me tell you something from my own experience of quotas in fisheries policy. Quotas, particularly when they apply worldwide, are systematically circumvented. Just look at bluefin tuna. Here quotas are laid down year after year that are systematically exceeded many times over. There is another reason why the European Union should oppose this compromise. It provides for quotas only for those countries that currently – and I would say ‘semi-legally’ – carry out whaling. That would reward the systematic violation of the rules. We should not accept this under any circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="de">Supporters of whaling are hard-nosed in their methods. Japan has allegedly even collected votes from poorer Member States. That is yet another reason why the European Union needs to be united in its rejection of the reintroduction of commercial whaling.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner. I think we, as the EU, have to be strong and robust on maintaining and strengthening the moratorium on commercial whaling. I agree with the Commissioner that we must try and work across the EU and must act together. I am glad that she mentioned the 2009 report by our former colleague Elspeth Attwooll who wrote and worked a lot on the whaling issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to press the Commissioner and the Council on what are our specific red lines. As many colleagues have said, the compromise looks as though it gives a lot away. Will we ensure that the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary is just that, a sanctuary for whales, and will we rigorously defend the moratorium on commercial whaling? For example, will we ensure that the endangered species of Fin and Sei whales are actually absolutely protected? So I am interested in the red lines. Can you highlight those?</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, I am taking this opportunity to say that the Presidency of the European Union supports the working procedure of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), and on behalf of the Member States is working on the mandate adopted in March 2009. Among other important points, this mandate supports the continuation of the moratorium on commercial whale hunting, banning or eliminating scientific hunting outside the IWC regulations, the creation of whale sanctuaries and the continuation of very strict rules to allow aboriginal subsistence hunting.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say that the Presidency approves and supports the process of updating and improving the IWC that is being debated at its 62nd meeting of the IWC in Agadir, with the aim of making it more operative and functional.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Presidency is therefore working, both in Brussels and in Agadir, to coordinate the EU position so that the current mandate can be completed and the policy of protection that many of you also agree with can be clarified and established.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament for their remarks. I would like to thank you because I have understood that all the remarks agree we have to keep the moratorium on commercial whaling, and we will do that.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to try to put all whaling operations under IWC control. I would like here to underline that the IWC is a useful instrument for achieving our objectives at global level, and we should not abandon it.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is working on the IWC Chair’s compromise. I have to say here that we have already received a lot of concerns. Some of them are mentioned here. I am referring to the concerns about the future trade in whale products, the scientific basis of the proposed catch quotas, the financial implications, high catch quotas, the future of scientific whaling and a lot of other concerns.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time we have to try to achieve a common EU position and, as you have already mentioned, the Member States do not all have the same position on this issue. We are going on with the assessment and we are trying to reach a compromise, but I can tell you that we will not accept a compromise unless this paves the way for a truly effective regulatory framework for the conservation and management of whales. We will not accept a compromise that cannot secure this option. We cannot accept a framework that would not guarantee a significant improvement of the status of whales in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards our option and our negotiation effort during the IWC meeting next week, it will be very good, and very important, to have an EU common option. I have reluctantly to remind you what happened with the CITES Conference about bluefin tuna: there was an EU common position and two Member States voted against it. We are going to take measures to provide for this situation, but here the situation is different. We have not reached a common position yet and we have to respect the decision of the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I could not be more sincere about this, I am completely open. Mr Potočnik and DG Environment are still working. They are trying to do their best for the whales and for the future of whales, respecting the Council conclusions, and also trying to form a united EU approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to inform you that we have some problems about taking these decisions because the Council’s Legal Service argues that we have to take this decision unanimously. The Commission does not agree, but this is still in progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is what I can offer you. I am being completely open about this; this is the whole information. We have to discuss more and we are doing our best. Mr Potočnik and the whole Commission are doing our best to save the future of the whale.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Union is obliged to protect biodiversity and conserve species by defending animal welfare and taking action against cruelty in whaling. It is therefore essential that the EU demonstrate in Agadir that it is against abuses in whaling, particularly as regards commercialisation, and above all in so-called whaling for scientific purposes. We know that the quotas are never observed. We cannot, therefore, make any commitments that continue to give countries room to abuse legality.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important for the EU to maximise its presence in the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling by speaking with a single voice. Whales are migratory species, which is why it is so important to control abuses that are committed by the few but which seriously compromise the interests of all. For many coastal communities, the conservation of whales and their habitats is becoming enormously important, both economically and socially, to the undertaking of related activities, such as whale watching. It has a real impact on the sustainability of communities such as those in my home region of the Azores, where they have switched from the historical practice of commercial whaling to this new activity. Courageous positions are therefore required in Agadir.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Global populations of some whale species are now critically endangered, and this is almost entirely due to human activities. No sections of the human population depend for their food on cetaceans. Today there is no justification for the killing of cetaceans: ‘whaling for scientific purposes’, ‘necessary livelihood’ and ‘traditional hunts’ are just excuses to get around the moratorium placed on commercial whale hunting since 1986. Any form of cetacean hunting is highly unethical, inhumane and contrary to the current laws of the European Union, especially Council Directive 92/43/EEC. At the International Whaling Commission talks in Morocco, the EU must therefore make a show of maximum unity and exert its diplomatic influence in order to ensure an effective administrative and legal framework for protecting whales, and uncompromising enforcement, including the use of international diplomatic and legal measures. The EU cannot support a repeal or restriction of the moratorium on commercial whaling. The moratorium should be extended to cover other species of cetacean as well. The existing sea areas where there is a total ban on whaling must be retained and new protected areas must be established. Compliance with the ban on international trading in whale products must be strictly enforced. In the case of Iceland, membership of the EU must be made conditional on putting an end to whaling. Any killing of cetaceans in EU countries must be punished as strictly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 May we in committee unanimously voted in favour of the report on European aquaculture, which is essentially aimed at promoting the sustainable development of the sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to begin by thanking everyone who worked on this report over the last few months, providing me with valuable support. This text was, in fact, drafted over many long months of work, consultation and concerted action, and I hope it will provide the foundation on which to promote a suitable aquaculture policy in a serious, practical and effective manner.

In other words, they have proved that they are indeed aware of the negative consequences caused by the lack of a single regulation on aquaculture, the confusion among operators in the sector, the complex and excessively bureaucratic procedures, the highly discriminatory situations, the market distortions and the low level of competitiveness of European production.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report maintains that there is a need to provide greater impetus to the sector by establishing a specific aquaculture fund that is either independent or part of the European Fisheries Fund, to be used to support research and innovation, to further the virtuous coexistence of sustainability and competitiveness, and to focus serious attention on employment issues.</p>
      <p sl="it">Admittedly, many measures are needed in the short term in order to deal with and resolve all of the problems that currently plague this sector, and they are not easy to implement. I am talking about an integrated maritime development plan, which is essential for making aquaculture facilities in freshwater, sub-coastal and offshore areas compatible with areas for tourism and other activities of financial importance, all within the framework of the regulations on environmental protection. I am talking about the drafting of a regulation that will consider the specific aspects of each type of aquaculture farming, to be introduced above all with the intention of lowering production costs and of guaranteeing environmental protection.</p>
      <p sl="it">From this perspective I believe that the contribution made by both technological innovation and scientific research is crucial. The task will be to actually establish facilities to reduce the dispersion of feed into the water. To this end it will be necessary to increase the utilisation of plant instead of animal proteins without altering the nutritional value of the catch. With regard, more specifically, to scientific research on feed, we will also have to focus on waste and processing scraps to prevent likely imbalances in the maritime system caused by dangerous overfishing for fish feed.</p>
      <p sl="it">The use of the European quality label helps us to compete with products imported from third countries and to meet consumers’ needs and health requirements. Indeed, I believe that it is now crucial that we introduce product certification and supervision of the sector to enable these products to be identified, and adapt the labelling systems accordingly.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last but not least, we need to design facilities that take greater account of the wellbeing of fish, farm density and slaughtering methods. Moreover, these are all measures that should be applied to organic products, too, which are in fact the result of production that is on a smaller scale and less damaging to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="it">The employment aspect must not be underestimated, since the aquaculture sector may also be the best place for fishermen who have lost their jobs.</p>
      <p sl="it">A full vote by Parliament will certainly be the best incentive for the Commission, after its communication and our reasoned opinion, to go beyond the stage of recommendation to the Member States and actually propose the measures needed in order to develop a European policy and to stop Europe being the producer of 1.2 million tonnes of fish and the consumer of over 5.5 million tonnes. Thank you, and excuse me for running over.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the Spanish Presidency would like to thank Parliament for the report drawn up with the aim of giving a new impetus to European aquaculture in view of the need to provide a current response to the needs of a market that is becoming increasingly globalised.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say in this respect that the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in April last year had already pointed out a series of difficulties, but also opportunities, many of which are highlighted once again in this report by the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Presidency agrees with the objectives set out by Parliament, which involve creating a specific Union framework for the aquaculture sector that will enable it to achieve structured development based on sustainability and respect for the environment, on the need for production to have a greater economic value and on providing additional guarantees for consumers.</p>
      <p sl="es">The need to simplify administrative burdens, promoting research and, above all, the importance of a communication strategy to improve the public image of European aquaculture and its products are other issues that should be taken up at European level without any delay. Moreover, all of this should be done within a framework of simplifying regulations and full integration into the future common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report presented by Parliament today is also a wake-up call to the Commission and the Member States, with the aim of achieving a coherent framework and specific proposals to immediately and successfully tackle the problems in the sector</p>
      <p sl="es">I am therefore delighted that Parliament is echoing the main issues reflected in the Council’s conclusions, particularly in relation to simplifying and improving the legislative and administrative framework, supporting research, access to the areas and compliance with the rules in the case of imported products. The Spanish Presidency therefore shares Parliament’s view in asking the Commission to put forward a proposal to consolidate the most relevant rules for the aquaculture sector.</p>

    <intervention id="4-027" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to listen to Members’ views on our communication on a new strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture. I very much welcome the report prepared by Mr Milana and congratulate him for the way in which he has brought together all opinions. I would like to comment briefly on some aspects of this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I appreciate your support for a greater focus on our aquaculture sector. EU aquaculture is at the forefront of sustainable development. Our industry already benefits from the recognition of its assets, its high quality and its environmental sustainability. In close association with stakeholders, the Commission will pursue its efforts to support research and ecological developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, EU aquaculture complements our capture sector and is an integral part of the common fisheries policy, but aquaculture activities depend upon a range of EU policies in areas such as environmental protection, animal health and welfare, consumer protection, trade and research. Mr Milana’s report proposes to include, within a single regulation, all measures which govern the aquaculture sector. So I would like to inform you that I am willing to consider this for measures which fall under my responsibility. For example, promoting species diversity or helping aquaculture enterprises in the framework of the fisheries structural fund. It must be clear, however, that this regulation cannot cover measures which relate to sanitary issues or trade issues or aquaculture products in general.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we should do is to give aquaculture a clearer focus in the context of the ongoing reform of the CFP. However, on governance and better legislation we must recognise that a number of measures to address the aquaculture challenges largely depend on decisions taken by national and local authorities. I fully share your call for streamlining administrative procedures, notably on licensing and for developing special planning. I also fully support setting up national or regional aquaculture programmes to allow EU aquaculture to realise its full potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like also to address some more specific issues which are also raised in Mr Milana’s report. The Commission will continue to ensure environmental protection in its policies and actions. Staying with this issue, we all share the view that the responsible production of fish feed is a prerequisite to sustainable aquaculture. This brings me to fish welfare considerations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is promoting a species dependent approach when evaluating fish welfare in aquaculture. However, I would like to underline that putting into place too detailed rules for the farming, transportation, killing of different species will add much to the legislative and administration burden applicable to EU operators. We need to help the sector organise itself more efficiently and in particular strengthen its producer organisations to better link production forecasts to market needs and ensure higher value for their products through marketing and labelling.</p>
      <p sl="en">Similarly, we will have to define which priorities should enjoy specific EU financial support. No decision has been taken so far but my preference would clearly be for a financial instrument in support of the reformed CFP, in which aquaculture would be given a specific place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Milana, your report contributes relevant and interesting ideas to these considerations. We will continue to involve stakeholders in the development of CFP reform.</p>

      <p sl="nl">I should like to offer the rapporteur sincere thanks for his fine work and for taking on board some of the recommendations of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Nevertheless, as rapporteur for the committee’s opinion, I should like to make some comments, as aquaculture is likely to increase steadily in the future and with it the pressure on humans, animals and the environment. Very strict measures must be taken to protect them, therefore.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Many forms of aquaculture still have negative impacts, such as destruction of habitats, use of chemicals, depletion and salinisation of drinking water and agricultural land, disturbance of biodiversity through the escape of fish, including farmed fish, and the driving of indigenous inhabitants of third countries from the areas where they live for the benefit of industrial aquaculture. Legislation is needed on this. A sustainable certification system is needed for aquaculture products that provides certification in respect of environmental and social effects, food safety, animal welfare and economic and financial aspects, among other things.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I may come across as being rather negative, but I am convinced that aquaculture has a future. We must just ensure that this aquaculture is sustainable and respectful of animal welfare.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating and thanking Mr Milana for his exceptional cooperation and for the integrated proposals which he has presented, bearing in mind the differences of opinion on and perception of the subject. The new enhanced competences of the European Parliament following the application of the Treaty of Lisbon bring with them serious obligations and responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="el">The fact that we are today debating a sector such as aquaculture, which has not been given due attention by the European Union, is extremely important. This sector is trying to find its niche between fisheries, agriculture, ecology, tourism and competition from third countries and, despite that, is doing fairly well.</p>
      <p sl="el">At this point we should mention that, over recent years, the development of this sector has stagnated and the dietary preferences of European citizens are not being adequately met by European fisheries products. Viable aquaculture, with respect for the environment and coastal tourist activities, can satisfy a large proportion of demand, with huge economic, environmental and social benefits.</p>
      <p sl="el">Let us not forget that two-thirds of aquaculture products consumed in Europe come from third countries and are fish of dubious quality which are often produced with no respect for environmental obligations or the health and welfare standards enacted under European legislation. Clearly European aquaculture, which has to comply with a series of rules under labour, environmental and commercial legislation, is subject to unfair competition.</p>
      <p sl="el">This specific report calls on the European Commission to propose a single regulation for uniform management of the sector, given that, according to the experts, a suitable legislative framework for most modern aquaculture technologies can be developed and applied much more easily than in commercial fisheries. Fishermen can do little in relation to fish and therefore focus on improving fishing gear and methods, while aquaculture can improve both the organisms farmed and the farming methods.</p>
      <p sl="el">With production of 1.3 million tonnes in 2007, worth EUR 3 billion and creating approximately 65 000 jobs, the aquaculture sector is an extremely important sector in terms of the competitiveness of and growth in the European Union. We have a chance now to reconsolidate it, so that it sets the standard for viable economic and social development in Europe. It will not be easy, but we must try.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to my fellow Member Mr Milana, who has managed to produce a first-class report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In view of the dramatic overfishing of our seas and the continually growing demand for fish products, alternatives to wild catches are needed now more than ever. However, aquaculture is only an alternative if ecological interests do not get ignored. For me, ecologically-sound aquaculture means, for example, that efforts need to be made to reduce the proportion of fish meal in the feed. Ultimately, we will help our seas very little if we catch 4 kilograms of wild fish in order to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important to avoid a negative impact on surrounding waters. In this regard, much needs to be done in the area of research. At the same time, we must ensure that fish farming does not degenerate into a form of animal cruelty as a result of high stocking densities.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, I would particularly like to stress the fact that we urgently need to establish a maritime development plan. The coexistence of different interests such as aquaculture, fisheries, tourism and, not least, nature conservation must be organised well. All of this has been admirably expressed in our report. Incidentally, a stronger European aquaculture is also valuable from the point of view of employment policy, as it can create jobs in our often disadvantaged coastal regions.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Milana for preparing this comprehensive report for us.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Certainly, there is a great potential to develop aquaculture in Ireland and in Europe. By supporting sustainable development in the aquaculture sector the European Union could help to achieve two important objectives. Firstly, it could add to the security of the Community’s food supply. Secondly, it could support communities on the coast that are highly dependent on fishing and that do not have access to other employment opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="ga">It is accepted that there will be a significant, continuous increase in worldwide demand for seafood, and that wild fish products will not be able to satisfy this demand. It is also accepted that aquaculture could fill the gap between production and demand for fish products. However, Europe is lagging behind in this area; while China – a country where 41% of the world’s aquaculture sector is based – is at the forefront.</p>
      <p sl="ga">This sector is worth EUR 118 million per year in Ireland and it employs more than 2 000 workers. Ireland’s aquaculture sector is the fifth largest in the European Union. In addition, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that production in this sector will increase by 61% by the year 2030.</p>
      <p sl="ga">There is a perception that aquaculture in all its forms has a negative impact on the environment. While I strongly believe that aquaculture production must be carried out to the highest standards, the sector must be allowed to function within the context of an environmentally friendly regime. It is vitally important that the common fisheries policy allows the sector to substantially develop in harmony with existing EU environmental law. As an economic sector aquaculture is stalled within the European Union. Structural support for the aquaculture sector is essential. In conclusion, Madam President, let me say in an Irish context I would support a special programme of incentives designed to promote the development of off-shore, high-energy fish farming and more economic conditions than currently practised.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, thank you very much for the report on aquaculture. We are very pleased that Mr Milana has taken up so many problems in earnest in this report, particularly those dealing with animal health, local environmental problems and the need for an integrated maritime policy. We are especially pleased that the report recognises the problem of farmed piscivorous fish requiring wild fish in order to be reared, and that it states that the EU should prioritise the farming of herbivorous fish.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What we are a little sceptical about in the report is the proposal to introduce a European labelling system – an eco-labelling system – for fish. We believe that neither the individual States nor the EU should operate an eco-labelling system, but that the EU’s environmental legislation should be so good that origin labelling would provide a sufficient guarantee of high environmental and animal-welfare standards. Other types of eco-labelling can certainly be provided on a voluntary or private basis and should promote progress.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I, too, would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for this report, which has been very well prepared. However, I would like to point out that aquaculture is an extremely important factor in employment, particularly in activating coastal areas, as well as in healthy food. It needs to be said that without additional stimulation, by which I mean regionalisation of aquaculture, it has no chance of developing in the respective regions of Europe. I am speaking here, for example, of the Baltic Sea, where aquaculture is a fragmentary phenomenon and there are no opportunities for its development because of the climatic conditions. In Sweden, for example, there are only 200 people employed in aquaculture, and there are even fewer in Poland. Therefore, I draw particular attention to this factor in the common fisheries policy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Milana, aquaculture indisputably constitutes an area of activity with strong potential for contributing to the economic and social development of innumerable regions, especially coastal and rural ones, and for promoting local production and employment. It also encourages other connected activities and so contributes to reducing dependency and to giving various countries and regions more balanced diets. It must be seen as an important complement to the fishing sector, not as an alternative to it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Aquaculture must therefore be deserving of attention and support from the EU. Enough financial resources must be dedicated to this activity to promote it and the social benefits generated by it, specifically by supporting the sector’s small and medium-sized businesses. Nevertheless, we must be careful: since it is an important complement and not an alternative, financial support for aquaculture must not come at the expense of reducing the funds awarded to other sectors, not least those given to fishing by the European Fisheries Fund.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We must also not forget that this activity has a significant environmental impact, which has already been mentioned here. For each case, this impact must be carefully assessed, weighed up and, where applicable, mitigated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Priority must be given to means of production that are environmentally more sustainable, such as organic aquaculture. There is also a need for determined, strong and persistent support for any research and development in the sector that promotes its environmental and economic sustainability and viability. New techniques and methodologies are needed that make it possible to cultivate indigenous species instead of exotic ones, thus diversifying production and reducing risks, as well as to fight diseases and promote the health and welfare of both the cultivated species and consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To this end, amongst other possible instruments, it would be important to reorient the priorities of the Framework Programme for Research, so as to enable adequate coverage of this area of research.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must mention two further issues: certification and quality labels. The procedures are frequently complex, drawn-out and, above all, expensive. If the reason that certification exists is to protect the interests of producers and consumers, then in order to be an effective guarantee of transparency, quality and safety for consumers it must be carried out by public bodies, so as to avoid the profusion of labels and certifications along with the confusion that is inherent to it. Moreover, it must not represent increased costs for producers.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards imported products, international trade must be based on the complementarity of the products bought and sold, and not on competition between production units and producers. The need for imported products to comply with basic public-health and food-safety standards must be kept in mind. All this requires the regulation of trade and a halt to the complete liberalisation and deregulation that we have been witnessing.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, growing demand and fishing equipment that is far too effective have put a number of fish species under threat. A strong European aquaculture is therefore important. We need to export fish instead of importing it. However, aquaculture must be managed in a way that is responsible from the point of view of both the environment and animal welfare. Aquaculture is an extremely polluting activity and destroys the biodiversity of our rivers. At the same time, it is hard on the fish, which grow up with far too little space and are exposed to a lot of medicines. I would therefore urge that we in the EU apply the methods that represent best practice and introduce only minimum requirements, so that countries that want to lay down higher standards have the opportunities to do so. We in Europe can create the framework for an aquaculture that is responsible, sustainable and productive as well as sound from an animal welfare point of view. It will serve as a good example for countries in other parts of the world with a high level of production in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Milana, for his report. It represents a significant milestone in recognising the importance of this sector and its potential for future growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have indicated on a number of occasions in committee, we should not, however, penalise our fishing industry, or indeed the aquaculture sector in Europe, whilst we import so much produce, much of which is produced under much less stringent environmental and social conditions than is expected of the sector here.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the Northern Ireland fishing industry, aquaculture is a small sector with a value of first-sale fish and shellfish in 2008 of GBP 9.6 million. It gives employment to 91 full-time and 56 part-time men and women. Yet these figures hide what we believe has been a success story. The last 10 years have witnessed a significant expansion in this sector, most notably with the production of mussels, which accounts for much of the 8 500 tonnes of shellfish harvested annually in Northern Ireland. Indeed it is a trait of Northern Ireland’s industry that its success with minimal EU interference has attracted investment from other parts of Europe, and particularly from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p sl="en">Opportunities exist for the continuing sustainable development of the aquaculture sector and SMILE, the Sustainable Mariculture in northern Irish Loch Ecosystems, provides shellfish aquaculture carrying capacity predictions for each of the Northern Ireland sea lochs. It is this kind of initiative that lends itself so well to this report on a strategy for Europe’s aquaculture sector and one of the reasons why I am glad to support it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mr Milana on his excellent report. The Committee on Fisheries has proposed this own-initiative report because it is now absolutely vital that we develop European aquaculture, for several reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union accounts for just 2% of world aquaculture production, although it is the primary consumer. The majority of Member States even recorded a decrease in the aquaculture sector between 2001 and 2008, while consumer demand has steadily increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Aquaculture in Europe currently has no specific legislative framework, and therefore no long-term development plan. With better organisation, we can keep consumers informed of the environmental and social traceability of European products, which is not the case with some products from third countries. I am thinking of the Vietnamese Pangasius in particular, a favourite with our friend Mr Stevenson.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are all consumers and we want to be well informed about the health and nutritional quality of what we eat. May I also mention my commitment to an EU eco-label for fishery and aquaculture products. We also need to be able to reduce the European Union’s dependence on imported aquaculture products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you are aware, we currently import 65% of the fishery and aquaculture products consumed on our territory. An organised and responsible European aquaculture sector will enable us not only to create jobs, inform consumers and support the sector within the EU, but also to help supply our Member States with quality products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would add that this report aims to promote a genuine European policy for the sustainable development of aquaculture, and that this development will help to preserve wild species.</p>

      <p sl="es">The spread of aquaculture is important. It is necessary due to the increase in fish consumption and the stagnation of fishing capacity. I do, however, want to highlight the economic importance of fishing, which generates wealth and employment. Health guarantees, sustainability and protecting the marine environment are all important.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to improve the image of aquaculture and also of the scientific and research sector. Aquaculture is an opportunity, as Mr Fragueiro said, within the common fisheries policy, as the Commissioner said. We need to give it a coherent coordination framework; we need to give it the opportunity to bring itself into line, because aquaculture can mean sufficiency, sustainability and economic resources, and I think it is important for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I too add my congratulations that others have shown for the report and for the author’s good work. Can I start by just saying that Scotland is the third largest aquaculture producer in Europe: we account for GBP 350 million per year of annual output, and aquaculture provides employment for 2 000 people throughout Scotland, with a further 2 000 jobs upstream and downstream. But, most importantly of all, aquaculture provides opportunities for employment in remote and island areas around Scotland where no other jobs are available. It is a fundamental part of the rural and island fabric around Scotland, and therefore it has the potential to grow and provide further employment and underpin the vitality and economic prosperity of many small rural and island areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the big challenges for the industry is that it is hidebound by over-regulation and conflicting regulation, in many cases preventing its growth. So I welcome the report’s call for a proposal to consolidate and simplify regulation. But I would make a plea that, in bringing forward the proposals, it genuinely does simplify and genuinely does reduce bureaucracy, and that we do not end up with a situation where we have another layer of regulation on top of what is already there – that actually does not simplify and reduce the framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">One other plea I think we should make is to continue investing in research and development. We need to find a substitute for fishmeal – this is absolutely fundamental for the future of the industry. I also think it is worthwhile encouraging the European Union to invest in the industry, to see its potential growth realised and provide jobs in these areas where there is no other alternative employment available.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Scotland is rightly well known for its production of large quantities of Atlantic salmon. We also farm species of trout and we farm halibut and some Arctic char. In shellfish, too, high-quality oysters and scallops are grown within Scotland. Scotland succeeds at high-quality aquaculture because of our environment and because of our clean waters. They are so well-suited to the activity, and it is self-evident that we must protect that environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aquaculture in Scotland supports many fragile rural and island communities with very substantial numbers of jobs in the processing sector. If we are to develop a new EU strategy – as the report says – for aquaculture, we should be focusing on simplification and streamlining of regulation: I certainly agree with our rapporteur on that. But what we must not do is centralise management and control at European Union level. Let us learn from the mistakes of the CFP. Scotland has its own strategic framework for aquaculture, which should be supported by European Union input, as and where appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is becoming a bit of a Scottish debate, I think! First of all, let me too congratulate Mr Milana for his great cooperation and consultation during the progress of his work. I think it is an excellent report and I really feel that this report heralds a new dawn for European aquaculture. That is also mirrored by the support and enthusiasm for fish farming which we have heard in repeated comments from Commissioner Damanaki herself. So this is good news: it is what we have been demanding for years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Europe used to lead the world in the production of farmed fish but in recent years we have allowed our eye to go off the ball. We have allowed our non-EU competitors to assume dominance in this sector and we have seen our indigenous industry haemorrhage jobs to countries outside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We import over 60% of our seafood needs when we are perfectly capable of producing this food ourselves. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector in the world, and in Europe we have the perfect environment for fish farming: we have an almost limitless coastline with ideal bays, fjords and sea conditions; we lead the world in the science and technology necessary for a thriving aquaculture sector. And yet we are in danger of starving in a land of plenty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Why is this? Well, as we have heard from other speakers, it is because aquaculture has become one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the entire food production industry in Europe, and I am appalled that I have heard speakers this morning calling for even more regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU fish farmers have to deal with over 400 different pieces of regulation, not to mention additional planning and environmental constraints in their own Member States, before they can reel in a single fish, and this is not simply from DG MARE, it is also DG ENVI, DG TRADE, DG CINCO and a host of other agencies. By tying the hands of our fish farmers with red tape we have simply handed a competitive advantage to countries like China, Japan and Vietnam – just look at the vast quantities of low-quality pangasius we import from the Mekong delta, as Mr Cadec said. So I regard Mr Milana’s report as a breakthrough; let us cut the red tape and allow Europe’s fish farmers once again to lead the world in aquaculture.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank my fellow Member Mr Milana for the report on a new impetus for the Strategy for the Sustainable Development of European Aquaculture. As we all know, it is the latest of many reports written on the subject which aim to regulate this sector in Europe. The basis for success will be presentation by the European Commission of a single solution covering not only all categories of products and environmental aspects of the sector, but also budget lines and market principles, including EU quality labelling.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe has a real opportunity to join the world’s leaders in this field. We have the right geographical and hydrological potential, and specialist personnel who are the best in the world. In order to make use of this, however, we need to do some hard work and create uniform EU law covering the aquaculture sector. Now is a good time to do this, because work is in progress on reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Finally, I would like to say that this is a very good report, and I have no reservations concerning its substance. Many important matters are dealt with in the report, and the suggested courses of action for solving the problems are consistent, in the vast majority of matters, with the views of the Polish sector.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I wish to congratulate Mr Milana for this excellent, professional and timely report. This document has been awaited by many people who make their livelihood from fishing. It will reduce the depletion of fish stocks in European waters, while also providing support to the fishery product market.</p>
      <p sl="bg">We call on the European Commission to draft a proposal for a regulation on aquaculture because greater legislative transparency is needed in this sector. Our serious attitude to the development of aquaculture must be conveyed through specific funding from the existing European Fisheries Fund, which will guarantee its priority development. This funding will boost aquaculture production in the European Union, especially in countries recently admitted to the EU, which offer potential, but whose capacity is still inadequately developed and utilised.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally and most importantly, ‘reduce red tape and simplify administrative procedures for using resources’. This is what people in the sector want. It is the condition for the positive development of the aquaculture sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Milana, the rapporteur, on his report. In a world in which fish stocks are becoming smaller and the demand for fish and fish products is rising, aquaculture is becoming more and more important. The report underlines the important role of European aquaculture in satisfying our needs and our demand.</p>
      <p sl="de">The growth in European aquaculture has proven to be insufficient. The Community legal framework is responsible, among other things, for development in the European Union coming to a near standstill since 2001, while the rest of the world has seen considerable growth. The Member States could evidently not be persuaded to model the national and Community legal framework in a way that would allow aquaculture in the EU to be developed in a dynamic way. Bureaucratic obstacles and a substantial administrative burden are the consequences of this legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore call on the Commission to adapt the directives relating to the designated Natura 2000 areas as soon as possible, in such a way as to enable sustainable aquaculture in these areas too, thereby making a positive contribution to their management.</p>
      <p sl="de">A total ban on aquaculture in these areas is unacceptable. There are always complaints about the excessive requirements involved in impact assessments for the establishment of new farms or for the expansion of existing farms. That should not be the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">Furthermore, we can see that the damage caused by the voracious cormorants in many areas is jeopardising the existence of traditional fish ponds. To ensure that this is not also the case in the aquaculture that is still to be developed, we need the European Cormorant Management Plan that we have been calling for for a long time to finally be adopted.</p>
      <p sl="de">My last point concerns aquaculturists in developing countries. These aquaculturists must be made more aware of a policy on quality and higher production standards – particularly as regards environmental protection, hygiene and social standards – in their production.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the opportunity this morning to have this debate because aquaculture has not received enough recognition for its importance. I think it has great opportunities for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The one thing I would also make very clear is that I do not want to see it over-regulated. I think most people have made this clear this morning. Yes, there is a great need to ensure that the environment is protected, because if we do not protect the environment we will not have any aquaculture in any of these areas. That is the bottom line.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not want to see the same mistakes made with aquaculture as we made with the common fisheries policy. Mind you, that particular policy does not leave an awful lot to be desired, and I am not convinced that we need to do this EU-wide. I think we can maybe handle this better with encouragement at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is one of the fastest-growing areas. It is an area that must be encouraged, because many of our coastal regions are under great pressure, and this has great potential to develop. Assistance to that development would be extremely welcome.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this week, both in this House and at the European Council meeting, we are discussing the EU 2020 strategy: a stronger economy, innovation and, primarily, jobs. In my opinion, the Milana report fits in perfectly with this. In the Union, we consume five million tonnes of aquaculture products in total, and only one million tonnes come from the Union itself. This definitely offers opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I can tell from the words of my fellow Members, notably those from Scotland, that there is a very great deal of experience with this. May I contribute one of our experiences in the Netherlands? We have the ‘Blue Port’ project in the Oosterschelde estuary in the Zeeland delta region, where we are working on Zeeland sole. This is an excellent example of investment-heavy research and technological development, and it complies with environmental and public-health standards. There is definitely a sustainable cycle: the fish produces manure, which, in turn, provides feed for algae, glasswort and sea lavender. These constitute feed for shellfish and ragworms and, in turn, the ragworms are used as food for the sole. This way, we achieve a sustainable, closed cycle and new economic activity. If done properly, this can be of great economic importance to coastal regions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Europe has a very great deal of know-how, but this fundamental know-how is not being shared quickly enough, and so I advocate intensive cooperation between the new initiatives and research and development. We have programmes for this. I would draw attention not only to the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) but also to the regional programmes and decentralised cofinancing. To reiterate, this has my wholehearted support. It is possible for us to catch up in this regard. I should like to make one more remark. If we establish a regulation, it should merely provide an outline rather than creating further red tape.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Martín Fragueiro, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, Europe has a huge shortage of aquaculture products, is subject to growing competition from third countries and has enormous, untapped potential for production. With this report, which I am sure will receive broad support from all parts of this House, the European Parliament is sending the Commission a clear message on the issues that are pivotal for aquaculture, which must be worthy of particular emphasis in the future common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore congratulate my colleague, Mr Milana, on his report’s important contribution to putting the issue of aquaculture on the European political agenda at an opportune time. I therefore unreservedly support his report and would urge the Commission to take due note of its principal recommendations. In particular, I would urge the Commission to note the need to give the future common fisheries policy a single, harmonised legislative framework; to establish criteria and requirements that are clear from an environmental point of view; to reduce bureaucratic obstacles to the licensing of new fish farms; to intensify monitoring activities as a guarantee that environmental and product quality standards are being met; and to provide suitable financial incentives from the European Fisheries Fund to cover the increased investment required by innovation and the high technology used in the sector.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I welcome the subject of this timely report, and warmly congratulate the rapporteur on carrying out such a comprehensive study. Aquaculture must be taken up as a European priority, for the following reasons.</p>
      <p sl="pt">First, the majority of fish stocks are overexploited and aquaculture can play a significant part in overcoming shortages of fish on the European market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Second, at global level the agri-food industry has grown 7.6% in recent decades, while in Europe it has grown only 0.5%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Third, the European Union imports two thirds of what it consumes, but its aquacultural production represents only 2% of world production.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Fourth, aquaculture represents a business worth more than EUR 3.5 million, employing more than 65 000 people.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is therefore important to re-launch aquaculture in Europe, correcting the errors of the past. This makes it necessary to invest more in technological research and development, in better land use planning of coastal areas and river basins, in species of greater economic interest and high nutritional value, and in production systems with lower environmental impact, in particular off-shore systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is important to rethink the future of aquaculture when the reform of the common fisheries policy is being debated, increasing support for it and committing to the specific training of professionals and making producers aware of the need for a policy of quality and higher production standards.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Fisheries certainly play an important role in the European economy. In fact, investment in traditional fisheries is vital to the economic development of rural areas. However, I wish to highlight a few issues which, in my view, have not featured in this report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">First of all, we see in the aquaculture sector the same developments which also appear in other sectors concerning the distribution of incomes across the food supply chain. The prices offered to producers from traditional fisheries are incomparably lower than those charged in stores, which is an obstacle preventing the sustainable development of European aquaculture, the topic we are debating today. I believe that this issue will have to be considered and will have to feature in the debates we have on this topic in future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, aquaculture is now a fully recognised part not just of the fisheries sector but of our food industry as a whole and I think it is vitally important that environmental sustainability should be our watch-word.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have to say I disagree with what Mr Stevenson said about regulation because I think part of the reason improvements were made and quality was retained was because of some of the rules that we actually introduced.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I think, for the future of the aquaculture industry, research and development is absolutely pivotal and I would like to ask the Commission to go a little further on what opportunities are available in the new Framework Programme, and to look at the technological developments where we can support our aquaculture industry, because quality has to be our watch-word.</p>
      <p sl="en">And on third-country issues, I think mandatory country-of-origin labelling is absolutely essential.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, it is very important for us to have this debate in Parliament on the future of aquaculture and, of course, in so doing for us also to see Europe as a large consumer market. With a population of 500 million, we consume 10 million tonnes of fish and fish products and, from our own resources – whether from fisheries or aquaculture – we are, unfortunately, only able to produce two million tonnes ourselves. That means that we import a massive amount, and we need clear standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, we also need to ensure that we keep the natural world in equilibrium. Many speakers have already mentioned the fact that Natura 2000 and surely also the conservation of species play a crucial role in this regard. However, species conservation is of course also based on what, in a state of biological equilibrium, forms the ultimate source of food for the fish in the food chain. The cormorant is crucial in this context.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make the sincere request that we also discuss this problem together in Parliament. The Cormorant Management Plan is essential. We have a reserve of one million tonnes of fish, which is being devoured by cormorants and grey seals as well as common seals. These are reserves. We need to protect our aquaculture. It was very interesting when the regions from all 27 Member States took the floor. You were also there, Mrs Damanaki, but that is another topic. We need to agree on how we will get to grips with this problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that the European Parliament is promoting the sustainable development of aquaculture and drawing attention to its importance is very much to be welcomed. In order to enable the successful development of a competitive aquaculture, the right framework conditions are needed for the companies in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">The optimum preconditions for producers lie in uniform and transparent legislation and, for product quality criteria, in access to technologies and research. An intact, financially viable and modern aquaculture is very important for the development of many coastal zones, but also of rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">The breeding of aquatic organisms has a long and great tradition in Europe, and it is associated with a great many jobs and a large store of specialist knowledge. Retaining and safeguarding this for the future is also for me, as an Austrian, a major concern in the area of pond fish culture and fish farming. Pond fish culture and fish farming are already subject to high standards and environmental requirements in a great many Member States. It is important to support and to appropriately reward this quality. I would ask you to include this area in your implementation strategy.</p>

      <p sl="de">We need the sustainable development of this aquaculture for two reasons, which have already been mentioned several times today: firstly because we want European citizens to eat healthily, and for this we need healthy food from a healthy environment.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, fish stocks are to be saved through aquaculture – if we are to believe that. If we consider the fact that the feed very often consists of previously caught fish and often the fry are taken from wild stocks, then, on the contrary, we cannot help but get the impression that the pressure on free-living fish stocks could be increased further as a result. If we add the fact that feed residues, faeces and the antibiotics used in breeding the fish will heavily pollute the waters, it becomes clear that aquaculture can be a truly environmentally friendly alternative only if there are clear standards.</p>
      <p sl="de">Maritime intensive farming and cultivated fish farming must not drive out the indigenous species, nor must it be the case that while foreign investors gain high profits, the residents of the region concerned lose their livelihoods. Worldwide there are a good 170 million jobs connected to the fisheries industry, as we know. We should take heed from the example of Somalia. Overfishing there has robbed the residents of their livelihoods in extensive areas and driven them to piracy. That is not something that we should be aiming for.</p>

    <intervention id="4-058" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, this was really a constructive and very fruitful discussion, with so many interventions from so many Member States. So let me continue in Greek, because I would not like to affirm that this is a Scottish debate.</p>
      <p sl="el">I think that we really do need to agree – and I agree with everyone who has supported this view – that we need to do more for aquaculture. We need to do more because, at this time, when there is an increased demand for fish and, at the same time, there is an increase in imports and the whole situation in terms of overfishing in our seas, we must take a serious stand on aquaculture.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course we are talking about aquaculture that respects sustainability and proper treatment of animals. So my thought and my intention, in agreement with most of the speakers, is for us to set up an aquaculture fund within the framework of the CFP Reform.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I mean a fund that will provide a general framework. I agree with everyone who said that what we need is simple legislation, not heavy burdens with detailed reports which will do more to slow down and hamper the development of aquaculture. I mean a general, single framework. I intend to follow the line taken in Mr Milana’s report, so that we have, if possible, at least within the framework of my competence, a unified framework for aquaculture and a separate funding line. These are the two basics that I want.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, I cannot cover the competences of other directorates, just as the other directorates are not covered in legislation on other types of issues. A particular funding line will mainly help to fund research both into biodiversity and the introduction of new species and into maintaining sustainability, so that aquaculture really is compatible with the environment. Numerous steps have been taken in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, as far as the issues of labelling and eco-labelling and certification are concerned, we are trying to respect what is already happening. We shall simply lay down certain specifications, on the basis of which the labels and ecolabels which exist in numerous countries will be compatible with the European acquis. On a more general note, I should like to assure you that we shall respect what the Member States and regions are doing in this sector. We have no intention of intervening in these matters.</p>
      <p sl="el">As regards the call for a European plan to deal with the problem of birds of prey, especially cormorants, I understand the need for us to be more coordinated on this issue, but it is very difficult for us to make a proposal at the moment. I must tell you that there are huge disagreements between the Member States as to how we can handle this issue and we must continue to work on this.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate and for your positive comments on this document, which has all the same enjoyed widespread support over the last few months.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, you have a historic opportunity. In 2001 Parliament discussed this same subject and published a communication, but there has been no follow-up. However, today I believe that the time is ripe. Since 2001 world aquaculture production has increased by 6% while European production has barely increased by 0.8%. Indeed, with such a broad consensus – which I believe will result in a majority vote by this House in an hour or so – you have the real possibility to put our work to good use. What is more, the Council has also encouraged you in this direction by fully endorsing the stance that Parliament is taking.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe, therefore, that this occasion must be fully taken advantage of in two ways. I would have liked to have said this to Mr Stevenson, who is no longer here: delegislation and simplification absolutely do not mean lowering the level of guarantees for operators and consumers. Often, delegislation can mean making the guarantees clearer for both consumers and producers. Therefore we need to make an effort along these lines.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is only one point on which I too disagree slightly. I believe that you are too resigned to matters to challenge the European framework surrounding the powers of the Directorates-General. Have the courage to do so, Commissioner. Have the courage to do so, because simplification in the interests of Member States and European citizens only helps to strengthen European integration. If there is one thing that is clear to me, it is the specific point that Parliament is making to you today: that one should not always be restricted with regard to the powers of the Directorates-General. There is someone who assigns those powers, I therefore ask you to reflect on them too. This does not mean taking away a duty or function from the authority supervising the environment. It does not mean taking away a function from the authority supervising consumer protection. It means having a Europe in which these functions are fully integrated. That is basically the sole aim of the single regulation: to streamline the regulations in order to make them simpler and more practical for operators.</p>
      <p sl="it">I have one last comment. After the speech this morning I am tempted to go on holiday to Scotland, and I may just consider doing that, but I would not be against Greece either, if I could change your mind there about the last few points which divide us.</p>

      <p sl="ro">A strong aquaculture sector could promote the development of coastal regions, remote and rural areas in Member States. At the same time, it could help develop local production which, at the moment, is at a much lower level than consumption, thereby necessitating huge volumes of imports from third countries to meet the ever-rising demand. I think that we must support research and development efforts in this area and allocate appropriate resources for aquaculture projects in order to continue developing the knowledge base required to promote sustainable, competitive practices.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, particular attention must be focused on the investments made and support given to the businesses in this sector. This will allow us to successfully promote economic activity and employment, while also complying with environmental good practice.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report (A7-0119/2010) by Mr Romeva i Rueda, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a catch documentation programme for bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and amending Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003 (COM (2009)0406 – C7-0142/2009 – 2009/0116(COD)).</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, at this stage I do not think that anyone is unaware – it is no longer a secret – that the value of this animal is extremely high, particularly in some markets such as the Asian ones. In fact it is so highly prized that some operators have been cheating and continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="es">Each year the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) adopts ever more complex and restrictive management measures: recovery plans, documentation schemes and vessel capacity restrictions, and every year the European Commission claims success at ICCAT, that finally the organisation has taken the necessary steps to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of bluefin tuna, and that the situation is under control.</p>
      <p sl="es">Time goes by, however, and the measures that are supposedly meant to ensure the conservation or at least the recovery of bluefin tuna either do not come, or come too late and are insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">The premature closure of the purse seine season only a few days ago due to the fact that the EU quota had been almost exhausted demonstrates that there is still a problem of excess capacity in Europe, which is a huge threat to the survival of the species.</p>
      <p sl="es">The stocks are not showing the necessary signs of medium-term recovery, in fact the signs are quite the opposite. The depleted status of both stocks of bluefin is well known. The spawning biomass of both stocks has been reduced to less than 15% of the unfished biomass. The combination of this with the very high prices paid for the fish, whether it is caught legally or not, and the obvious difficulties in controlling fishing activities and trade mean that the efforts of ICCAT over the past 20 years are at best insufficient.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now we need some brave decisions, some of which will be drastic and certainly painful, but it is essential to have a vision for the future and more than ever to apply the precautionary principle, which has been so absent from the management of this fishery so far.</p>
      <p sl="es">The report that we are voting on today is one more measure that is undoubtedly essential and necessary, but insufficient nonetheless. The aim of this new legislation, which I am pleased to have been able to agree with the various institutions, is to combat illegal fishing of bluefin tuna and improve the monitoring of stocks. The system establishes that every lot of tuna must be accompanied by the required documentation at every stage, from the time it is caught, including landing, transhipping, caging, harvesting, importing, exporting and re-exporting.</p>
      <p sl="es">The documentation must be validated at each stage by the authorities of the competent State: the flag, trap or cage State and includes a wide range of information such as catch data, information on the exporter or seller, transhipment information, farm details, harvest information and finally trade information.</p>
      <p sl="es">Following the frustration experienced by many people, myself included, regarding the fact that at its last meeting the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) did not include bluefin tuna on its list of threatened species, the ball is now back in ICCAT’s court. In November we have a fresh opportunity in Paris to see how decisive the situation is, and above all to assume that there is no time for more delays, legal trickery or falsely optimistic discourse. In Paris we will see whether this time the contracting parties – of which the European Union is one – are really strictly and scrupulously committed to the scientific recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am aware of your personal commitment, Commissioner Damanaki, and you will have our full support to back that position. This is the only opportunity that we have to genuinely and seriously make progress on solving this problem, because if we do not we will have a more drastic and tougher opportunity later to put the issue back on the CITES table.</p>
      <p sl="es">The next meeting will be in 2013, and we should not forget that in ICCAT in November we did not achieve the necessary solutions and compromise. CITES will continue to be and must be another door that we should knock on when the time is right.</p>

    <intervention id="4-067" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Juan Carlos Martín Fragueiro" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would first of all like to stress the importance that the Spanish Presidency attaches to the presentation of this proposal for a regulation for your formal agreement in this plenary session of Parliament. There are two reasons for this which I will now set out.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, this Council regulation establishing a catch documentation programme for bluefin tuna and amending Regulation (EC) No 1984/2003 incorporates the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendations 07-10 and 08-12 establishing the catch documentation programme for bluefin tuna, and in particular ICCAT Recommendation 09-11, which was adopted at the last meeting held in November last year in Recife and has been in force since 1 June.</p>
      <p sl="es">All of these recommendations consider catch documentation to be a key and vital element for correctly identifying and fully monitoring catches of bluefin tuna. It ensures traceability of catches and guarantees that the tuna that is being consumed comes from controlled catches that are conducted under conditions that will ensure its sustainability, and under the measures established in the recovery plan adopted for this species.</p>
      <p sl="es">This control scheme means in practice that at each stage of the chain every lot of bluefin tuna must be accompanied by catch documentation that is duly validated by the authorities of the flag State of the fishing vessel, irrespective of the method, trap or farm. This new proposal also enhances it by taking into account all activities relating to the catching or fattening of bluefin tuna. This means that it covers all the possible scenarios and situations in order to avoid loopholes through which the least responsible actions could evade controls and endanger the efforts that we are making for the recovery of bluefin tuna.</p>
      <p sl="es">The catch documentation will therefore mean that all sales of bluefin tuna can be monitored from the moment it is caught until it is served, providing a guarantee that the tuna was caught under the control and supervision of the competent authorities of the flag State. The documentation is therefore an extremely important tool for controlling bluefin tuna fishing and combating illegal and unregulated fishing.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say that this improvement in traceability in bluefin tuna fishing will also have a clear effect on the scientific evaluation of the stocks, given that we will have higher-quality information on this fishery, which will result in more certain and more reliable scientific assessments of its status.</p>
      <p sl="es">Aside from the importance of this regulation for improving the tools for controlling bluefin tuna fishing, the Spanish Presidency is also satisfied that it has been possible to reach an agreement on this regulation at first reading. This demonstrates the interest and the will of both institutions – the Council and Parliament – to move forward with legislative proposals on fisheries as quickly as possible. The adoption of the proposal in plenary, which is scheduled to take place today, will enable its final adoption to take place in the Fisheries Council on 29 June in Luxembourg.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to thank you all for your valuable contributions to achieving this text, and I hope that it will be an example to follow for future proposals that will be adopted using the ordinary legislative procedure derived from the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

    <intervention id="4-068" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Romeva i Rueda, for his work on this report. I am pleased to see the strong support of the Fisheries Committee on this important proposal. The implementation of the ICCAT bluefin tuna catch documentation programme is indeed a key measure to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. I am delighted that the report in particular supports all aspects linked to the practical implementation of the catch documentation which must accompany bluefin tuna products from catch to the trade channel. Inspired by the current practices in other regional fisheries management organisations and custom regulations, this catch documentation scheme can only be efficient if applied to all bluefin tuna products, including processed and farmed products. This will ensure the control of traceability of bluefin tuna fishery products landed, farmed, domestically traded, imported or exported from the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like also to inform you that the Commission agrees with nearly all the amendments proposed, most of them resulting from the trilogue between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. I would once again like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for the report and the Fisheries Committee for the time spent on this important issue. This report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient traceability system for bluefin tuna and an effective fight against IUU activities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and on how easy he made it for all of us to work with him and produce a good report. We should be pleased because for the first time we are going to adopt a report on fisheries under the ordinary legislative procedure, at first reading and with the agreement of all three institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament’s amendments were essentially aimed at incorporating the new recommendations that arose at the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) in 2009, as the Commission’s proposal only included the 2008 recommendations. They were also aimed at clarifying and specifying some definitions and technical specifications in order to ensure that the obligations of all operators and each of the Member States involved in bluefin tuna fishing were crystal clear.</p>
      <p sl="es">The aim is that the origin of all bluefin tuna that comes to EU markets can be identified so that if this cannot be verified its sale can be banned.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the rapporteur acknowledges in his report, we have therefore arrived at the most comprehensive documentation programme in existence for any species. This means that we can send a message of confidence, while acknowledging that the international organisation that governs the management of bluefin tuna is very capable of reacting for itself in terms of monitoring its status and responding to networks for the illegal fishing of a species whose trade has reached a level of complexity that surpasses that of any other species.</p>
      <p sl="es">Despite the criticisms, without the knowledge and experience acquired by ICCAT it is more than doubtful that any other organisation would be able to take the same type of measures as swiftly and with the same knowledge of the facts.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore trust that the entry into force of this regulation will not only help the recovery of the species and the fight against illegal fishing of that species, but also that it will help to reintroduce a minimum level of rationality and objectivity among the public, and especially within some non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the rapporteur said, the ball is back in ICCAT’s court, and I would like to add that it never should have left ICCAT’s court. I say this on behalf of my group.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this is a historic debate. For the first time Parliament is exercising its powers through the ordinary legislative procedure in the field of fisheries, as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. This is particularly significant for those of us who, like me, live in a fishing community or for those who value the fact that this has happened under a Spanish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="es">The full participation of the direct representatives of the public in the legislative process strengthens the democratic life of the Union and increases Europe’s legitimacy, quality and effectiveness, as well as its fisheries policy. This legislative procedure affects bluefin tuna, a species whose biological situation is a cause for concern because it is in danger of extinction and therefore deserves to be a priority.</p>
      <p sl="es">The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas is the regional organisation responsible for organising fisheries. Its measures, which are based on scientific reports on the state of the resources, should help the recovery and sustainability of tuna. The provisions that we are adopting today incorporate its recommendations on catch documentation. This is an essential element for protecting and managing resources, and ensuring that they are effective.</p>
      <p sl="es">Guaranteeing traceability, from catching to the last stage of the trading process, is essential for combating illegal fishing and sales, and consequently for promoting sustainable fishing and responsible trade. Its application will enable better, stricter monitoring by the European Union. The international commitments have been incorporated faithfully, with no changes to distort them.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, to enable future adaptations to be incorporated in a dynamic way, the new possibilities of the Treaty of Lisbon have been used to delegate powers to the Commission to implement new conservation measures. I am therefore satisfied with the result.</p>
      <p sl="es">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Romeva, and the other Members with whom I jointly signed the text that will be put to the vote today.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the rest of the groups, the Council and the Commission for the agreement that we have reached at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">This regulation, improved by the amendments tabled by the various parliamentary groups, transposes all the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas into EU legislation.</p>
      <p sl="es">It involves establishing a stricter certification system so that we can improve monitoring of catches of bluefin tuna, eliminate illegal fishing, and improve the quality and potential of statistics, which are so necessary for that monitoring.</p>
      <p sl="es">It aims to control the monitoring of the product from when it is caught to when it is sold: in other words its traceability. This measure is needed in order to provide greater protection for bluefin tuna, taking into account the recovery plans for the species, and also better protection, considering the situation that we are in at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to point out that this is the first time that Parliament has used its decision-making powers since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. I hope that it will not be the last time given the bad experience we have had with other matters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I agree with the content and conclusions in the report by my colleague and friend Mr Romeva i Rueda, and I welcome the collective work that has been done on this report. The report is based on a reality that is now unavoidable. Bluefin tuna is under threat of extinction as a species, and many fishermen, an important economic sector and a vital food resource for mankind are at risk along with it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to emphasise what this situation will really mean and the shock it will cause in relation to the period in which we currently live. For it is indeed a shock. For the first time, there is a clear threat to a major consumer product that is known to all, available on supermarket shelves and consumed by us all. It is a clear signal: the sign of a change of era. Protecting bluefin tuna is now a major early warning sign from the environment, and the significance of that warning goes far beyond the single issue of bluefin tuna.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The threat to fish stocks and their much-needed protection are now the symbol of humanity’s entry into a new era of scarce resources: fish resources, food resources and energy resources. The key words should no longer be waste, overproduction and overconsumption, but saving, sharing and caution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for this report. It is an extremely important one, because correct documentation of catches is the foundation of scientific research, and scientific research is mainly what this is about, because it determines the state of stocks and is the basis for realisation of the common fisheries policy. Without the right research there is no basis for proper realisation of the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like, here, to mention other species. Only a few years ago, cod was extremely scarce in the Baltic. It turns out, today, that the Commission is voting for the limits to be increased. Does this mean our programmes are very good, or that we have less-than-perfect scientific research? I would like to make an earnest request for an increase in funds, and also for greater efforts to be made for scientific research to be given a greater chance and be universally applied in all waters.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, on behalf of my group I would also like to join in congratulating and thanking Mr Romeva for this report, which does indeed highlight the need to protect tuna. If I am not mistaken only 15% of bluefin tuna stocks remain.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament has been working for many years to prevent the disappearance of bluefin tuna and I think it is a symbol. Would you not agree? It is a symbol that has a great deal to do with what is happening in the European Union and what is happening to all of us as Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="es">What happens when the market is not regulated? When the market is not regulated, it rides roughshod over jobs, species and the environment. This is a principle, the consequences of which we unfortunately have to suffer. Workers have to suffer the consequences, as do species, and as does the whole of the planet with climate change. When the market is not regulated, it is clearly insatiable until the resources are exhausted.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why this report, with the cooperation of the Commission and the Council, is very important. What is its purpose? Its purpose is to put an end once and for all to industrial, predatory techniques that do not take into account the need to sustain and maintain the environment and its species. It is not fair for the innocent to pay for the sins of the guilty.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Romeva is already aware of my position regarding the need to not punish traps. I know that traps are an age-old fishing technique that has never endangered tuna, something which Mr Romeva agrees with. Therefore in November in Paris the European Union needs to take seriously all the technical reports and recommendations on catch documentation and traceability so that together we can make work compatible with the environment, which is a fundamental principle that should be part of the EU’s values.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the fact that the bluefin tuna was not included in Appendix I of the CITES Convention makes this proposal extremely important. Of course, this report is not a miracle cure but a necessary tool to save this species. The size of the stocks in our seas is uncertain, but unfortunately it is much smaller than we thought on account of it being fashionable to eat sushi. The result is that catch certificates are falsified so that illegal catches are sold as legal ones. If we want to eat tuna in future, too, we must tighten controls on catches, and I have my doubts about the method just proposed by the Council, as tuna is often caught from smaller boats far away from any form of control.</p>
      <p sl="da">Indeed, what we need are rules on how small the fish that are caught can be. It is not good to catch young fish or fry. The weight limit is 6.4 kg and was adopted in 1974. If a particular stock cannot get to the stage where it can reproduce it will go extinct. Likewise, it is not good to fish during the breeding season because, if we do, we will of course leave no fish for the future. Saving the 2-2.5 m long and around 350 kg adult tuna will not be achieved by adopting this report alone. No, as responsible consumers we should check whether or not the fish we buy and eat as sushi comes from a threatened species. That is clearly not something that we can legislate on here and now, but we can simply urge everyone to be vigilant consumers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done on this report, which is extremely impartial and detailed, without being verbose. I would also like to urge fellow Members to give their backing to this report and support the Commission’s provision for the BCD to be validated by the time the relevant operation is completed – transhipping, landing, caging, harvesting – thereby resulting not only in a rapid validation process, but in the exercising of tighter control over these operations.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, I cannot say that, once the amendments have been made to the BCD regulations, this will put an end to our troubles. In 1992 ICCAT adopted the recommendation on monitoring the trade in bluefin tuna, which turned out, unfortunately, to be a less than effective instrument. In 2007 ICCAT adopted the BCD, a more comprehensive programme which, although it marks a step forward, is not a genuine solution at a time when ICCAT has again been overtaken by a situation, which is confirmed by actual circumstances on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I believe that in future, the Commission’s support for including bluefin tuna in Appendix I, which was a missed opportunity at the CITES Conference in March 2010, ought to become official EU policy as the only and definitive solution for saving this marine species from extinction.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have no doubt that the report we will be adopting shortly is a transposition of the new conservation measures adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) last November in Recife.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, I am pleased with the content of this report, and I congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda on the work he has done on this issue. As he has just told us, the new guidelines establish rules on the traceability of bluefin tuna that is caught, landed, transhipped, unloaded and exported within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also lays down rules on the verification and validation of catch documents and presents an extremely clear example of catch documentation. These rules are highly specific, very strict and do not allow room for debate. I believe this is a significant step forward. I think that, with these obligations, we should achieve the necessary transparency with the Commission as regards fish catches, which has not been the case recently.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, it has already been said, but I shall repeat, that this is the first report that has gone to the Committee on Fisheries under the ordinary legislative procedure since the Treaty of Lisbon was ratified. This is obviously a symbolic moment for us members of the Committee on Fisheries, particularly if, as we all hope, the report is adopted at first reading – which I have no doubt will be the case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This speech gives me the opportunity, Commissioner, to mention the recent events that have taken place in the Mediterranean. The abrupt, authoritarian shutdown of bluefin tuna fishing in that area of Europe was an arbitrary decision. The Commission eventually acknowledged that there were 171 tonnes of fish left for French ships to catch.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact that the Commission has decided to reallocate these uncaught fishing lots to small-scale and coastal fishermen is a gesture of appeasement but, in my view, it is by no means a satisfactory answer for tuna purse seiners which, may I remind everyone, employ significant numbers of fishermen, even if, thanks to that decision, it will theoretically be possible to recover the number of catches allowed as a result of the ICCAT agreements made in Recife.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also point out that, at the last meeting, ICCAT – the principles of which are reflected in Mr Romeva i Rueda’s report – took the important and bold decision to reduce catches of bluefin tuna in the Atlantic and Mediterranean by 40% in order to preserve stocks, which is obviously something we all want. It would be too simple to divide public opinion into ‘pro-stocks’ and ‘anti-stocks’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">An assessment by the Food and Agricultural Organisation now says that the species is not endangered. For my part, I am eagerly awaiting the results of the study to be published in October or November in order to have a clear picture of the stock situation and to form a precise opinion. Depending on the results of that study, ICCAT will have to propose measures for managing and preserving the species, and I insist that those measures be respected come what may.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, may I congratulate Mr Romeva i Rueda, who has managed to include the technical provisions resulting directly from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) meeting in Recife, as has already been said, while leaving open the possibility of adding further rules that might arise from forthcoming negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report also includes elements that will enable us to combat the phenomenon of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing, and provides guidelines as regards stock regulation. I particularly support the report.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our vote is taking place at a fairly fraught time, following the European Commission’s decision last week to close purse seiner bluefin tuna fishing early. While a common ground appears to have been found – and for that I would like to acknowledge the step taken by Commissioner Damanaki, who reached an agreement with France, allocating additional quotas for small-scale and coastal fishing – there is still some doubt over the situation concerning purse seiners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The constraints faced by fishermen are very strict, and it is this kind of uncertainty that we must avoid, for our fishermen have to be sure they have a stable and level playing field. It is this objective of predictability that we will pursue in negotiations on the reform of the common fisheries policy. Predictability and sustainability must go together, particularly as regards decisions necessary for safeguarding stocks and the sector’s long-term future, as well as fishermen’s activity and income in the short term, with the objective being a fisheries sector that respects marine resources.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his excellent report. It is an important report. We have a saying in Dutch that translates as ‘knowledge through measuring’: precise data as the basis for further decisions. Let us not pull the political wool over our eyes, though. We have known for a long time what we have to do. We need to temporarily halt fishing for bluefin tuna.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I witnessed in person the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) debacle in March, where a divided European Union was totally incapable of influencing the end result. Led by Japan, the international community decided against imposing a trade ban on bluefin tuna. The argument was that the place to do that was not CITES but the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). We shall have the opportunity to take it to that arena in Paris in November.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My question to the Commission is as follows. Is Europe committed – as I would be – to achieving a temporary fishing ban, a zero quota, within the framework of ICCAT? Also, is the Commission prepared to adopt that position very quickly? That way, we would avoid repeating the mistake we made with CITES, namely adopting a position only at the very last minute and no longer being in a position to convince the rest of the world of our stance. I should like to put a very specific question to the Commissioner, therefore. When will you be adopting a position for the ICCAT meeting? Will it involve a zero quota and, if so, will you be launching a strong lobby within the international community to make this zero quota a reality?</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I welcome Mr Romeva i Rueda’s report concerning better ways of determining the origin of bluefin tuna and of preventing illegal fishing. I would like to remind you what it costs to monitor the Mediterranean Sea just for the bluefin tuna operation. This year it is EUR 5 million. There are 24 purse seine operators fishing for bluefin tuna. Ninety per cent of the catch is exported to Japan. The record this year for a single fish at Tokyo’s fish auction was over EUR 100 000.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to ask the Commissioner this question. In view of the fact that the three EU institutions have agreed to support the listing of bluefin tuna in Appendix I, that is to say that the 27 Member States agree that this wild fish should be protected, and given that we are also in the midst of an economic crisis, where every public euro should be used in a responsible way, should the EU not stop the fishing and exporting of this general resource as soon as possible until stocks have recovered?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the catch documentation programme adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and confirmed by us today is a step in the right direction, but it comes too late. It must not be the case that we only take drastic measures once stocks of a threatened species are decimated to 6%. Illegal fishing is a particular problem here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I still very much regret the fact that the European Union did not succeed in obtaining a better outcome in the CITES negotiation. The ICCAT and other regional fisheries organisations must act with more foresight in future. It is therefore important that we as the European Parliament get more involved in these bodies to counterbalance the short-sighted national interests. The public interest in the sustainable management of fish stocks is becoming ever greater. It is important to convert this into a responsible policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mrs Damanaki, I can assure you that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will support you in any activity that helps to maintain bluefin tuna stocks and to safeguard the livelihoods of the fishermen.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to highlight two points and also thank Mr Romeva i Rueda for his extraordinary work.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first point is that this is an important occasion because we are adopting a law at first reading for the first time. The second is that this work has a deadline and that deadline, as Mr Romeva i Rueda already stated at the beginning, is the next Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meeting, in four years’ time.</p>
      <p sl="it">If what we have written and will adopt today works, then in four years’ time we will probably not have the problem of inclusion in the CITES. That is my hope. I do not want this so much for the sake of fishermen, but for the sake of tuna. The effectiveness of our action derives from our ability, over the next four years, to apply the regulation that is adopted today and to develop supervision conditions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to say a few words on this aspect. We have an extraordinary Control Agency in Vigo, which does a good job of controlling tuna fishing in the Mediterranean. Yet this agency, which has limited funding and needs greater resources, single-handedly coordinates controls, or rather it offers the individual Member States the possibility to do so. I think we need to take a look at this agency and try to create the conditions to grant it direct responsibility for controls and a greater degree of authority that goes beyond simple coordination. Please excuse me for running over.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate our colleague Mr Romeva i Rueda for his efforts in this report. But despite our efforts and international efforts during the past thirty-five years, stocks of bluefin tuna are now critically low.</p>
      <p sl="en">A large part of the reason is of course illegal fishing, more often than not by vessels which are registered to countries which lack the will or the resources to enforce international agreements. No amount of traceability measures or extra paperwork will address the problem of reducing fish stocks if so many vessels are still operating illegally and with impunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission must therefore put pressure on the EU Member States to end the practice which allows foreign vessels to register easily and operate under their flags. It is of no benefit to Member States to turn a blind eye to illegal fishing. The threat to bluefin tuna and to the biodiversity of our oceans as a whole will continue to grow unless we address this crucial point.</p>

We do not, however, see the positive side, which is the determination of the population and their compliance, which is something that all Member State should be doing. We need to be vigilant about this.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if regulations alone could save bluefin tuna then these should do the job but, as the rapporteur has pointed out, the operators will go to extraordinary lengths to cheat, and I fear that these may not curb them. Has the Commissioner received assurances from Member States that they are taking tough measures to prevent black landings and to prevent the falsification of documents?</p>
      <p sl="en">Can the Commissioner tell us what penalties have been laid down by the Member States in law and whether the courts are actually applying them? Past experience suggests that sometimes these matters go to national courts and they dismiss them as hardly relevant.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Japan has undermined our efforts in CITES, but can the Commissioner tell us whether she has received any undertakings from Japan, the major importer of bluefin tuna, that they will help us protect the species? I fear not, but I would be delighted if she could prove me wrong.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and thank you also for the fact that this debate today has been so exciting.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our group there has rarely been a subject that has polarised us so strongly. We – and I personally – worked hard to try to get the bluefin tuna on the list and to get a trade ban in place. We failed in Doha. It would be nice if, in four years’ time, it was no longer necessary to talk about the fact that between 1957 and 2007 stocks of tuna declined by 75% – sometimes it is claimed to be 80% – but that these measures that are being put in place today will on the one hand provide help to the fishing undertakings affected, the people in the regions, and on the other hand also be instrumental in the bluefin tuna not becoming one of the species that we have to consider to be extinct.</p>
      <p sl="de">I understand everyone who is fighting for jobs – that must be our concern, but at the same time species conservation must not be neglected.</p>

I would like to repeat that this report will help us to have very good catch documentation, and I hope we will use it. I hope it will be a very useful instrument in our effort.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has to give the message that IUU fishing is unacceptable and that this applies to our vessels – to EU vessels – but it also applies to vessels under other flags. I would like to say that we will do all we can to persuade everybody that we have to cooperate in order to avoid this IUU fishing. We can do that. We have weapons and we will use them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the general discussion on the bluefin tuna issue, I would like to say that we have to face the problem as it is now. We already have a scientists’ decision, and we have to respect it, but we also have the ICCAT efforts. We work there, we can use the ICCAT efforts, we can do our best. On behalf of the Commission I can say that you can be sure that we will do our best to protect this species.</p>
      <p sl="en">I understand that you have a very difficult situation here, and we have the very difficult situation because the price of this fish is very high. We are talking about a lot of money in the international market, so it is not an easy battle. What I can say is that we can use all our weapons. I would like to remind you that underestimating our weapons is not the proper way forward. We have the weapons and we are going to use them. I have already used them, and you need only take notice of what my friend Mr Cadec said in his intervention.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I just want to make a few final comments.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly I would like to be very honest and say that this has been what we could call an ‘easy’ report. We began from a basis of consensus from all the groups – which I think should be acknowledged – in that we all agree that there is a control problem and that more control is needed. Above all we agree that we need to be not only much more transparent but also much stricter with those who do not comply with the rules. This is because non-compliance is detrimental firstly to tuna and secondly to those who do the right thing and want to do the right thing.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that this needs to be acknowledged, and I am delighted that it is the case. It has therefore been relatively easy – I would even say very easy – to reach a consensus on Parliament’s report. It was perhaps a little more complex to reach an agreement with the other institutions, but it was possible nonetheless. I am delighted about this: that this document has been transposed and is a benchmark in Europe and – I would say – in the world in terms of marking, traceability and above all transparency, from the point of view of catching activity and the monitoring or sales of bluefin tuna.</p>
      <p sl="es">It will be another thing – and we will see this over the coming months and years if we have the chance – how we view the other measures that are also necessary. It is obvious that we have some very different points of view here. In any case, I think that the next meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas will give us a more detailed picture of how serious the situation is. We agree that the situation is serious; what we do not agree on is how serious it is. That is where there appear to be a few slight differences of opinion. How prepared are we to apply the precautionary principle and how many risks are we prepared to continue taking? Especially given that no one can tell us exactly what the stock situation is. We are therefore all clearly working with probabilities.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is, however, something else that it is important to mention here. I think that what Mr Milana said in relation to the control agency is important. We had the opportunity to visit the agency recently, and there we saw not only how important and vital the work is that they do, but also how essential it is that they have the political support and resources to be able to do their job. I think that it is essential that the governments of the Member States understand the fundamental role that this agency has. We must support its work because it benefits not only tuna and the sector that does things right, but also the environment and provides much greater sustainability than we have now.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore thank all the groups and both the institutions: Commissioner Damanaki and the Council Presidency. We now just need to get to work on applying this report, especially – I stress – given that unfortunately with this report we will have solved part of the problem but not the fundamental problem, and that will require us to have many more discussions and make many more commitments than we have agreed today.</p>

      <p sl="en">As we are all aware, the over-fishing of Bluefin tuna continues to occur despite repeated warnings from international bodies as to the perilous condition of their stocks. Two years ago, scientists at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) recommended an annual fishing quota of 15 000 tonnes. ICCAT instead recommended that 22 000 tonnes should be fished. Despite this, the fishing industry continues to harvest 60 000 tonnes of Bluefin tuna annually. The outcome of this negligent approach is that a species which is labelled as critically endangered is being sold wholesale in supermarkets all over the world. What can the EU do to halt the inevitable slide towards near-extinction for North Atlantic Bluefins? This House could begin by recognising the hollow nature of recommendations coming from the ICCAT – an organisation which ignores the advice of its own scientists and whose own internal audit labelled its fishing policies a ‘travesty of fisheries management’, and an ‘international disgrace’. Instead, this House should recognise the position of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and upgrade the initial support expressed by the EU to official Community policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have high regard for you, and your chairmanship was extremely good during this vote. I would just like to ask one thing of all vice-presidents, and that is to stop wishing everyone a nice weekend during the midday vote on Thursdays. This afternoon we have urgent debates and we have votes. These are fully valid votes, even if many people will already be leaving. I would ask you please not to wish us a nice weekend before the end of the sitting – in other words this afternoon at 17.00.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I consider it extremely regrettable that the work of defenders of human rights is deliberately obstructed in many countries by restrictive laws and administrative barriers, or even completely blocked by arbitrary arrests, imprisonment, persecution and intimidation.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In view of the fact that the European Union acts as a global defender of human rights, I would like to join the call for the Commission to start fully exploiting the new powers acquired through the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon for the purposes of fulfilling EU regulations relating to human rights, and systematically inserting human rights clauses into all partnership and trade agreements between the EU and third countries. I fully agree with the preventative approach, such as the assessment from a human rights perspective of third countries entering into trade relations with the EU, and in my opinion it would also be useful to involve the commercial sector.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mrs Hautala has drafted a very good report, for which I thank her. If the proposals which follow from this report are put into effect, the European Union’s protection of human rights defenders will be significantly strengthened. This is an important and legitimate objective, and this is why I voted for adoption of the report. We have the opportunity to save the lives of many human rights defenders around the world. Let us, therefore, do everything we can so that they do not have to die in defence of the universal values which we endeavour to promote.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, and the Chair of our Committee, Mrs Pack, for her report on players’ agents. This is an excellent start, if we are to speak about agents. I voted in favour of the report.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Throughout Europe, we have to ensure that players’ agents act according to certain ethical rules. At present, unfortunately, in many respects such a code of ethics is missing.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is very important because one of the biggest problems we are facing today is human trafficking. To some extent, and in some regrettable cases, there have been signs that football and other sports clubs have been used as such a tool. We therefore want to ensure that sport is completely unsullied in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I consider this report to be very welcome. I believe that, together with UEFA and FIFA, we can establish a code of practice to implement and follow in order to ensure high ethical standards in sports and the trade in players as well as agency work.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted differently to my group on two amendments: Amendments 1 and 2 tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance as part of our joint motion for a resolution. I supported these amendments because I believe it is of paramount importance, based on the analysis of the summit’s outcome, for us to consider in its entirety the state of human rights in Russia.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the brutal suppression of the demonstration organised to mark the summit reminds us, unfortunately, that respect for the freedom of assembly is far from a reality in Russia. I believe that we need to remind the Russian Federation authorities that they must respect this fundamental political right. In my view, we cannot close our eyes either when a violation of the right to a fair trial is involved. We must emphasise the need to have judicial procedures which are devoid of any political influence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to voice a similar opinion. With regard to the resolution on Russia, I voted for Amendments 1 to 4.</p>
      <p sl="en">It has been said that it was not the business of the EU-Russia summit to address all the human rights programmes, but they are linked, especially when we take into consideration the fact that there were demonstrations in 40 Russian cities on 31 May – that is just before the summit began – asking for freedom of assembly. We should mention this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Even if these questions were not discussed during the summit, I think that thanks to the votes of my group and my own vote in favour of Mrs Hautala’s Amendment 3, we will have a resolution which more fully expresses our views on what is happening in Russia itself, and also in relations between the European Union and Russia. The issues of respect for basic and fundamental rights, the right to assembly and the right of citizens to express their views should remain key issues in our external relations, including, too, our relations with the Russian Federation.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I abstained from the vote on the Israeli attack on the Gaza aid flotilla because the resolution does not condemn in strong enough terms the campaign of violence being carried out by the Israeli army against the people of Palestine in Gaza and on the West Bank.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The murder of nine civil rights workers disgusted people all over the world. It was a case of piracy on international waters. Israel’s rejection of an independent inquiry cannot be accepted; the government of the United States – under President Obama – must also be condemned as it did not denounce the slaughter. One cannot trust the United Nations to respond to the problems of the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="ga">We saw international demonstrations against the attack all over the world. It is important to mention that there was a large parade in Tel Aviv, in which both Palestinians and Israelis took part. And in reality, it is through large-scale movements of workers and poor people in Palestine – as well as in Israel – that a solution can be found to the Middle East question and that a new democratic, socialist society can be established in the Middle East as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the motion for a resolution on the situation in Gaza. However, I feel that the text is not entirely satisfactory. It is certainly important for Parliament to make its voice heard in relation to the events which occurred on 31 May. An inquiry is obviously needed, with credible international involvement, in order to shed light on the events which took place on that date.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is also important for Parliament to demonstrate that it is interested in the humanitarian situation in Gaza, bearing in mind too Israel’s legitimate concerns about its own security. However, I do think that it is paradoxical for us to ask for an inquiry, while also describing the events which took place as a breach of international law, as in point 2. I also have a problem with us talking about ‘collective punishment’, which is the expression used in Recital C.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If the European Union wants to play a role in the Middle East, it is vital for it to be seen as a neutral mediator. In my view, we will not make progress in finding peace by making such statements.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I supported the Gaza resolution. However, I find that, emotionally, it is not very well balanced. While we call for an impartial international inquiry into this incident, we should not rush to conclusions or assessments, and that is why I opposed the second part of paragraph 2, which declares that this was a breach of international law. It is up to the investigators to find that out. I also oppose recital C.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I share the opinion of Mr Kelam. Along with the rest of my group, I voted in favour of this resolution on the attack on the ship.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It has to be said, however, that there were important issues in our own resolution that this resolution ignored. To take one example: the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wanted to recognise Israel’s right to exist within its internationally recognised and secure borders. Since this quite self-evident statement is not in the final resolution, I would like to ask why.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I voted against this resolution because to my mind it is not impartial. Unfortunately, the resolution is too anti-Israeli, and does not look at the overall situation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I think that we, the European Union, also failed inasmuch as we ought to have prevented European Union nationals from getting on those ships, as the objective was obviously just to provoke, to enter a closed-off area where an international sea blockade was in place. We all know what that means under international legislation on sea blockades.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As I watched various television channels, it became apparent that, regrettably, that ship was merely intent on a strike against Israel and raising Hamas’s profile. Given that, there is no way we can stand behind this type of action that supports terrorism; instead we have to stand up for democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion and defend the democratic state of Israel and its right to exist.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, this resolution contained a justified criticism of the Israeli attack, but I regret the fact that the words have not been converted into action. Let us imagine for a moment that it was Cuba or Venezuela or Iran that had attacked an EU vessel in international waters without a prior declaration of war and had killed a number of people – 9 people killed, 34 injured – the reason being that there had been an attempt to support terrorism in Cuba or something along those lines. Would the EU have maintained a privileged trading relationship with such a country? No, of course not. We would have responded in a completely different way. The problem with this resolution is that it contains some fine words, but it will not lead to action. It does not take up the issue of the privileged partnership. If Parliament is to retain its credibility, I think it is important that our words are accompanied by action.</p>

I share the opinion of my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), as well as that of Mr Takkula, that condemning Israel now, and saying that the country has violated international law, before the international commission has said anything, while at the same time making demands of the commission, is pointless and completely divorced from reality. Besides, those who were in the flotilla and who were transporting the goods to Gaza are addressed in the text in one way, while the authorities and citizens of Israel are addressed in another way, which causes unnecessary and unjustified emotion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This European Parliament own-initiative report enables us to evaluate the current situation and propose further steps for the future with regard to the work of human rights defenders around the world. As highlighted in paragraph 7, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon should enable the EU’s presence on the international stage to be strengthened, and aid for human rights defenders to be increased: ‘Expects that the appointment of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is at the same time Vice-President of the Commission, and the creation of a common External Action Service, could considerably enhance the coherence and effectiveness of the EU in this field’. As mentioned in paragraph 32, the representatives of the European Union abroad have a real responsibility and, therefore, real duties to fulfil: ‘Calls on the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and on all Commissioners with responsibilities in the area of External Relations to systematically meet with human rights defenders when they officially travel in third countries’.

      <p sl="lt">I agree with the objectives laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon, whereby each country should appoint a highly qualified political official with a specific responsibility on human rights and democracy. I agree with the initiative to establish a Focal Point which would be responsible for matters related to human rights defenders and the work they carry out. Furthermore, EU Member States need to develop a holistic approach towards human rights defenders in order to increase the credibility and efficiency of EU policy amongst EU Member States. Support measures must be applied to secure their activities, as well as preventive and protection measures, while taking into account both the short-term and the long-term needs of human rights defenders. I would like to stress that human rights defenders in third countries will be better protected by making the EU dialogue with third countries on political and human rights issues more effective. It is also very important for the role of the defender to be known to and supported by society because the recognition and visibility of their work can also help improve protection in difficult circumstances, as perpetrators might refrain from action when abuses will not occur unnoticed.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome this report on EU policies in favour of human rights defenders, who play a priceless role in the advancement of fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law. The Lisbon Treaty places the protection of human rights at the core of the EU's external action. The structure of the External Action Service should therefore reflect this principle, and each EU delegation to a third country needs to include a human rights envoy, to keep contact with independent civil society in a systematic fashion. If EU support for human rights is to remain effective and credible, the protection of human rights defenders has to be present at all levels and instruments of EU foreign policy. EU guidelines on human rights defenders need to be sensitive to especially vulnerable groups, such as women rights defenders, journalists, economic and social rights defenders and those advocating minority and indigenous rights. In its dialogue with third countries, the EU must do its utmost to ensure that their national laws grant the rights enshrined in the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, not only freedom of association, expression and assembly, but also the right to transparently receive domestic and foreign funding.</p>

There are unfortunately innumerable sad news items reporting the murder, mutilation and torture of people whose only crime was to give their lives, their determination and their dedication to the cause of democracy and liberty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union has made the defence of human rights one of the pillars of its foreign policy and it must, therefore, be consistently in the front line of defence of those who are generously fighting on the ground for freer, fairer and safer societies. On this subject, I would recall the case of those to whom the European Parliament has awarded its Sakharov Prize and who are still today deprived of fundamental freedoms, such as the right to travel, to express themselves freely or even to live in freedom. Europeans must not only recognise the importance of the values, rights and freedoms that they have, but must also seek to contribute decisively to enabling those who are trying to make the societies in which they are active adopt those same standards to do so in the greatest possible safety.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I applaud the adoption of this report, which is a pledge to urge the European Union and its Member States to protect and support the defenders of human rights, who play a fundamental role in protecting and promoting basic human rights, often putting their own lives at risk. The EU must strongly support the defence of fundamental rights, the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and democracy. I note that the Treaty of Lisbon, namely Articles 3 and 21, places the promotion and protection of human rights at the centre of the Union’s external action. I therefore believe that promoting human rights, as a fundamental and objective value of the Union’s external policy, should be duly reflected in the European External Action Service. The promotion, protection and safety of the defenders of human rights must be deemed to be a priority in the European Union’s relations with third countries.

The work carried out by human rights defenders is invaluable, but it is not recognised or valued highly enough. In addition, many suffer harassment, threats and violence by oppressive regimes or within their own country, and therefore granting emergency visas is, in my view, a necessary measure to protect these people who are active every single day and risk their lives to promote human rights around the world. Furthermore, it was essential to emphasize the role – too often forgotten – that businesses play in the repression suffered by human rights defenders by providing surveillance technologies to these regimes, and that is what makes this text so commendable. Finally, I hope that Mrs Ashton and all the Commissioners directly or indirectly involved in these issues will take into account the recommendations of this text, by meeting with human rights defenders when they travel to third countries, so that they can benefit from greater visibility.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this proposal, believing that the sustainability of resources is essential, and a good documentary process can be an important contribution to this. In the case of bluefin tuna, taking into account the changes noted from 1974 to 2009, the latest developments discussed at the ICCAT meeting in Recife are a pivotal point and must be included fully in Community law. The high monetary value of this type of catch justifies rigorous monitoring. However, the complexity of it should be noted in the documentation programme. Both of these reasons have led to a growing trend for operators to escape monitoring, rendering it necessary to work within the EU’s INN Regulations and its subsequent measures: bans on imports and the obligation to provide catch certificates. Factors such as the depletion of bluefin tuna, the extremely high prices paid for the fish (whether caught legally or illegally) and the difficulties in controlling fishing activities and business make the measures that are currently in place insufficient for sustainable fishing. We therefore ask the Commission to draft the relevant Community regulatory framework as urgently as possible.</p>

      <p sl="it">Thank you for this opportunity to explain my reasons for voting in favour of the Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that within the European Parliament there is a general consensus on the need to protect species at risk of extinction. Biodiversity is truly the world’s heritage, and Member States and the entire international community must do everything possible to protect it.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this sense we are right to be addressing the bluefin tuna situation. If the bluefin tuna stock is constantly declining, then finding a method to safeguard it must be a priority for us. Therefore, the Bluefin Tuna Catch Documentation Programme, which is proposed in this report and is a measure that implements what has already been approved by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, is a good idea in my view. I believe that this new programme can truly help resolve the problem of the declining numbers of bluefin tuna, even though it will create some difficulties for small-scale European fishermen. This remains one of the employment categories that has been worst hit by the economic crisis and it needs to be supported in other ways.</p>

The preservation of this species is therefore crucial for our country, not only because the livelihoods of innumerable families depend on it, but also because it is a fish that is essential to feeding our population.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, when the rapporteur recalls the possibility of the bluefin’s inclusion in the appendix to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which would prevent it from being traded, I must stress once again the importance of ensuring adequate protection for endangered wild species whilst at the same time not threatening activities that ensure the economic and social viability of various communities or condemning them to disappearance.</p>

The document incorporates the provisions of the ICCAT programme with a view to identifying the origin of all the variants of this species.

      <p sl="es">I voted in favour of this report because it is a step forward in defining the documentation that must accompany catches of bluefin tuna. I believe that these control measures make illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing difficult, therefore they are going in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="es">Bluefin tuna is a symbol of what is happening in the EU: of what happens when the market is not regulated. What happens is that it rides roughshod over jobs, the environment and species such as bluefin tuna. The market is insatiable and it exhausts the resources. The exhaustion of fishing resources is an environmental problem, but also a social one. The innocent cannot pay for the sins of the guilty. Traps, which are an age-old fishing technique that has never endangered the survival of bluefin tuna, cannot be punished.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union must take seriously the technical reports on bluefin tuna that come out of the next meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

      <p sl="it">The proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amends the existing regulation on bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) catch documentation.</p>

This Commission was set up as an organisation to combat unregulated fishing through the use of alternative measures. These included imposing trade measures on countries whose vessels fished for endangered species in breach of ICCAT regulations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The bluefin tuna saga continues. Just as well, I might add, since, despite the firm stance taken by the 27 Member States of the European Union and by the United States – which are in favour of a ban on marketing the species – the call for a ban was blocked in March by Japan, a country that consumes more than 80% of bluefin tuna, and its allies. Yet the facts speak for themselves: 70% of the world’s fisheries are in danger of extinction; we are literally plundering the oceans. That is why the message sent out by the European Parliament today is important: we need greater and better quality control. We need to strengthen the powers of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas which, over the past 20 years, has failed to ensure sustainable fishing and to preserve stocks. The traceability of fish from capture to export must also be improved. Finally, we should welcome the remarks made by Commissioner Damanaki, who said during the debate that the European Commission would use all its legal and diplomatic authority to save bluefin tuna. These are grave times: stocks have depleted by more than 85% since industrial fishing began.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very glad the EP supported my proposal of report on such an important issue. The new Bluefin Catch Document is a welcome and valuable addition to the system slowly being put in place to regulate the bluefin tuna fishery, but by itself, it is not going to save the species from collapse. After many years of over-exploitation, including large catches taken illegally by EU and other fleets, bluefin tuna is severely depleted. Commissioner Damanaki recognized this by supporting a ban on international trade in bluefin earlier this year at CITES, which would have had the effect of significantly reducing catches, bringing them more in line with scientific advice. If the European Union is to be consistent in its policy on bluefin tuna, then it must behave more responsibly at the next meeting of ICCAT, to take place in Paris from 17-27 November. For many years, the EU used its very considerable influence in ICCAT to push for quotas that were far higher than scientific advice, while at the same time not putting in place strict monitoring of the fishery. As a result, quotas were sometimes exceeded.</p>

Recent events have shown that a properly functioning statistical system is essential for obtaining reliable data, given that the political will to comply with common rules and to make real progress towards stronger statistical governance has so far been lacking.

Member States should therefore accept that this European Commission body will validate their calculations, oversee their management and inspect their data. Being granted aid from the Structural Funds could even become conditional on the handing-over of these statistics. This text is in the same vein as the one approved by the Council on 7 June 2010, which would force Member States to have their budgets validated by the Commission.

I would like to draw attention to the fact that the current economic crisis has raised concerns that the achievements in gender equality are at risk, and that the effects of the recession are liable to affect women in particular. It is regrettable that many women have already lost or are expected to lose their jobs, particularly those working in retailing, services and tourism as well as women in part-time and precarious jobs. I would also like to stress that female unemployment can be expected to rise disproportionately as public sector budget cuts are announced, since women are disproportionately employed in education, health and social services. Moreover, given that many women are starting their own businesses, we must strive for a reduction in the administrative burden and create new jobs in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector. Women’s integration into the labour market in recent decades means not only a greater direct impact of the crisis on women themselves but also on households, where incomes will be significantly affected by female job losses.</p>

      <p sl="it">I did not abstain from voting on the report because I do not recognise the social and human importance of women. Rather I abstained because I consider it reductive to allocate responsibility for the current economic crisis to men, because they are of the male gender. In the text submitted in this Chamber today, I also encountered more than a few elements contained in previous documents and already approved by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. I am also convinced that, by their very nature, women are endowed with more pronounced managerial and administrative capacities than we men and in present-day society the roles of effective prestige with which they are entrusted have yet to be acknowledged. Having said this, however, the roots and causes of the economic crisis are quite different and certainly cannot be attributed to the small proportion of women on the boards of directors of banks or rating agencies. One of the most severe consequences of this crisis is the high unemployment rate, which is hitting everyone very alarmingly, particularly young people and women. I believe that the European Union has long been engaged in recognising the role of women in society and the Parliamentary Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is a clear example of this. At the same time, however, I believe that the EU must adopt a very different course of action to ensure women are valued and their true worth is acknowledged.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this report on gender aspects of the economic downturn and financial crisis, which highlights the particularly negative impact of the current economic crisis on women, whose employment status tends to be more precarious, with a higher risk of redundancy and lack of social security coverage. Moreover, 35 years into the implementation of the equal pay directive, the gender pay gap stands at an EU average of 18%, rising as far up as 30% in some Member States. Budgetary cuts are now affecting gender equality measures, work-life reconciliation policies as well as care services for children, the elderly and other dependents. About 95% of decision makers in financial institutions and all central bankers in the EU are men, so women are especially vulnerable to what is a truly man-made crisis. Equal pay legislation at EU level needs to be revised and gender mainstreaming has to be part of the EU 2020 strategy, with specific targets in its employment and macro-economic guidelines. Gender budgeting should be introduced in all policies. We need quality care services and increased participation of women at all levels of decision making in order to help curb the feminisation of poverty.</p>

      <p sl="pt">However, I must recognise that the States need to make an effort, not only on a legislative, but also on a practical level, to try to reduce the differences that persist between men and women in the work place, setting the same pay for the same job, equal access to positions of responsibility or management and legislating to allow women to have an adequate work-life balance, so that the decision to start a family does not place an excessive burden on her career.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the current scenario of the world economic crisis that has been aggravating the social problem, the risk of gender discrimination is a real threat to the consolidation of a developed, fair and equitable Europe. Sexual discrimination is a structural problem that exists in the developed world and in Europe and has serious consequences in terms of equal opportunities and economic and social stability. I understand that the irreplaceable and essential role of women in a family and social context is not duly recognised, valued or protected. The weaker position of women is even more evident in the unacceptable wage discrimination and in terms of access and progress in the workplace, in the private or public sector and even in politics. The European Union should be determined to defend equal opportunities based on valuing professional skills and merit, regardless of gender or colour. However, I regret that this noble cause is exploited to promote various issues that give rise to fundamental differences in their ethical and moral contextualisation, as in the case of abortion and the incentives from the State and regional authorities on this matter.

      <p sl="de">Women are under-represented on the boards of companies in the financial sector. The proportion of women directors is far too small. In the opinion of the report’s author, a better gender balance could possibly have prevented the credit crisis from occurring or at least significantly reduced its impact. According to Michel Ferrary, professor at Ceram in France, women tend to avoid risk and focus more on a long-term perspective. Although I am sceptical about studies of this kind, we must ensure that the proportion of women increases significantly in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">Women are being harder hit by the crisis than men, as cuts in public spending affect them more directly, in particular in the area of domestic care and motherhood.

The people are watching Parliament; they are looking at what we have actually done for them. The targets we have set are on the right scale of values, and now we must make sure that the decisions made by the Member States are also implemented. It is no secret that today, the serious economic and financial crisis in Europe is having a particularly harmful effect on women, because the crisis is further deepening the current problems that exist in the area of gender mainstreaming, such as inequality and discrimination. As we attempt to resolve the crisis, without doubt one of the main objectives in the new economic environment is to increase the sustainability of the EU’s competitiveness – and not only that, but also to increase competitiveness itself. However, when taking action to boost the EU’s competitiveness, we should not forget the fact that equal rights between men and women are not an objective in itself, but a precondition for the EU’s overall objectives – growth, employment and achievement of social cohesion. On this point, though, it worries me that in the EU 2020 strategy, which sets out Europe’s strategic objectives for the next ten years, the gender aspect is lacking in the measures which are soon to be fully outlined. I agree with the point made in the report that equal treatment of women and men is one of the European Union’s values, and it must also be one of the central principles in any political measures taken in reaction to the economic and financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="es">With the adoption of the report on gender aspects of the economic recession and the financial crisis, the EP is ensuring that today will become very important for many millions of women in Europe, because for the first time since the crisis became apparent it is being discussed from a gender perspective. I am pleased that once again it has been the European Parliament that has led the way for the other institutions, in this case, with an own-initiative report that finally includes gender issues in the debate about overcoming the economic crisis. This report shows that gender inequalities are among the causes and consequences of the financial and economic crisis. To begin with, the composition of the decision making bodies of financial institutions is clearly imbalanced. At European level, its three financial institutions (the European Central Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund) are led by men, with only 10% of women present in their higher decision-making bodies. This has generally led to a culture of risk taking with catastrophic consequences.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report because I believe that equality between men and women is an essential requirement for the full enjoyment of fundamental human rights. We should also highlight that, since this is a fundamental principle of the European Union, it is high time to make a real effort in terms of ending existing discrimination between the sexes. However, gender equality is a pivotal instrument for economic development and social cohesion, as it has an unquestionable impact on productivity and economic growth, bringing with it countless social and economic benefits. This being so, and taking into account the complex current crisis, it is essential to seek mechanisms for including women in society. Actions on this scale are therefore extremely useful as they have a positive impact in terms of full inclusion of women in the workplace and in society in general.</p>
      <p sl="pt">To this end, I believe that this report makes an essential contribution in terms of discrimination against women and overcoming serious obstacles relating to gender equality.

      <p sl="fr">The report by Mrs Figueiredo is an own-initiative report on the assessment of the 2006-2010 Road map for Equality between men and women. This road map identifies six priority areas for action in order to bring about greater gender equality: strengthening the economic independence of women; reconciliation of private and professional life; equality of gender representation in decision-making positions; eradicating violence against women; eradicating gender stereotypes; and promoting gender equality in third countries. While I naturally agree with these objectives, Mrs Figueiredo’s report, in trying to list certain measures, often appears excessive, which risks being counterproductive to the cause of gender equality.

      <p sl="lt">I voted for this report because we must continue to enhance the situation of women in the labour market and society. Women are often exposed to multiple discrimination because of their sex, age (especially in the case of older women), disability, ethnic/racial background, religion, national origin, migration status and socio-economic status, including women in single-person households, and compound discrimination creates multiple barriers to women’s empowerment and social advancement. The reconciliation of work, family and private life also remains an unresolved issue for both women and men. I would like to draw attention to the fact that those living in poverty – more than 85 million in all – are for the most part women, a situation brought about by unemployment, casual and unstable labour and low wages not even sufficient for minimum subsistence. Moreover, in recent years the number of women in poverty has risen disproportionately compared with the number of men. Sadly, the danger of being reduced to poverty is much greater for women, so we must increase the opportunities for women to find work in the general labour market. Thus in order to improve the situation of women in the future and ensure gender balance in contemporary society, gender equality policies in different fields of activity, including the economic, financial, commercial and social spheres, should be based on an integrated approach.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 road map for equality between women and men, and subscribe to its recommendations. The persistence of gender inequality is a denial of fundamental rights about which much remains to be done in Europe. We need the European Institute for Gender Equality to start its work monitoring relevant gender indicators, which will depend on gender-disaggregated statistics for accurate assessments. While female employment in Europe has risen to almost 60%, we need to work towards the financial emancipation of women without sacrificing quality of employment or redoubling the burden of those women who care for dependents. The persistent gender pay gap needs to be addressed through a review of the equal pay directive. Affordable quality care services are both a demographic and equality imperative. The same goes for state-borne parenthood costs, and the prevention of discriminatory practices in the private sector. The Commission must closely monitor, and act upon, Member State infringements of non-discrimination directives and gender-related measures. It should also come forward with a proposal on a directive to combat violence against women. This Parliament has to be consulted on the drafting of the European Charter of Women's rights.</p>

This is why, as I have said before, men and women must be treated as equals, granting them the same rights, but responding to their particular needs, which in the case of women, is clearly in areas such as protecting maternity, a compromise between professional and family life and very special protection against crimes that are, essentially, committed against women and children, such as sexual exploitation, people trafficking or ill treatment. Once more, however, I would stress that, without denying the right of women to control their sexual and reproductive rights, no vote of this Parliament could, in any circumstances, try to grant them a right to voluntary termination of pregnancy.

In particular, I supported an amendment stressing the need to make gender reassignment procedures accessible for transgender persons, and to ensure that they are reimbursed by public health insurance schemes, and an amendment adding that this new strategy should address the fight against discrimination arising from gender reassignment. The rights of transgender people are just as important as those of other citizens, and the European Commission needs to take that into account.</p>

However, this should not invalidate the fundamental principle that people should be chosen on the basis of a criterion of competence and, furthermore, we should not allow more qualified people, regardless of gender, to be overlooked in favour of less qualified people as a result of a purely administrative imposition. It should be added that we should always reject the use of camouflaged excuses, the economic crisis or any others, to try surreptitiously to introduce profound changes on controversial matters that are not given justified visibility, namely the policy on abortion.</p>

The problems include everything from salaries – the average pay gap is 17% – to measures to protect mothers. Women are often faced with the choice of having children or continuing to work.

Furthermore, women are more at risk of poverty than men and this has become clear in particular in our current difficult economic climate.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting in favour of this joint motion for a resolution. Good neighbourly relations between the EU and Russia are fundamental to the stability, safety and prosperity of the whole of Europe. Aware that we share responsibilities in terms of promoting stability, the EU and Russia have been intensifying negotiations and seeking new partnerships for cooperation that go beyond mere economic cooperation and also include the areas of the rule of law and respect for human rights. A good example of this reinforced cooperation that I would like to highlight is the signing of the joint statement on Gaza by the Vice-President of the Commission and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, and the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov. I also consider the progress that Russia has made in order to be able to fulfil the objective of accession to the WTO to be very positive, namely abandoning protectionist measures, which is an essential prerequisite that should continue. Finally, I would like to underline the need to involve Russia in the EU’s Baltic Sea Strategy, specifically by improving maritime safety and guaranteeing a high level of environmental protection.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Russia is still very far from being a country in which human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law are fully guaranteed. It is therefore unrealistic to hide this fact, pretending that there is full understanding between the two blocs on issues relating to rights, freedoms and guarantees. Having said this, I must welcome the holding of the EU-Russia Summit and I hope that Russia moves towards becoming the credible, reliable, democratic and secure ally that the European Union needs so badly.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I therefore believe that it will be fully to the EU’s advantage to support Russian efforts to democratise and strengthen the specific partnerships with the country that are bringing it closer to the other European states with which it shares a history and culture. If the European institutions and the Member States contribute to making possible Peter the Great’s dream of a Russia that is fully integrated into the concert of nations and, in particular, the Europe of which it is a part, they will have done a great service to world stability.</p>

We should share not only economic and commercial interests, but also the objective of close cooperation at a global level and in relation to common neighbouring countries, in accordance with international law. Therefore, the EU and Russia must intensify their negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement that is broad, wide-ranging and legally binding. This agreement must go beyond economic cooperation and also integrate the areas of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental human rights. I support the objective of Russian accession to the WTO to help this country to attract more foreign investment and diversify its economy. Russia’s establishment of a customs union with Belarus and Kazakhstan may put additional obstacles in the Russian Federation’s path towards WTO membership.</p>

The deepening of relations between the EU and Russia is something that I consider to be particularly important, not only for reasons relating to energy policy, but also, and especially, for historical and cultural reasons. The EU must formulate its foreign policy on the Caucasus in cooperation with Russia and must not allow itself to be dictated to by the US in this regard. Thus, we should behave in a very fair way in respect of the Georgia conflict and focus on providing support for the people living there. Neither would it be appropriate for the EU to impose large demands or conditions in respect of Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation. Finally, it has to be said that relations with Russia following the conclusion of the Partnership for Modernisation are on good terms and on the right track.</p>

In view of the fact that liberalisation of trade favours both sides, and the perspective of membership of the WTO is a driving force for change and reform, I support Russia’s membership. We should also look at the question of EU visa policy in the context of the countries of the Eastern Partnership. Why should Russia be treated differently than, for example, Ukraine? Despite the fact that talks are in progress at EU level, Moscow is still pursuing a different policy with particular Member States. It is in our interest that the EU speak with one voice.</p>

This is a difficult process that must be carried out by means of many small- and large-scale actions, beginning, firstly, with the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and, secondly, with the release of Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier who has been held by Hamas since June 2006.</p>

I believe that it is time for the European Union to have a much more interventionist and autonomous role in seeking a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The secular relationships of some EU countries with the Arab world, the incomparable and committed support of Europe to give the National Palestinian Authority the means to be able to turn itself into a viable and autonomous state, the unparalleled dimension of humanitarian aid for the reconstruction of the Palestinian areas and the traditional relationships of friendship and partnership with Israel, make the EU a credible partner and an agent that cannot be replaced. We are living through a period of a dangerous increase in tension and violence in the Middle East. Each tragic event promotes more hatred and lack of understanding, feeding radicalism and inspiring fundamentalism. With the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU finally has institutional bases to project a foreign, security and defence policy that is compatible with its demographic dimension and economic importance. Without presumption, while being aware of the magnitude of the problem and without being either naive or masochistic, it is time for Europe to take on this challenge!</p>

Furthermore, the attempt to break the naval blockade imposed because of Hamas’s violent seizure of power in Gaza can only be considered an act of hostility, regardless of what name it is given. Irrespective of the need to support the most weak and vulnerable among the Palestinians, it must be acknowledged that Hamas, which manipulates and mobilises them, still fails to acknowledge the state of Israel and that several of its most senior militants have repeatedly called for its destruction.

Israel cannot go unpunished and the EU has the political and criminal tools to do this. It is continuing to violate the Annapolis agreements by continuing with the settlements.

This is irony on my part: the Turkish army could, along with German soldiers, jointly control the entry points into Gaza in order to ensure that food and construction materials get through, and to prevent weapons from entering. We should do what we can to help lift the blockade and provide the tools needed to do so. It is said that many Europeans, particularly Germans, have a guilty conscience with regard to Israel.

      <p sl="sv">It is highly regrettable that people have lost their lives in this incident and every death is a dreadful loss. However, the resolution that we have been giving our views on is not simply a means of expressing the condolences of the European Parliament. It is specifically intended to represent a political position and, as such, it is unbalanced. It does not take into account the fact that Hamas is a terrorist organisation which aims to obliterate the state of Israel. Hamas is not mentioned in the text of the resolution, which seems rather strange, given that it is one of the parties involved in the conflict. The resolution calls on Israel to take action, but ignores the fact that Hamas is also in a position to take the initiative on an agreement or a peaceful solution. It also seems odd that the resolution firstly makes a strong condemnation of the attack on the Free Gaza ship and then calls for an investigation into it. The result of this is that the condemnation anticipates the conclusions of the investigation which is being called for. Israel is urged to end the blockade on Gaza immediately without any concessions being granted in return, despite the fact that the reasons for Israel introducing the blockade are well known.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the decision of MEPs from across the political spectrum to support this strong resolution condemning Israel for its unprovoked and disproportionate attacks on the Free Gaza humanitarian aid flotilla. I understand that this was the strongest position that Parliament could adopt as a whole, due to differences in position between and within different political groups, and to have such a unified position sends a very clear and unambiguous message to Israel and the international community. Despite voting in favour of the resolution, however, I would have liked it to go even further. Immediately following the attack on the flotilla, I wrote to Commissioner Cathy Ashton, calling for an immediate suspension of the EU Israel Association agreement. Israel has consistently breached the human rights clause of this agreement and its latest move should not be tolerated. I believe that we need actions as well as words from the EU to show that the international community deplores both the siege on Gaza and Israel’s attack on the Free Gaza flotilla. I will continue to call for the suspension of this agreement whenever the opportunity arises, until Israel can demonstrate that it is upholding its human rights obligations towards Palestine.</p>

We urgently needed to call them to order with our vote on this resolution. Indeed, we should encourage Member States to contribute to promoting human rights in the world in a more diligent manner, and to controlling international trade in items used for torture, rather than taking part in it. I even think that sanctions should be used to dissuade them from doing so. Furthermore, this resolution rightly calls on the Commission to update the list of torture items, given that they are constantly changing. I have therefore voted in favour of this text, but I do believe that we need to go even further.</p>

The Czech Republic exported electro-shock devices among others to Pakistan and Moldova. Unfortunately, in the resolution, the responsible countries are not mentioned.

Similarly, we urge that this incident should not trigger a military escalation on the peninsula.

According to my research after the meeting, such a report can only be expected next year, the subject has not even been decided by the coordinators. Our group regrets that we have now missed out on the chance to raise the issue this session, when we could have discussed it with Ms. Ashtron.

It is thus clear today that Bosnia and Herzegovina has a long and rocky road ahead of it before it can actually apply for EU membership. Unfortunately, the term ‘balkanisation’ still means division, fighting over the same land and a conflict that cannot be easily resolved.

It contains no real guarantee as regards the protection of personal (Passenger Name Record) data, which the United States records at will, to the detriment of the rights of European citizens. I am voting against this resolution, this deregulating machine that is characteristic of everything that foreshadows the major transatlantic market of the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The first railway package, which was adopted in 2001 and contains three directives on the development of the Community’s railways, on the licensing of railway undertakings and on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification, was intended to revitalise the rail industry by acting as a first step towards the creation of an integrated European railway area. However, according to the report of the Commission on monitoring the development of the rail market, the rail share in transport has not increased but only stabilised to the low level of around 10% in the rail freight market and to less than 7% for passenger transport. Therefore, in this resolution that I have supported, Parliament calls on the Member States to properly implement this railway package, and calls on the Commission to better guarantee that proper implementation.</p>

I believe that the independence of the infrastructure manager is a precondition for fair, transparent and non-discriminatory treatment of all operators. It is necessary for there to be standards to guarantee the independence of infrastructure managers, especially when they are part of a railway holding that is also involved in rail transport activities. The level of investment in rail infrastructure maintenance is insufficient in a large number of Member States, leading, in several cases, to a deterioration in the quality of the existing infrastructure. It is proposed that the Commission review the first railway package by September 2010, and that it deal as a matter of priority with problems such as the independence of the infrastructure managers and the lack of resources and powers of the regulatory bodies. It is also hoped that it will propose adequate charging principles for access to the infrastructure that stimulate public and private investment in the rail sector. The liberalisation of the rail market should not detract from the quality of rail transport service, and should safeguard public service obligations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The resolution regrets the various Member States’ delay in implementing the three first railway package directives, as this delay is preventing fair competition in the railway market. As a result of this, the actual objective of this package is once again condemned: to open up rail transport, especially that of freight, to competition and private interests, as a first step towards the entire liberalisation of the sector at EU level. It is up to the Member States to decide on the areas in which they should perform their social duties through public services, and also on the way in which these public services should be organised. This is a sovereign choice of the people that must be respected. We are therefore opposed to all kinds of antidemocratic enforcement of measures that conflict with the interest of the people, such as the one this resolution clearly embodies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Liberalisation is the cause of, and not the solution to, the principal problems of the railway sector, particularly of all those relating to the quality and accessibility of the service and the rights of workers. It is vital to put a stop to and reverse the persistent policies that dismantle and shrivel the public transport sector, with a view to surrendering it to the profit logic of the large private interests. In this case it is above all a sector of strategic importance for the future from both an energy and an environmental perspective.</p>

Firstly, the achievement of an unequivocal interpretation of the independence of infrastructure providers. Secondly, completion of true liberalisation of the railway market, an absolute priority for all European Union Member States. For this reason, the European Commission must step up its actions to establish realistic deadlines. Lastly, while we await liberalisation, compliance with the principle of reciprocity must be guaranteed to prevent unfair competition between competing companies in countries with an open market. I submitted a specific amendment on this aspect to the committee and its content was implemented in the final text, which I wholeheartedly support.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Today’s resolution does not take the issue in the right direction. The reason this sector is experiencing difficulties or problems is not because Member States have failed to implement the first railway package properly or fully – quite the contrary. The liberalisation of the rail network has obviously led to a logic of pure profitability and to the disorganisation of the sector. In France, high-speed railway lines and journeys are given precedence over slower, regional services. Prices have increased. In many cases, however, passengers’ needs and expectations are being completely overlooked, to the extent that even the timetables are inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any event, they are being adhered to less and less. The network is being maintained accordingly and has deteriorated on many routes – on those that have not closed altogether, that is. In the United Kingdom and Belgium, this approach has been partly responsible for rail crashes. Users of the electricity sector and the postal service are already experiencing difficulties of a similar nature. You have a duty to regulate telephone rates, as there is so much abuse.

That being the case, the creation of rail corridors that allow for fast and effective connection from one national network to another will enable the infrastructure usage conditions to improve. More competitive rail transport compared with that currently used brings not only economic, but also environmental benefits. That is why I voted as I did.</p>

Using a sledgehammer to smooth the way for European network management will not solve the problems, however. On the contrary, centralising and fragmenting the responsibilities will generate new problems. Not only could this plan have a negative effect on the quality and safety of rail transport, but we can also expect a reduction in service.

      <p sl="pl">In recent years, freight transport has developed considerably. However, this trend is not to be seen in rail transport. Despite extensive efforts of the Union intended to increase the competitiveness of rail transport, we are witnessing a gradual decline in the share of the rail market in freight transport. For more than 30 years (1970-2005), a 10% reduction has been noted. It is, therefore, essential to create an effective, environmentally-friendly and safe system of rail transport which will benefit the citizens as well as businesses, making this form of transport more competitive and reversing the current disadvantageous situation in the market. In order to meet this challenge it is essential to consolidate the supranational cooperation of all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, in view of recent events in Europe following the eruption of the volcano in Iceland, which paralysed air traffic, it should be a priority to create a trans-European rail transport network in as short a time as possible. It should also be said that rail transport is safe for the environment, and is faster and does not need such extensive infrastructure as road transport. The opening of European freight transport corridors seems to be a good step towards initiating fruitful international cooperation in the area of rail transport. I am convinced that this will contribute to the establishment of an efficient European internal transport market. Creation of a competitive supranational system will contribute to an increase in the cohesion of the European Union’s economic development. I would like to state my profound conviction that establishing this system will bring economic, environmental and administrative effects.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The first railway package adopted in 2001 contained elements that, in my opinion, can serve to integrate the European rail network, both passengers and freight, and thus take advantage of synergies and further consolidate the internal market and territorial cohesion. The three directives of this package, however, which concerned the development of the rail network, the licensing of railway undertakings and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the charging of infrastructure fees, and which aimed to modernise this method of transport, have yet to be transposed by the majority of Member States, especially Portugal. That being the case, I agree that it makes sense for the European Commission to revise the first package and in particular the most problematic issues such as the independence of infrastructure managers, the legal framework for the regulatory bodies and track access charging methods.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Any changes in the rail transport sector must safeguard the main aspects that underpin the provision of public services, especially insofar as its quality and security and the affordability of fares for both citizens and companies are concerned.

As I said before, I believe that the Fund’s structure and availability must be improved and its mobilisation needs to be evaluated on a regular basis so as to make this mechanism better able to play a part in reducing the impact on Member States and promoting the reconstruction of the most devastated areas in a flexible, timely and appropriate manner.</p>

I also advocate the need for Member States to comply with the requirements stipulated in the Floods Directive, and to review the planning, land use policies and best practices in the light of the increased risks of flooding stemming from the way land, habitats and drainage are managed, and to increase the capacity of flood-control and drainage infrastructure in order to limit the damage caused by extreme rainfall.

Given the extent of the material and human cost of these floods in central Europe and France, it seems logical to make the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) available as quickly as possible, and to use it effectively in order to help rebuild the damaged areas; this is my reason for voting in favour of this resolution. In order for that to happen, however, a new regulation on the EUSF is also needed, because the process required to access the funds is currently too drawn-out and complicated.

      <p sl="pt">I voted in favour of this report because I believe we urgently need to adopt an EU aquaculture strategy. The situation as it stands is characterised by a whole range of Community legislation from a number of origins and sources that vary in each Member State, and renders it impossible to achieve the objectives that contribute to the growth of an innovative and potentially high-technology economic sector that is capable of promoting regional development in various maritime, coastal and island regions, as well as throughout the EU as a whole. I must mention research potential and the use of cutting-edge technology that foster the employment and retraining of traditional fishermen and provide a catalyst for associated economic activities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I must also mention that a single legislative framework and both appropriate labelling and certification are necessary for the development of such a strategy. It is necessary, moreover, to empower this sector through necessary investment – without jeopardising other sectors or overlooking the most diverse environmental impacts – since aquaculture, as a supplementary activity for our coastal communities, can also play a part in overcoming the shortage of fish that is usually present in our diet.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European aquaculture industry consists of more than 16 500 companies, with a total annual turnover of more than EUR 3.5 billion, generating some 64 000 direct and indirect jobs. European aquaculture production doubled to 1.3 million tonnes between 1981 and 2001, but more or less stagnated (+0.5%) until 2008, whereas world production grew very rapidly (+7.6% a year) over the same period. There is currently no specific and harmonised EU legislative framework for the aquaculture sector. On the contrary, it is governed by a variety of EU legislative texts in different areas (environment, public health, etc.) and national legislation which varies considerably from one Member State to another, thereby creating confusion among operators in the sector, in addition to causing discrimination and distortions of the market. I am therefore in favour of a proposed regulation that consolidates all the Community provisions regulating the aquaculture sector into a single text, which will result in a clear, stable legislative framework and legal certainty. I therefore voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">We share the view expressed in the report that the aquaculture sector has great potential to contribute to economic and social development in a large number of regions, especially in coastal and rural regions, as well as to promote local production and employment. We welcome the simplification and streamlining measures that are to be adopted by the Member States at legislative level as a means of regulating and monitoring the sector.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The impact of aquaculture on the environment is currently one of the main restrictions on the development of the sector. The amount of animal protein used in feeding the cultivated species is still disproportionately high with respect to the yield obtained, particularly in saltwater aquaculture. In many cases there are still problems concerning the discharge of effluents containing high pollution loads into natural habitats.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The report acknowledges these problems along with others and points out – rightly so – the importance of investing in research and development in order to resolve them, thus improving environmental and economic sustainability and viability in the sector. Despite the fair criticism of the ‘proliferation of private certifications’, we believe that the report should have gone further in this area and firmly backed the importance of a public certification system for the food and environmental quality of aquaculture products. There is also a need for greater regulation of trade.</p>

The European fisheries industry has high quality standards and a great deal of specialist knowledge and we must continue to support it. One important aspect of this is to promote research and development. Together with the upstream and downstream production and processing sectors, the European fisheries industry is responsible for thousands of jobs within the EU and these jobs must be protected. For these reasons, I support European Parliament resolution P7_TA(2010)0243 for the sustainable development of European aquaculture.</p>

      <p sl="de">Particularly in view of the possible negative impact of aquaculture, it is all the more important for there to be clear standards here. However, clear standards must not mean that the EU lays down regulations in this regard, because when we harmonise our regulations we naturally always settle on the lowest common denominator. Firstly, this is not acceptable in the name of environmental protection and nature conservation. Secondly, this matter must not be used to further ambitions towards more centralisation, and thirdly, absolutely no consideration has been given to the situation of the local fishermen – after all, there are 170 million jobs connected to the fisheries industry worldwide. For the aforementioned reasons, I have no option but to reject this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Environmental problems with aquaculture are multitude. It can cause local pollution if farms are placed in poor sites or in too great a density; escaped fish can interfere with reproduction of local stocks (genetic pollution); high densities favour diseases and parasites that must be fought with antibiotics, vaccines, etc; there are animal welfare concerns over the conditions of the animals. Probably the most important problem, though, is that for many species of farmed fish, including the most popular ones such as salmon, the farmed animals must be fed with fish - so we have the absurd situation of fishing to feed fish that are reared in cages. Herbivorous species such as carp do not have this problem, though. FISH accepted a number of our amendments that were intended to counter these points - to insist that European aquaculture must concentrate on herbivorous species, that depletion of wild fish stocks to feed farmed fish is not sustainable, that subsidies for aquaculture must be based upon environmental impact assessments.</p>

      <p sl="en">Fish is a healthy food, and we should do everything possible to promote a sustainable fish sector to provide it. This includes developing a legislative framework which helps the aquaculture sector to deliver a secure supply of high-quality, healthy food and better protection for the environment. Over-fishing of wild stocks has devastating impacts on delicate coastal and river environments, as well as on local communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aquaculture has the potential to address all these concerns – by reducing pressure on wild stocks and biodiversity, and by creating jobs in coastal and rural regions. As co-legislators, we must take the opportunity to shape future legislation in the right way.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should pay particular attention to animal welfare in any future legislation.

      <p sl="pt">This is a crucial issue in Madeira and, at the time the Plan for Economic and Social Development of the Autonomous Region of Madeira 2007-2013 was being prepared, the fisheries sector, and particularly aquaculture, was identified as one of the thematic priorities.

      <p sl="pt">It should be noted that the only way to achieve structured and sustainable development in the sector that is environmentally balanced and promotes competition between its operators, and in turn offers consumers greater quality assurance, is through adequate funding, especially from the European Fisheries Fund, and investment in new technologies and experimental research.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, on the eve of the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the independence of the Democratic Republic of Congo, we thought it was important for the European Parliament to give its opinion on the murder of Mr Chebeya Bahizire.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Chebeya Bahizire was a human rights defender and the director of the NGO ‘Voice of the Voiceless’. He was a famous Congolese activist. He was found dead in his car in a suburb of Kinshasa on 2 June this year, and his driver, Fidèle Bazana, has not been located or found since.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My questions are: why was he killed? Who killed him? I think that, as is emphasised in the resolution, an independent, credible, thorough and transparent committee of inquiry should be set up to establish the truth about the death of Mr Chebeya Bahizire and to shed light on the disappearance of his driver.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are all aware that the general deterioration of the situation of human rights defenders in the Democratic Republic of Congo is particularly worrying. Cases involving many human rights defenders, including Pascal Kabungulu Kibembi in 2005, and several journalists, have still not been solved. Investigations led by the Congolese military authorities have been characterised by serious irregularities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore consider it essential to identify those responsible for these murders, to bring them to justice, in accordance with Congolese law and with international provisions on the protection of human rights, in order to put an end to the impunity. Punishing those responsible for murdering human rights defenders and journalists is an essential part of democracy. We said so again this morning, in Mrs Hautala’s report. The resolution therefore calls on the European Union and on the Democratic Republic of Congo, as signatories to the Cotonou Agreement, which explicitly refers to respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, to pay particular attention to these matters when evaluating the Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore think that Parliament should encourage the Congolese authorities to comply fully with the declaration on human rights defenders adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1998 and to implement the recommendations of the United Nations 2009 Universal Periodic Review, which are measures designed to protect the rights of human rights defenders. That is the message I will be taking to Kinshasa for the 30 June celebrations. I think it is important to inform people of this.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Yesterday, in this Chamber, we talked about the protection of human rights defenders around the world in a general way. Today, we are talking about the very specific case of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, who died because he was a defender of human rights. All the indications are that he was killed precisely because of who he was and what he was doing. Those who were behind this murder certainly had some objectives of their own. We do not fully know what those objectives were, but there is one thing of which we are certain: those objectives were absolutely opposed to our objectives, by which I mean a consistent upholding of human rights. Human rights and those who defend them are opposed because their activity leads to increased social awareness, and citizens who know their rights are an enormous threat to the abuses of the authorities.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Congo is a large and important country. The murder of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire must be solved. The perpetrators must be lawfully punished, so the investigation must be independent, credible, scrupulous and thorough. This is what we insist on in our resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the murder of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, executive director of the human rights organisation ‘Voice of the Voiceless’, when he had just been summoned by the police, and the disappearance of his driver, are unfortunately quite symbolic of the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We might also wonder why Mr Chebeya’s family is not even allowed to see his body. Mr Chebeya was known for his stance against the Congolese leaders. He regularly reported the dramatic developments in the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo to NGOs and the media. It is no longer possible to keep track of the number of journalists and human rights activists who are threatened, arrested, tortured and murdered in that country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Pascal Kabungulu, in 2005, Franck Ngycke, his wife Hélène Mpaka, and Serge Maheshe in 2007, and Didace Namujimbo in 2008, are just a few of the many victims. The icing on the cake, if I may describe it as such, was when the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for the arrest of Bosco Ntaganda, and the Congolese Government rewarded him with a promotion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Meanwhile, the economic and social situation in the country continues to deteriorate. A climate of civil war prevails in one part of the country: massacres, mass rape and the recruitment of child soldiers are now, dare I say, part of the landscape.</p>

Congo is a huge hotbed of destabilisation, which is continually being exported to other countries, but which is then also brought into Congo from outside.

      <p sl="ro">This is why I believe that European Union diplomacy must urge the Congolese authorities to carry out an independent, credible and transparent inquiry, which will identify and bring to justice the culprits. The Congolese Government’s first responsibility is to combat the culture of impunity which is conducive to human rights violations in a country where civil war is used as a justification for massacres, mass rape and other atrocities.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, sadly the killing of Mr Bahizire 15 days ago is not an isolated tragedy. As the UN Special Rapporteur has said, this killing strongly suggests official responsibility. We notice that politically motivated killings are part of a growing trend of intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, political opponents, victims and witnesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the past five years.</p>
      <p sl="en">We express our deep sorrow and sympathy to the family of Mr Bahizire and we call on the Council and the Commission to put pressure on the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo to provide for normal conditions for human rights defenders and to bring those responsible to justice.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I am pleased that we have been able to include the case of Mr Chebeya Bahizire in our plenary so promptly. I first want to express my condolences to the family of that brave man who risked his own life in the name of democracy and human rights. Mr Chebeya Bahizire frequently reported that he was being spied on and watched by the authorities. The international community, which admired his work, was nevertheless unable to protect him.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Similar murders are part of a growing trend in harassment and oppression targeted at human rights defenders, journalists and representatives of the political opposition in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Several reporters and human rights activists have been killed in the country over the last five years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As our resolution points out, it is important that the authorities agree to the request made by Mr Chebeya Bahizire’s family to have an autopsy carried out by completely independent experts. In addition, it is essential to appoint an independent and impartial committee to investigate Mr Chebeya Bahizire’s death and the fate of his driver, who disappeared. Thirdly, let me stress that Congo must fight against corruption and bring the perpetrators of human rights crimes to justice, starting with the crimes that its own army and police forces are guilty of.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to begin by expressing my condolences to the family of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire. The murder of this respected defender of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo is unacceptable and must, as my fellow Members have also said, be condemned.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that an independent, credible and transparent inquiry is required to clarify the circumstances in which this act took place. In this situation, I feel that the involvement of the UN would be useful because, as the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions emphasised, there are clues that ‘suggest official responsibility in carrying out the murder’.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also wish to mention that this murder highlights a worrying trend in the Democratic Republic of Congo during recent years because a number of human rights activists have been murdered there, including journalists. The authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo must fight resolutely against the culture of impunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the authors of this resolution. The murder of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire on 2 June has led to more than 50 organisations, and Ban Ki-moon himself, calling for an independent investigation. His work defending human rights led to threats to his life including repeated threats from the police, and it is my understanding that he was actually visiting an inspector at a police station on 1 June; we know that on 2 June his body was found.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to seek reassurances that the Commission and the Council will press for an independent investigation, and also that his family will be kept safe.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this horrific case recalls the worst abuses that one of Africa’s most noted kleptocrats, the late Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire, a country that eventually became the DRC. The change of name has sadly not changed the political culture in this country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights defenders still face grave dangers in doing their job. Journalists are routinely threatened and sometimes killed. Indeed, the name of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire is the latest in a long line of courageous human rights defenders who paid the ultimate price for their convictions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I sincerely hope that this case will result in a conviction of another kind, and that in the longer term the EU will redouble its efforts to strengthen civil society in the DRC. I am also convinced that the climate of political violence and impunity in the DRC – and in other parts of Africa sometimes – is linked to the control of resources, especially minerals. I have previously urged the Commission to consider extending the Kimberley Process of certification beyond diamonds – the blood diamond story, as it were – to other minerals. I believe this would be a significant step forward in helping to address the lawlessness that continues to claim the lives of brave men such as this man in particular.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission learned about the death of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire with deep sadness. Floribert was one of the most well-known active and vocal human rights defenders in the DRC, leader of the organisation La Voix des Sans-Voix , with whom the Commission works regularly and which is one of the most respected human rights organisations in the DRC. The circumstances of his death strongly suggest that such a loss might indeed be a murder that could implicate DRC officials.</p>
      <p sl="en">Accordingly, the death of Floribert gave rise to strong reactions not only in the DRC but also from the international community. The EU and a number of our Member States, but also the United Nations and the United States, have all expressed their concerns and urged a serious investigation in order to establish the facts and avoid impunity. The facts should be properly investigated and the perpetrators should be effectively prosecuted. President Kabila has already expressed his wish to clarify the events; some suspects from the national police forces have been arrested and the Head of the National Police has been suspended until further notice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The DRC authorities have also accepted a Dutch offer of cooperation. A Dutch medical team examined Mr Chebeya and should be able in the coming weeks to provide further clarification of the circumstances of his death. The DRC’s initial response does indeed indicate that the authorities understand the need to promote an impartial, credible and transparent investigation. The European Union, together with Member States with a presence in Kinshasa, will nevertheless follow up closely the developments on this issue with a view to encouraging the authorities to achieve rapid and concrete results.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a more general note, the EU would welcome the DRC Government stepping up its efforts to fight against impunity and is ready to support such efforts by helping the DRC to uphold its human rights obligations and its commitment to the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Benjamin Franklin once said that ‘the US Constitution does not guarantee happiness, only the pursuit of it’. Today, the citizens of Nepal cannot even count on being able to pursue happiness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Work on the constitution continues to drag on, and the main actors on the political stage, including the Maoist Unified Communist Party of Nepal, are not ready for compromise, while the army is still surrounded by an atmosphere of secrecy regarding how it is financed and the way it recruits. Meanwhile, at the opposite pole and far from the structures of the state, 30 million citizens are exposed to extreme poverty and illiteracy, and do not have access to electricity or communications. Nepal is stuck in a trap of poverty, and is squandering the natural potential of its strategic geographical location and exceptional natural features. Therefore, we appeal to the Nepalese authorities not to squander the 2008 peace agreement, but to strive consistently for promulgation of the new constitution, which would not only define the rights and responsibilities of citizens, but could become a symbol of a new democratic page in the history of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As a Member from a country scarred by historical divisions, I understand what a difficult period is currently being experienced by Nepal. A constitution and international appeals will not guarantee the citizens of Nepal happiness, but may help them to pursue it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Nepal’s political instability is hardly surprising given the tumultuous changes that have taken place in that country over the last two decades. The palace massacres of 2001 fatally undermined the monarchy, and King Gyanendra’s attempts to impose absolute rule to combat Maoist insurgents failed dismally. The Maoists took power and abolished the monarchy two years ago, but were quickly displaced by a coalition of their opponents.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would appear now that the advent of republican democracy has been a bit of a false dawn. Certainly the ordinary people of Nepal continue to suffer from high rates of unemployment, disease, malnutrition and, as this resolution makes clear, violence and even possibly torture. The rapid political changes in Nepal were not accompanied, regrettably, by measures to promote reconciliation and good transitional justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope the EU will concentrate its efforts now in this field in particular as well as providing essential humanitarian aid. Nepal risks becoming a failing state and that is a risk we can ill afford with so many other security challenges in South Asia.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Jean Lambert, who is not able to be here with us. She is the Chair of the Delegation for relations with South Asia, which covers Nepal. She wanted us to say the following.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that in the last few years Nepal has made many positive changes, as outlined in the joint resolution, under difficult circumstances. However, not surprisingly, in this developing situation we have seen both setbacks in implementation of the peace agreement and a failure to meet the deadline of 28 May this year for the delivery of the new draft constitution which would permanently entrench the principles of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Constitutional Assembly has now been extended for one year under a three-point plan agreed between the three major parties at the last minute to deliver on both the peace agreement and the Constitution. We consider it very important that this opportunity rooted in the elected body is not lost.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a need for a constitutional and political civil society in order for greater development to take place. There are possibilities for the significant development of renewable energies, but investment will be difficult without stability, democracy and the rule of law firmly in place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Integration of the former Maoist combatants is urgent both for those individuals themselves and as a signal of real progress for the democratic process.</p>
      <p sl="en">We consider that the international committee, including the European Union, is willing to assist with practical measures if necessary, but regret the withdrawal of UNMIN in a few weeks’ time if progress has not been made.</p>
      <p sl="en">As has been said, Nepal has made significant progress towards embedding a democracy in the new republic and we would urge all parties involved to move forward on the three-point plan. Failure to do this would risk losing the trust of the Nepali people. Their opportunity for real development is closely linked to political progress.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The situation in Nepal is worrying as the violence in this country has exploded recently.</p>
      <p sl="ro">A new constitution definitely needs to be adopted to be able to consolidate the process of national reconciliation in the wake of the civil war which lasted 10 years and produced roughly 13 000 victims until it ended in 2006. This will be able to provide a legal framework for conducting political life in Nepal if democracy and human rights are promoted. In this regard, I think that the parties must hold negotiations without any preconditions with a view to creating a Constituent Assembly which will move the situation in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As is also highlighted in the reports from the international organisations for the protection of human rights, the judicial system also needs to be strengthened to be able to resolve conflict situations peacefully.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I wish to emphasise that the political instability is having an adverse impact on the social and economic situation in Nepal, which is already one of the poorest countries in the world. As you are well aware, no stability means no prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the overthrow of the feudalist monarchy in 2006 was a massive step forward for the people of Nepal. It was mass action by the working class, the peasants and the middle strata of society that achieved this victory with mass mobilisations of people power.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is quite clear that now a capitalist establishment and the right-wing political parties do not want this revolution to go any further as it would threaten their economic control and privileged position in Nepalese society. A shameful 50% of Nepal’s 29 million people live in abject poverty, 16% of whom are severely malnourished. Millions of landless exist with high illiteracy rates.</p>
      <p sl="en">With extensive support in Nepalese society, the Communist parties have made serious political errors in going into coalition government after 2006 with parties of the right whose wish was to achieve political power while maintaining economic relations, which simply means a continuation of poverty and deprivation because of the Maoists’ mistaken theory that a capitalist democracy is needed to pave the way for socialism.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the mass movement of 2006, and again a mass general strike in May of this year, clearly demonstrate that the working class and the poor want a socialist transformation and a system that will give them a future free of poverty and repression. The approach that is needed now by the parties genuinely representing the masses and wanting to transform Nepalese society is to give a clear lead independent of the establishment parties. That means breaking from coalitionism, and advancing a programme to take the main sources of wealth into public ownership and to be developed in democratic control of workers and peasants.</p>
      <p sl="en">Such a democratic socialist programme would allow for an economic and social transformation in Nepal and would also be a beacon to the tens of millions of poor in India and also working people in China. It is critical as well that there is full independence for the various national groups in Nepal, whose rights must be respected.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after a decade of civil war a peace deal was struck in Nepal in 2006, but unfortunately the country has become less peaceful despite the deal. Political fights are resulting in political instability and hamper important reforms such as a constitution for the republic, the deadline for which has recently had to be extended for one year.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also hampers the reintegration and rehabilitation of former PLA combatants. Nepal has such enormous potential to develop economically and to limit the prevailing poverty, but stability is essential in making that happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, accountability for the systematic abuse of laws of war needs to urgently happen, including among members of the PLA and the state security forces. The UN should play a role in this process, especially when it comes to participation in international armed forces. In Nepal itself the work of the Commission on Disappearances, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission on National Peace and Rehabilitation should result not only in a sense of responsibility for the past but a stake in a shared future as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">The parties – but also the Government – should end political interference in criminal proceedings to create a politically independent judiciary within the constitutional process and, in the same connection, to plan the ratification of the Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">We call on the EU and the Member States to support all the efforts of the Nepalese Government and the parties to find a solution to the integration of former Maoist combatants into the national army or other security forces and to find viable alternative solutions for those who cannot be integrated. The EU itself should also strictly adhere to a ban on exporting lethal weapons to Nepal as well as the export of any tools which can be used for torture or inhumane treatment, as was stated in the resolution which was adopted by this House today.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Although the civil war, which lasted 10 years, ended in 2006, Nepal’s economic and social situation continues to remain extremely dire. The lack of stability means that Nepal is unable to develop in the same way as its neighbours, China and India, countries with emerging economies. The alliance of 22 anti-Maoist parties failed to achieve the objective of adopting a constitution by the final deadline of 28 May 2010.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this respect, I welcome the decision to extend the Constituent Assembly’s mandate by one year. It is of paramount importance that Nepal adopts a constitution which will guarantee the proper functioning of the rule of law and respect for citizens’ freedoms.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the situation in Nepal has been causing constant concern to observers for many years. It is true that the first reasonably democratic elections were held there in 1959, but those democratic measures were very unstable and were rent asunder by acts of aggression. In recent years, it seemed we were witnessing a certain amount of progress in terms of security. First, in 2006, the Complex Peace Agreement was made, ending a civil war which had wasted the country for a decade. Later, in 2008, elections to the Constituent Assembly were held, which international observers deemed to have met a number of international standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Now, however, it is with regret that we have to note a deterioration of the situation in Nepal. The recent decision made by the political parties on the necessity for action to extend the mandate of the Constituent Assembly may be a significant step towards a return to peaceful government in the country. The European Union and the Member States should support every effort intended to establish understanding and stability in Nepal. We should also draw attention to the need to respect human rights and the rights of Christians, because, unfortunately, these too are being violated in Nepal.</p>

The 10-year civil war has left a great mark on the country and, quite honestly, only now can a certain light be seen at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p sl="pl">What can the European Parliament do? It can certainly support the democratic changes in Nepal, remembering, however, that the political parties which operate there have their own specific proposals, plans for reform and visions for the development of Nepal.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, a civil war lasting almost 10 years between Maoist fighters and the Royal Nepalese Army, as it was then, ended in a peace settlement in 2006. No winners or losers were declared. It was a unique situation, because the army, which had been under the monarch’s control and had fought against the Maoists, did not reach the settlement with them: it was the other political parties that did so.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Nepal is still trying to solve the problems connected with promoting the peace process. Many things that were agreed are awaiting implementation and people are growing restless. The main issue with regard to the incomplete peace process probably relates to the national army, its size and its leadership. The army needs to be democratically controlled. Nepal needs to be offered assistance, as former Maoists are integrated into its national army, security forces and other positions of responsibility. The UN should swiftly investigate the human rights crimes that have occurred among Nepalese peacekeeping forces.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal deserves praise for its valuable work. The international community must endeavour to participate consistently in the resolution of critical problems. The future of the peace agreement, however, lies in the hands of the Nepalese decision-makers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In addition to the comments made by my fellow Members concerning the tensions and violence in this country, I too wish to highlight one of the most painful aspects of the current situation facing Nepalese society: poverty. The population is suffering due to parlous living conditions, exacerbated by political instability, which is having an impact on Nepal’s potential for economic growth. As has already been mentioned in this Chamber, this country is situated geographically between two of the economies with the fastest growth rate in the world, China and India. However, Nepal is unable to utilise its potential due to the situation it is facing.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With a third of its population living below the absolute poverty line, a sixth of the population suffering from undernourishment, the highest rate of illiteracy in southern Asia and faced with an energy crisis and inflation, affecting food prices in particular, Nepal is not only a hotbed of tension, but also a serious humanitarian problem. This is why I believe that we not only need to focus political attention on the country, but also provide concrete support to help the development of the Nepalese economy and the Nepalese people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I was very fortunate to have returned from Nepal recently. The thing that we have to understand is that the Nepalese political process is very fragile, but progressing. However, it is very unreasonable, I think, for the political process to continue without disarmament on the side of the Maoists, because the Maoists have refused to take part in the political process. They want a change of government but are refusing to disarm.</p>
      <p sl="en">You cannot have a political process where there is an armed group of people who will not give up their arms to the authorities. Until this is secured by everybody concerned, we have to very gently persuade both sides in Nepal that it is in the longer-term interests of all the people of Nepal and the assistance of the European Union that they all disarm and come together to form whatever unity government they can.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It so happens that I lived in Nepal for several years. This was just at the time when the Nepalese people, with great effort, had begun trying to bring about change and improve their political system. At the time, nearly 20 years ago, I viewed this with great optimism. It has turned out that this process is much more difficult than any of us would have imagined. Nepal is, after all, a country with great cultural riches and history. The Nepalese people are profound and serious in their religion. They are a people of peace, and have a peaceful outlook on the world. We are talking, here, about Nepal’s huge economic potential. There is no economic potential in Nepal. It is a dramatic country which has practically no natural resources. In addition, it is subject to droughts and earthquakes. It is trying hard. It is in such a difficult situation, too, because it is, after all, crushed between two huge and very difficult neighbours. If we do not give Nepal all the help it needs, both political and material, it may end up like Tibet, and that would be an enormous and tragic loss for us all.</p>

It is positive to note that the constitutional crisis has been diverted by extending the deadline by another year.

Koirala, the high-level political mechanism’s fate seems uncertain, as it now lacks a consensus leader who could resolve disputes among the major political parties and drive the peace process forward. The EU has a key role to play in helping Nepal through this difficult process. A number of heads of missions’ statements, as well as a statement by the High Representative’s spokesperson, have been issued recently calling for all parties to come back to the negotiating table. The EU stands ready to support the Government of Nepal and help it rise to the challenges ahead. The EU should be prepared to assist in any process leading to a durable peace process. Collectively the EU and its Member States represent over 50% of the development aid received by Nepal. The Commission is contributing to the peace process by supporting the Nepal Peace Trust Fund. EUR 6 million were committed last year and EUR 22 million are planned for early 2011. So far the funds have been allocated for the maintenance of the Maoist cantonments, including salaries for ex-combatants. It is becoming increasingly important to ensure that the people of Nepal, whose expectations were raised after the 2006 peace movement, will receive the peace dividends they have been waiting for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Working closely with the European Union Member States, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all efforts, whether they are diplomatic, political or developmental, that may contribute towards a stable, democratic and peaceful Nepal.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I fully share my fellow Members’ concerns over the political situation in Nepal. As Members of the European Parliament, we have a constant duty to remind those contravening human rights of their obligations to the world at large. We must take an active part in establishing democracy and political stability in Nepal. However, for our criticism and recommendations to sound convincing, it is essential for us to provide a good example and put our own house – here in the European Union – in order. It is well known that in Latvia, over 20% of the population does not have the right to vote in elections. When joining the EU, Latvia promised to solve this problem, but it remains unsolved to this day. As a result, for 20 years now, more than 350 000 people in Latvia are stateless. The majority of these people have lived in Latvian territory for the whole of their lives, but they have no right to vote, work in the public sector or use their native tongue in governmental institutions. I consider that our announcements and wishes with respect to third countries will be considerably more powerful when the human rights of people in the EU will have ceased to be cynically disregarded on EU territory. People in glass houses should not throw stones.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, personally I have never taken an absolutist stance with regard to the death penalty, but surely it should only ever be countenanced in a handful of the most extreme and egregious criminal cases where the conviction is by due process and beyond all doubt.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I have very little confidence in the Libyan judicial system under the arbitrary and dictatorial nature of Muammar al-Gaddafi’s regime. He remains a dictator who controls his people through coercion and is intolerant of any dissent; that makes a mockery of Libya’s recent election to the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless he exercises leverage over the EU and the West in general through his control of Libya’s vast oil reserves. This important economic relationship notwithstanding, I do hope that the Commission will continue to raise at every opportunity the grave concerns we have in this House about human rights and fundamental freedoms in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all remember the infamous case of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya who were at one point sentenced to death before being finally released after much pleading from this House and the French President’s wife. We have a duty to do all we can to protect EU citizens from ever facing a similar situation in the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, we should welcome this resolution on the 18 executions that have taken place in Libya, and obviously condemn the death penalty in that country while urging the Libyans to make progress towards a moratorium; we should also ask for transparency and statistics. We should remember, however, that the names of those executed have not been disclosed and that those 18 people included some non-Libyan nationals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must welcome this resolution, which addresses the issue of refugees, Libya’s flawed policy regarding the protection of migrants, and the responsibility of Member States with regard to migration policy. It is unthinkable to consider a migratory agreement with Libya until Libya ratifies the Geneva Convention on Refugees. The reference to return, which is contrary to that Convention and to the fundamental principles of the European Union and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly Articles 18 and 19 thereof, is key.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Might I also mention the idea of using the current negotiations on the conclusion of a framework agreement with Libya as potential leverage to move towards compliance with international conventions on human rights and the ratification of the Geneva Convention on Refugees. The Treaty of Lisbon, and particularly Article 218 thereof, grants Parliament more rights, including the right to have the Commission provide it with the same information as the Council on the status of the negotiations on this agreement. That is why the European Parliament will be firm on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I apologise for earlier; I was really convinced I had two minutes. Last week the European Union and Libya signed a memorandum of understanding called a ‘national indicative programme’ (NIP) covering the period 2011-2013, with EUR 60 million earmarked for the development of human resources, of the health sector, and for common action in the fight against the illegal immigration situation, according to the text distributed to journalists.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This memorandum of understanding has been signed on the fringes of the seventh round of negotiations with Libya in which, I am sorry to say, the EU is making a fool of itself in front of the international press, particularly in Europe and Africa. We all know that Libya is a hub of immigration to Europe, but everyone knows what terrible fate is in store for those men and women who are fleeing poverty and persecution, hoping to find refuge in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Hundreds of them are imprisoned, executed, or suffer the worst possible abuse. Worse still, hundreds of them have simply been left in the middle of the Sahara desert without any food, dying of hunger and thirst.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In response to a question raised on this subject last week by one of my fellow Members, Mr Füle said – and I am quoting him here – that he would go there, with the Libyan interior minister, to see what was happening. Personally, I find such a response unacceptable. We know just how capable Mr Gaddafi is of deceiving the Western democracies. Our Swiss friends have just paid dearly for it. The most recent provocation was the closure of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the eve of the seventh round of negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Libyans are doing the dirty work for the European governments, most recently in Italian territorial waters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, how far will we go in our negotiations with Libya? Mr Barrot told us that no agreement on migration would be concluded until Libya had ratified the Geneva Convention. Commissioner, can you tell us what exactly is happening with the negotiating mandate given …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in 2007 and 2008, Libya voted against the United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on executions, and the repeated questioning by human rights organisations elicited no official statements either. It is therefore very important to us that the names of the people who have been executed are now officially revealed at last. Any execution is one too many. We condemn the use of executions and the death penalty. They are inhumane and cruel, and any execution is one too many.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our resolution, therefore, we clearly ask that we change this situation and bring it to light and that we now work together to bring about a change here. No more underreporting. Instead we want transparent information on what happens here and a humane penalty for genuine criminals, but no excessive punishment for those who criticise the regime in Tripoli.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Europe as a community of values is also a union where the death penalty is entirely banned and I am very proud of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Libya not only resists abolishing the death penalty, it also widely executes it, such as happened recently, on 30 May, when 18 people of different nationalities were executed, according to the Cerene newspaper, which is a paper close to the Government. This leads to all kinds of questions about free media, but it does lead us to believe that this is a credible source in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">The most serious punishment, the death penalty, is not only used in cases of serious crimes; freedom of association and expression have also led to the death penalty in Libya. We believe in more engagement of Libya with the international community and welcome this at any time over self-isolation of the people in the hands of their authoritarian regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2003 the EU lifted sanctions against the country and in 2007 negotiations on the framework agreement started. I very much hope we can continue to work together with Libya. However, this is only possible when the Libyan Government commits to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all its people. The recent closing of the UNHCR offices in Tripoli is another regrettable move which causes a further drifting-off of Libya from the international community.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of this, the United Nations should seriously rethink Libya’s place in its organisation. Given the continuing breaches of human rights, it is deplorable and highly inappropriate that Libya has a seat on the UN Human Rights Council. Membership of this Council should be granted only to those countries that respect human rights themselves. Otherwise the entire body loses its credibility, such as when Iran was a member of the Women’s Rights Council in the UN, which is equally regrettable and tarnishes the credibility of the entire organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Parliament urges Libya to end death penalties and to ensure fair trials in line with international standards. Member States in Europe should be aware of their responsibilities when extraditing refugees and others to Libya, as there is a serious risk that these people will be subject to inhumane treatment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I join my colleagues in deploring the execution of 18 people in Libya on 30 May 2010 and in calling for the abolition of capital punishment. Libya uses the death penalty as a tool for curbing free expression and association in the country. Documentation of such cases is made difficult by the government. However, Human Rights Watch interviewed one prisoner who said that the authorities had commuted his death sentence at the last moment to life in prison. According to Mr al-Sharif, the People’s Court convicted him and two other men of organising a political group which opposed the principles of the al-Fateh revolution. The Supreme Court confirmed the death sentences but the Supreme Council for Judicial Authority spared the prisoners’ lives at the last moment in February 2002 after they had spent one hour blindfolded and bound to a wooden stake awaiting execution.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to Mr al-Sharif, one of the three men committed suicide in December 2004. Reportedly, more than 200 people are currently on death row in Libya. I call on the Commission and the Council to raise these issues as a priority in their dialogue with Libya.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The death penalty is the most cruel and inhumane punishment possible. Libya is, in fact, one of the 12 countries which have already applied capital punishment in 2010, even though it is disapproved of by the UN and the majority of countries in the world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that it is the European Union’s duty to adopt a more robust approach to the task of calling for the abolition of the death penalty. At the same time, it is our duty to step up the pressure for having these sentences commuted and the rights of foreign nationals respected. Capital punishment is resorted to in the case of this group on a disproportionate scale because of the difficulties they face. They need to have a translator, contact diplomatic representatives from their governments and they cannot get the sentence commuted due to a lack of finances and family members who will negotiate financial compensation, according to local custom, with a view to obtaining forgiveness from the victim’s family.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In these circumstances, I think that a strong signal must be sent to the Libyan authorities to respect international norms on legal fairness. They must also allow the UN’s refugee agency to resume its activities for the benefit of refugees and asylum seekers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, at the end of May, 18 people were executed in Libya. It is reported that 200 people, including citizens of other countries, are currently in prison awaiting execution. That figure may, in fact, be higher, because there are no officially available statistics or data. Libya is applying a double standard. On the one hand, it has been elected to the UN Human Rights Council, which commits it to greater responsibility in the area of human rights. On the other hand, we are dealing with the fact that numerous people continue to be executed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Libya is a party, requires parties that have not abolished the death penalty to apply it ‘only for the most serious crimes’. In fact, Libyan courts usually hand down sentences of death for murder and drugs-related crimes, but also even for crimes related to peaceful activity and fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of speech and association. I appeal for cooperation and agreement between the European Union and Libya to be conditional on the ratification and implementation by Libya of the Geneva Convention on Refugees and other major human rights conventions and protocols.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The right to life and the protection of dignity are fundamental human rights. This is why most countries in the world, which account for over two-thirds of the world’s population, have already abolished capital punishment completely or have introduced a moratorium on its use. Reintroduction of use of the death penalty in any country represents a step back into the darkness of the Middle Ages.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The execution of 18 people in Libya is a egregious violation of human rights. The closure of the UNHCR office in Libya and the expulsion from Libya of its 26 staff is an act intended to hit at the 12 000 refugees whom they were helping.</p>
      <p sl="pl">A condition of entering into an agreement on immigration with Libya must be that Libya sign the Geneva Convention on Refugees and other major human rights conventions and protocols. In the European Union, human rights are a fundamental value. The rights of refugees must be guaranteed.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the EU is holding unofficial talks with Libya aimed at a cooperation agreement that would also extend to matters of immigration. It is very problematic and worrying given the current circumstances, because Libya has not demonstrated any obvious desire to respect international human rights agreements. Nor has it ratified the Geneva Convention, besides which it has no national asylum system in place.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As we have heard, on 30 May a total of 18 people were executed in Libya, and estimates suggest that more than 200 people are awaiting execution. Among those executed in May and those awaiting execution there are also foreigners.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we negotiate the cooperation agreement between the EU and Libya, we must make it a condition that Libya ratifies and implements the Geneva Convention relating to the status and rights of refugees and respects the other main human rights agreements it has entered into. I appeal to the Libyan Government to allow the UN Refugee Agency to coordinate and help establish a national asylum system for refugees in the country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We Europeans find the death penalty outrageous because, as you are all aware, it was abolished from our political culture, and what is happening at the moment in Libya is a disgrace.</p>
      <p sl="ro">What is even more outrageous is that we need to realise that this penalty is being applied, in very many cases, to foreigners in Libya. Information about the recent execution of 18 people indicates that they included Egyptians, Nigerians and Chadians. Why is the punishment much harsher for these people? The reason for this, unfortunately, is that their basic rights are not respected during trials, by which I mean in terms of having access to translators and also consular assistance, which is an absolute must according to international norms.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission subscribes to the views expressed by honourable Members in the various motions regarding the recent executions of 18 people in Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission condemns executions as they are in contradiction with our values. We consider capital punishment to be cruel and inhumane, failing to deter criminal behaviour and representing an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is particularly disturbed by the fact that these executions have taken place just weeks after Libya was elected to be a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. In this context, the EU, in conformity with the EU guidelines on the death penalty, has made a démarche towards the Libyan authorities to express our condemnation and to remind Libya of its legal obligation – contained in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Libya on 15 May 1970 – to provide all possible safeguards to ensure a fair trial.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this démarche the EU has also encouraged Libya to establish a moratorium with a view to considering the abolition of the death penalty for all crimes. The Commission is committed to continuing the policy of engagement with Libya that the Council has decided. In this context, the conclusion of the framework agreement between the EU and Libya will provide the legal basis for establishing a regular dialogue and cooperation on all human rights issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Negotiations on the framework agreement are progressing well. The seventh round of negotiations took place last week in Tripoli and the Commission can report that good progress has been made, especially regarding political issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion let me stress that the Commission is fully aware that certain topics are problematic in relations with Libya. Nonetheless, the Commission is committed to developing the EU-Libya dialogue further on the basis of mutual trust in order to be able to address all issues in an open and constructive manner, including very sensitive ones as in this case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Libya has shown its strong will to deepen relations with the EU. While considering this very positive, the Commission intends to put these relations on the basis of a growing respect for fundamental values and rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Since the dialogue with the Libyan authorities was resumed in 2003, Libya has continued to send worrying signals to the European Union and the international community. Our resolution lists the recent moves made by an authoritarian regime that has made no significant progress with regard to respect for human rights, the democratisation of the state or the modernisation of the judicial system. The execution of 18 people on 30 May 2010 is another sad demonstration of the Libyan authorities’ refusal to respect the rights and values to which the EU is firmly attached and on which it was founded. The closure of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ordered arbitrarily by those same authorities, is confirmation of their disdain for international institutions. We therefore need to say clearly to Libya that the EU will not support the kind of foreign policy that seeks to discredit international law and use the international democratic arena solely for propaganda purposes. In this context, the European Parliament must be fully informed of the status of negotiations between the EU and Libya so that we can evaluate the acceptable level of cooperation with Libya and demand the change and progress that will restore mutual trust.</p>
