    <intervention id="2-009-000" speaker_id="97199" name="Crescenzio Rivellini" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, the Council has again made a request for urgent procedure on this file, for which I have been appointed rapporteur, asking Parliament to deliver its opinion during the Committee on Fisheries meeting of December 2011. As rapporteur, and on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I oppose the Council’s request for urgent procedure, as happened previously for the same request on 15 November 2011. I also think there is a need to summarise the problem again briefly.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council’s proposal concerns access by fishing vessels flying the flag of Venezuela to the exclusive economic zone off the coast of the French department of Guiana. As the title suggests, the proposal is similar to an international agreement in respect of which, under the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has the right to act as colegislator in the ordinary legislative procedure.</p>
      <p sl="it">The draft does not present any problems are far as the substance is concerned. There is every reason to approve this draft, which, although signed unilaterally by the Council, will, under international law, impose obligations on the parties involved that are similar to those imposed under an ordinary fisheries agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">The main issue, however, lies elsewhere. The Commission forwarded the proposal to Parliament with a particular legal basis: Articles 43(2) and 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament fully accepted the proposal in view of its content and spirit, recognising as it did Parliament’s power of consent. When the Council later referred the matter to Parliament, however, it had unilaterally changed the legal basis, setting aside Articles 43(2) and 218(6)(a) and opting for Articles 43(3) and 218(6)(b) instead, meaning that Parliament could merely deliver an opinion.</p>
      <p sl="it">I recall that at that point, the coordinators of our committee rejected the change made by the Council and, before adopting any definitive position, referred the file to Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs. The latter committee confirmed the validity of the legal basis initially used by the Commission and made a point of warning the Committee on Fisheries about the dangerous precedent that the combination of Articles 43(3) and 218(6)(b) of the Treaty could set.</p>
      <p sl="it">As the Council is keen to obtain just Parliament’s opinion and not its consent as soon as possible, the Chair of the Committee on Fisheries, Ms Fraga Estévez, wrote to President Buzek on 5 October 2011 informing him of the stances of the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Legal Affairs, suggesting that, in order to avoid any controversy, he invite the Council to refer the matter to Parliament again, this time in a draft containing the original legal basis, thereby reinstating Parliament in its rightful place as colegislator.</p>
      <p sl="it">President Buzek wrote to the Council on 26 October 2011 to that effect. In its reply, the Council merely – I repeat, merely – writes as follows: the Council’s decision to change the legal basis initially used by the Commission was not taken lightly but resulted from careful consideration.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not find this reply at all satisfactory. When the Committee on Fisheries meets on 20 December, therefore, Parliament has a duty to vote for the draft report that restores the appropriate legal basis. It is vital that Parliament rejects this proposal.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Herman Van Rompuy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, dear colleagues, I want to report to you today on the main outcomes of last week’s European Council. As you know, the main focus was on the future of the eurozone. It is a long route. Restoring confidence is more difficult than most of us expected. It has taken huge efforts to remedy the weak infrastructure provided by the Maastricht Treaty and to correct the policies of the past.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the meeting, there was, on the one hand, a remarkable degree of consensus on the content and objectives. This agreement on the substance was moreover supported not only by the eurozone members but also by the future eurozone members. On the other hand, there was more discussion on the legal instruments necessary. Allow me to start with the former, lest it be overlooked because of controversy about the latter.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, for the short term, we agreed on immediate action to help overcome the current difficulties. We are increasing our financial resources to address the crisis we face. The euro area and other Member States will aim to make available additional resources of up to EUR 200 billion to the International Monetary Fund. The leverage of the European Financial Stability Facility will be rapidly deployed at the European Central Bank, and the European Central Bank will act as its agent in market operations. The entry into force of the European Stability Mechanism rescue fund will be accelerated so that it can start in July 2012. In March, we will review the overall adequacy of the EFSF/ESM ceiling of EUR 500 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards private sector involvement, the major change to our doctrine that we decided on 21 July will now be translated into the ESM Treaty. Or, to put it more bluntly, our first approach to PSI, which had a very negative impact on the debt markets, is now officially over. From now on, we will strictly adhere to the IMF principles and practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, as regards the medium and longer term, we agreed on a new fiscal compact with new fiscal rules. Member States will transpose it into their national legislation at constitutional or equivalent level. Our rules on excessive deficit procedure will become more automatic for the euro area members and key elements of this new approach are the following: first, building on the Stability and Growth Pact, budgets must be balanced in structural terms – that is, over the economic cycle; second, that rule must be defined at treaty level and incorporated into national rules; third, automatic adjustment mechanisms to ensure correction in case of deviation must be defined by the Member States on the basis of principles proposed by the Commission; four, bringing revised QMV to decide on Commission proposals at the very beginning of the excessive deficit procedure so that this will apply throughout the procedure. Besides that, as agreed in October, Member States under an excessive deficit procedure will have to submit their draft budgetary plans before adoption to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, there was a broad agreement on the substance. As regards the form, everybody agreed that these new commitments should be made binding, but there were different views as to how this could be done. As you know, I put on the table an interim report on strengthening economic and monetary union, which evaluated what we have done so far, identified weaknesses and suggested various ways in which these vulnerabilities could be addressed. These ways ranged from decisions that can be taken in the context of the existing Treaties, to a possible revision of Protocol 12 by means of a decision of the European Council, to fully-fledged treaty changes by means of either the simplified or the ordinary revision procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of the decisions that can be taken on the basis of the existing Treaties were agreed. However, the possibility of revising Protocol 12 and the option of amending the Treaties both require unanimity. It became clear in the course of the meeting that such unanimity was not forthcoming. Faced with this fact – and I feel no need to be controversial myself on this – there was no alternative but to go down the route of a separate treaty among the 17 eurozone members, though open to others. Indeed, almost all of the other members, even those with a derogation on joining the euro, have now announced that they will join in this process, subject to consulting their parliaments. It was a moment of responsibility and solidarity. The European interest was at stake and the European interest has to be our only criterion.</p>
      <p sl="en">An intergovernmental treaty was not my first preference, nor that of most Member States. However, it will make the fiscal compact binding. It must be negotiated as a matter of urgency. It will not be easy, also legally speaking. I count on everybody to be constructive, bearing in mind what is at stake. Our aim is to strengthen both fiscal discipline and economic coordination, going beyond what we have already achieved in the ‘six-pack’.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will not be the first time that more engaged Member States have proceeded by agreement among themselves, without waiting for all to join the new initiative. It was the case with Schengen, with police cooperation and in terms of implementing the launch of the euro itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Importantly, we agreed that the European Parliament will be associated in this process.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the calendar, rather rapidly, following consultations with national parliaments, we should know the number of participating states. I am optimistic because I know it is going to be very close to 27. In fact, 26 leaders indicated their interest in this effort. They recognise that the euro is a common good. Then, in early March at the latest, the ‘Fiscal Compact’ Treaty will be signed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective remains to incorporate these provisions into the EU Treaties as soon as possible. In the meantime, we must ensure that the new procedures remain as closely embedded in the Union’s structure as possible. There is indeed considerable leeway to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Besides this, the existing draft of last year’s ESM Treaty will be amended in the coming days. It will integrate yesterday’s important decision on changing our approach to private sector involvement and our ideas on softening the unanimity rule. The aim is for the ESM Treaty to be ratified by mid-2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">In March, I will report to the European Council on deepening fiscal integration, as already indicated in the interim report I drew up in close cooperation with the President of the European Commission and the President of the Euro Group.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we called on the European Parliament and the Council, under the ordinary legislative procedure, rapidly to examine the Commission’s proposals of 23 November so that they can be in force in time for the next budget cycle.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council discussed other issues that are also of importance, even if they were overshadowed by the economic governance issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">On enlargement, following the consent of the European Parliament, we signed the Accession Treaty with Croatia, thus paving the way for Croatia to become the 28th Member State of the Union. We reconfirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkans, making clear that our door will not close behind Croatia.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, the European Council identified clear objectives and a clear timeframe for Serbia and for Montenegro. Both countries have made remarkable progress on their way to the European Union. Serbia has taken bold steps to bring Europe’s most wanted war criminals to international justice. The Belgrade-Pristina dialogue has brought about initial results and implementation of those agreements is moving forward. We now expect Serbia to build on that dialogue and to improve relations with Pristina with the aim of the Council granting Serbia the status of candidate country in February next year, to be confirmed by the European Council at the beginning of March 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Montenegro received candidate status a year ago and has undertaken many domestic reforms, which now need to be fully implemented. We will continue to assess Montenegro’s progress, especially in the area of the rule of law, and aim to open the accession negotiations in June 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">Coming back to the eurozone, confidence that has gone cannot be restored overnight. It is a long way, but this European Council is an important building block on this way.</p>

    <intervention id="2-014-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission’s fundamental point of departure for last week’s European Council was crystal clear: the European Union needed to give a comprehensive response to the current crisis, making a firm commitment to the euro and to the irreversibility of our currency.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is indispensable to have more discipline, structural reforms for more investment, more convergence, and credible mechanisms of solidarity. All these elements belong together.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the past 18 months, we have achieved some progress within the European Union as a whole, at 27, on the basis of the existing Treaties, with the European Union institutions taking the decisions. As a result, we now have a European strategy for growth and employment: Europe 2020. We have a substantially reinforced Stability and Growth Pact, with the ‘six-pack’, which will come into force today and will apply to all 27 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have the European Semester, through which we coordinate our fiscal and macro-economic policies and implement our agenda for growth on an annual basis. We also have the new macro-economic imbalances procedure. There is also the Euro Plus Pact.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are two brand new Commission proposals, made on 23 November, under Article 136, on further strengthening fiscal discipline, which I hope will be adopted in a fast-track procedure through an early first reading agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have our assistance and adjustment programmes, including those for three euro area Member States. There is the European Central Bank playing its role, there is the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and there will be the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).</p>
      <p sl="en">The main purpose of this European Council was to show our joint determination to tackle persisting market tensions by consolidating these achievements and reinforcing them even further. Indeed, during Thursday night, an agreement was reached to create a genuine ‘fiscal stability union’, a new ‘fiscal compact’.</p>
      <p sl="en">On substance, this agreement was ambitious, and it was unanimous. Unfortunately, it was not unanimous on the form, with one Member State unable to join. I will come back to both aspects – substance and form – in a moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me first highlight a number of important conclusions of the summit which match the position that the Commission has taken for some time.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome, first of all, the fact that Member States have agreed to advance to July 2012 the entry into force of the permanent European Stability Mechanism. As you know, I had already suggested precisely this in September during the State of the Union debate before this House. I also welcome the fact that Member States have now finally agreed to deal properly with the involvement of the private sector, with the ESM applying the same principles as the IMF. The Commission has always warned of the possible negative effects of PSI on market confidence. The decision now taken should reassure investors.</p>
      <p sl="en">An agreement also emerged that the ESM should not, as was initially planned, be subject to the rule of unanimity. Decisions will now be taken by reinforced qualified majority. Here again, I had proposed this already for the EFSF, but without success. So I am happy to see that now, for the ESM, things are going in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">More immediately, leveraging of the EFSF will be deployed very rapidly, with the ECB acting as its agent in the EFSF market operations. I hope that Member States will confirm their commitment to provide the IMF with additional resources of up to EUR 200 billion within the coming days.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now need to go further. The spring European Council in March will discuss how to further deepen fiscal integration of the euro area on the basis of a report by the President of the European Council, together with the President of the Commission and the President of the Euro Group.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s Green Paper on European stability bonds of 23 November will feed into this debate. As you know, this is very controversial for some governments. Nevertheless, I was encouraged to see support for our assessment that stability bonds can make an important contribution in the future to completing a fiscal stability union and creating a stronger liquid bonds market in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to go further on growth, on investment, and on measures to promote jobs. Fiscal discipline is of course key, but – let us be frank about this – we cannot build our economic union just on discipline and sanctions. We also need a Europe of growth and of jobs. A Europe of responsibility, certainly, but also a Europe of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now move on to the key elements of the new fiscal compact.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, it includes a commitment to ensure that, as a general rule, national budgets will be balanced at least, and that such balance is defined as the annual structural deficit not exceeding 0.5% of GDP. To give this national debt brake or ‘golden rule’ maximum legal effect, Member States commit to enshrining it at constitutional or equivalent level. The Court of Justice will have competence to review proper transposition of this commitment. This is a sound foundation for sustainable medium- to long-term fiscal policies and a strong signal to the markets that European governments are serious about their new ‘stability culture’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the excessive deficit procedure under Article 126 of the Treaty, which, as you know, applies to all 27 Member States, will apply in a stricter way for the euro area Member States. In future, the euro area Member States will commit to accepting true automaticity for triggering the deficit procedure from the moment when a Member State breaches its commitment to reduce deficits. The same automaticity will apply throughout the whole procedure for any ensuing steps proposed by the Commission, including the preventive arm. Only a qualified majority against the Commission proposal would be able to stop the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new commitment will add to the ‘six-pack’ automaticity for which this House fought so hard. It will put the Commission at the heart of ensuring fiscal discipline, in line with your position. We will accept this increased responsibility knowing that its democratic legitimacy derives from this House and that it is here that we will be held accountable for our objectiveness and our resolve.</p>
      <p sl="en">All in all, the agreement on substance at this summit is quite impressive.</p>
      <p sl="en">But frankly, we cannot say the same on form. The reason why it took until 5 a.m. on Friday morning to reach this agreement was not the substance, but was mainly the form. The debate was on whether this should happen through a revision of the European Union Treaties, involving all 27 Member States and all the European Union institutions, or should it be outside this framework, with a new treaty? As you know, in the interim report presented to the Heads of State or Government, the President of the European Council, together with the President of the Euro Group and myself, tabled proposals in line with a treaty revision involving all 27 Member States and all the European institutions. Personally, I made every possible effort to agree this fiscal compact fully within the current Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach required that all 27 Member States played their part. As you know, one Member State was opposed to amending the Lisbon Treaty. The United Kingdom, in exchange for giving its agreement, asked for a specific protocol on financial services which, as presented, was a risk to the integrity of the internal market. This made compromise impossible. All the other Heads of State or Government were left with the choice between paying this price or moving ahead without the UK’s participation and accepting an international agreement among themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">In search of compromise, I tabled a clause providing, in the European Union Treaties, that any measures adopted by the Council and applying to the euro area only must not undermine the internal market, including in financial services, nor constitute discrimination between the euro area Member States and the others. Unfortunately, this compromise proved impossible and so it was not possible to have a solution that could allow all 27 Member States to agree in the framework of the current Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="en">On a more positive note, I must also say that I was encouraged by the resolve of almost all the Member States to have more, not less, integration, to make more, and not less, use of the Community method and the European institutions, and to work for more, and not less, coherence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most Member States made it clear that they do not want to circumvent the Community method and the European institutions. They do not want to diminish the executive role of the Commission nor the prerogatives of this Parliament. The agreement will not replace Union institutions and procedures but will, on the contrary, build on them. And at my request, they have made a clear commitment to integrating the agreement fully into European Union law as soon as possible. This will need to be strongly reflected in the legal text now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will do all it can so that this agreement is legally safe and institutionally acceptable. The Commission will contribute to these negotiations as Guardian of the European Union Treaties and of our institutional model.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me be clear: the Commission will not accept any intergovernmental treaty that would be in conflict with Union law. I will take a direct interest in this question and I am sure Parliament will do so as well. In fact, I expect that Parliament will also be associated with these negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, you may ask, how can we square the circle concretely? How can we progress by way of an international agreement, without eroding the Community method?</p>
      <p sl="en">This point will require our utmost attention and our joint scrutiny over the next days and weeks. In my view, the best way of doing it is to follow a basic principle: the agreement should contain stronger national commitments, but the European Union institutions should act exclusively on the basis of the European Union Treaties. Thus, we will apply the European Union’s monitoring and correction system as reinforced by the ‘six-pack’, and there will be no other parallel or competing structures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission, acting pursuant to the European Union Treaties, will monitor how Member States have been living up to their additional commitments made in this agreement. I intend to make full use of Article 136, by proposing to this House all the legislation that will be needed to make this construction work, to tie this fiscal compact back to European Union law and to buttress it with the democratic legitimacy of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fortunately, we have not seen a split of the European Union between the 17 and the other ten. This was the greatest risk ahead of the summit. This is not an agreement at 17 plus, but an agreement at 27 minus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last week, most Heads of State or Government of the Member States showed their readiness to move ahead with European integration, towards a fiscal stability union. They showed that they want more Europe, not less.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, this was not the only subject at the European Council: some other important issues were also discussed last week, such as the annual growth survey, enlargement and energy. I will come back to these tomorrow when we will assess the results of the European Union’s work during the Polish Presidency of the Council. At this moment, I just want to highlight the historic agreement that was signed for Croatia to join our Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is indeed very important that Member States agreed on a fiscal compact, but let me say that this is not enough. The problems in the euro area are not only fiscal but also financial, and, above all, problems related to lack of competitiveness. We need to restore growth and promote employment. The commitment to fiscal discipline is indispensable for Europe, but the reality is that structural reforms for competitiveness and growth-enhancing measures are the key to restoring not only the confidence of investors but also, above all, the confidence of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why I insist on the need to pursue the comprehensive approach that the Commission has presented in our road map for stability and growth. I hope Parliament and the Member States will support this line and work together for the deepening of the internal market, including the rapid implementation of existing commitments on services, energy, innovation, the digital agenda and free trade agreements, and for swift adoption of pending proposals to enhance growth, such as support for SMEs, better regulation, tax initiatives, fast-tracking proposals, especially those that extend the benefits of the Single Market, and, last but not least, targeted investment at European Union level, including through project bonds. Yes, we need investment at European level, and that is why our MFF proposal – and, for instance, the Connecting Europe Facility addressing the issue of the missing links in networks – is so relevant for Europe’s growth and employment prospects.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I wish to highlight that, even if today, attention is turned elsewhere, green growth remains key to employment in Europe. This is why I welcome the conclusions from Durban, with all major emitters agreeing for the first time to have a new comprehensive and binding legal instrument which will include limits on CO2 emissions. This was only possible because of the leadership from the European Union: I am very proud of the role of the Commission in this matter. This shows that, with consistence and coherent efforts, Europe is able to put its mark on global agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same kind of coherence and persistence will now be needed for implementation of the growth agenda for the European Union. This is exactly what our citizens expect from us: a Europe of responsibility, yes, but also a Europe of solidarity; a Europe of stability, yes, but also a Europe of growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council opened the way, last Thursday and Friday, to governance of the euro area. It showed that the period of waiting, uncertainty and divisions is now behind us and that an end to the crisis is finally in sight.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Twenty-six out of 27 States have demonstrated their desire to revert to a healthy finance policy by establishing strict rules allowing for a return to balanced budgets and a reduction in public debt, and by agreeing to incorporate those rules in their constitutions and ensuring that any instances of non-compliance are punished.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Twenty-six out of 27 States have shown a sense of responsibility by ensuring that their main political and economic decisions are taken jointly, and by developing crisis mechanisms to be implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB). Twenty-six out of 27 States have conceded that shared sovereignty is preferable to sovereignty held hostage by markets. In short, the spirit of cooperation has prevailed over the attempt to create divisions. Determination has proved stronger than indecision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Three major issues still need to be resolved: that of the nature of the new agreement, that of the United Kingdom’s place in Europe and the attitude of the 26 towards it, and, finally, that of the crucial ‘growth’ strand of our economic policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, since the United Kingdom has refused to support the decision taken by its counterparts, the resulting project is not a Community one, as we were hoping, and as I have often said, but an intergovernmental one. This situation presents us with a number of problems, not only legal problems, but political problems, too. My group calls for the European institutions to be fully involved in the discussions that will culminate in the drafting of the new provisions between now and March, and, in particular, for Parliament to be accorded its rightful place in this process so that it can ensure its democratic legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I solemnly call upon Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso to work closely with the European Parliament. We must ensure, in fact, that no radical changes are made to the spirit and the letter of what has been done for the last 60 years and what has made European integration the success that it is. Cohesion must continue to prevail over power struggles, something which only the Community method can ensure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second major issue raised by the decision of 9 December concerns the United Kingdom’s place in Europe, and I will come to this. I respect the decisions that were made but, clearly, the UK’s isolation shows that its government sees the European Union as nothing but a free trade area, and that it has no interest in showing solidarity with, and acting responsibly towards, its partners. To my mind, this calls for a change in behaviour towards the country by the 26 and also, to some extent, within the European institutions. In particular, I believe that the UK rebate should be called into question, since the resources of our fellow citizens should be used for something other than rewarding selfish, nationalist attitudes. Solidarity is not a one-way street. It is time Mr Cameron’s coalition government was made to realise that and was reminded of its obligations, in particular, with regard to the financial regulation rules from which it even requested an exemption, which fortunately was refused.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third and final issue relates to the ‘growth and employment’ strand of our economic policy. Of course, there will be no growth unless we put our public accounts in order, but the Union must now set about strengthening and developing its industrial activities, exports and competitiveness with the same level of energy and coordination. Indeed, Europe will not resolve the crisis permanently without a radical two-pronged approach consisting of sound management, on the one hand, and growth, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as Parliament is concerned, I believe that we need to work closely with the Commission, on the basis of the proposals it made two months ago. I believe that we must do so, Mr President, in order to overcome the crisis, and that we must vote by a very large majority in February.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is what I propose as ‘homework’ for the Christmas holiday, and on that note, I wish all of you and your families a very happy Christmas.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Mr President, it sounded in Mr Daul’s speech as if he was making a threat to the United Kingdom. Perhaps the translators got it wrong. Can you confirm, Mr Daul, that in your speech as Chairman of the EPP Group and on behalf of the EPP Group, that you were indeed threatening that the United Kingdom’s well deserved rebate be reduced or taken away? Can you confirm that you did indeed make that threat?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I clearly said that, if, as I believe, the United Kingdom has given up on showing solidarity with the other 26 States for now, then I do not see why the 26 should make a further concession regarding the budget. Let me be quite clear: this is not a declaration of war; it is simply about ensuring that solidarity is shown between everyone and not just one way. That is all!</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the statements from the Council and the results of the Council meeting from Mr Van Rompuy and also from Mr Barroso. Let us now talk about what really happened. The announcement that this Council meeting would bring stability to the markets was wrong. The reaction of the so-called markets over recent days does not show any signs of stability. There was no response concerning the role of the European Central Bank, which was a controversial topic before this Council meeting. Nothing at all was said on the subject of a pact for growth, employment and stability in Europe based on job creation. The answer to the problem of financing the crisis countries, which will have to make several hundred billion euro available on the markets in the first three months of next year, and which currently have bond spreads of more than 7%, was wrong.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is happening with the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)? Why is it being brought forward? What will happen in the period before it comes into force? Will it be granted a banking licence? There was no answer to any of these questions. Do you call this a stability union? Now we come to the behaviour of the United Kingdom. We have given urgent warnings about even starting a debate on the Treaty, because it is obvious to everyone that if you start the debate on the Treaty, there will be attempts at blackmail involving a commitment to agree to Treaty reform only if a certain price is paid. What price did the British Prime Minister demand? An opt-out from the Working Time Directive, that is absolutely clear, and no further regulation of the financial markets. This is the price we would have to pay. I believe the fact that the other 26 states were not prepared to pay this price is a good sign. We cannot be blackmailed into introducing no more regulation by the very people who have pushed us into this severe financial market crisis, in other words, the financial markets themselves and the speculators in the City of London. That is not acceptable.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I had expected, Mr Van Rompuy, that you would say something to us about the European Parliament. ‘The involvement of the European Parliament’ was the only sentence in which you mentioned it. I was expecting a little more. Therefore, I would like you to answer two specific questions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, is it correct that the Council has agreed to set up a Euro++ group consisting of the 17 euro countries, plus the countries which want to join, in the form of a working group chaired by you and including the European Parliament? If that is not the case, please tell us. If it is the case, I would like to ask you why you are not saying so. Mr Barroso, you want to fast track your proposals of 23 November. You can do that, but I must say to you that Parliament can only tackle this legislation with you on one condition, and that is if there is a guarantee that in all the subsequent stages, the European Parliament will sit at the table as the third partner, together with the Council and the Commission. Otherwise, I can only recommend to Parliament not to become involved in any subsequent stages.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">We are hearing constant institutional debates and constant reflections as to how we can extricate ourselves from the mess which we have got ourselves into by taking temporary measures under the terms of the Treaty. Every time, and I have to say this once again and it is also directed at you, Mr Barroso, we are told that we need to regain the confidence of the markets. Whoever these markets might be, and I prefer to talk about speculators, banks, insurance companies and large fund investors, rather than markets, their interest lies only in maximising their capital. Are they really the people whose confidence we need to regain? No! How would it be if we were to discuss how we can finally regain the confidence of the people of Europe in the European Union?</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">As the parliamentary representatives of the citizens of Europe, we must guarantee that this happens. Therefore, I would like to say once again in conclusion that we in the European Parliament would be well advised, and I believe that my fellow Members will agree with me, when we sit together with the other institutions in Mr Van Rompuy’s working group between now and March, to make some alternative proposals of our own as to how we can create stability in the European Union, most importantly by supporting growth, employment and social security for the people of Europe. There will be no market-based democracy. What we need is a market which is subject to democratic rules and these rules must be drawn up and enacted here in the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am going to speak in my native language, because, on this particular day, English does not seem to be the appropriate language to use. It took Belgium more than 540 days to form a government and everyone poked fun at us. However, the euro crisis has been going on for more than 700 days and we, here, need to have the honesty to recognise that we have still not got it under control and that the end is still not in sight.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I believe that we ought, above all, to underline the positive aspects of the recent summit, something which has yet to be done here. One of those is that we have finally abandoned and thrown out the accursed, disastrous Deauville deal. That, you will remember, was the casino compromise. The deal that was the spawn of President Sarkozy’s obsession and Prime Minister Merkel’s kiss of death. The obsession of Mr Sarkozy, who thought – and, I believe, still thinks – that he and the large euro area countries should be the ones running the show, not the European institutions, not the European Commission. That is an illusion which has now been banished once and for all, and that is good, because it will put an end to the impunity which France and Germany granted themselves, back in 2003, to refuse to apply the rules whenever they themselves breached them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In my view, another positive aspect of last Friday’s summit is that we have also got rid of Ms Merkel’s kiss of death, namely, the idea that private investors in government bonds should take their cut of the profits. Obviously, that idea sounded fine and it went down well here, in this House, too, but, in reality, as Mr Trichet indicated previously, that has cost us billions of euro and has only made the euro crisis worse. We ought to be pleased that this summit has achieved that. There were two people who came out of the summit with a broad smile on their face: Mr Sarkozy and Ms Merkel. Why exactly were they smiling? Because we put an end to the deal that they forged a year earlier. That has been the outcome of this summit.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Will that be enough, though? Will this spell the return of American, Asian and European investors who have offloaded large quantities of European countries’ government bonds in recent days and weeks? Will they again start investing in the shares of European financial institutions, mostly French financial institutions which themselves have government bond portfolios? Well, I have my doubts. Could this agreement be enough to stop the haemorrhage? Sadly, I believe that it will not be enough to restore confidence in the euro.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Why so, you may ask. The fact is that the European Council has addressed only one aspect of the problem, that of budgetary discipline; we are still playing catch-up with the facts and, yet, refusing to take up the solidarity aspect with the government leaders. Ladies and gentlemen, a monetary union is not only about discipline, it is also about solidarity. It works the other way around, too: it is not only about solidarity, but about discipline, too. Discipline without solidarity means that you do not have a Union at all and solidarity without discipline creates a bottomless money pit.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, from this day forward, we cannot afford to hesitate. The crisis must be addressed across the board and in depth. Let us be honest about it and recognise that the Council does not have the competence to achieve that. The Council has already met on so many occasions over the last two years, and, yet, each time it has come up with halfway measures. I believe that we, as Parliament, should take the lead here; it is we who need to mark out the road that will lead us out of the crisis. We need to ask the Commission to work with the European Parliament over the coming weeks to put an overall approach on the table, that of the Council and that of Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally some words in English to our British friends. I think that after a few nights, David Cameron will also come to the conclusion that he made the blunder of a lifetime. If Mr Cameron really wants to obtain additional guarantees for the City, he needs to be at the negotiation table. Why? Because in politics, there is one golden rule: you only walk away if you are sure that the others will come after you to win you back. That is the reality. Kohl and Mitterrand did it with Mrs Thatcher. To use an English expression for our British friends: When you are invited to the table, it is either as a guest or you are part of the menu. Dear colleagues, that can happen now.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is nice that we can still find something to laugh about, even in the midst of the crisis. While I watched events unfolding last Friday at the summit in Brussels – in the European Parliament’s traditional role that we are now supposed to continue playing in future – I had the impression that, in comparison with the way in which the crisis has developed, this summit has nothing whatsoever to do with the crisis as it appears to us at the moment. Greece, whose problems have not been resolved after years of debate, and now several older European countries are threatened by state bankruptcy. In the opinion of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Union is on the brink of or has perhaps even started to enter a recession. My experience of this summit is that it is a summit of total denial.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not just referring to Mr Cameron. Like everyone else, I thought it was good that he was pushed into a corner. We can no longer put up with the British strategy of self-interest and protecting the City, which Mr Schulz has rightly described as one of the roots of all the problems that we now have to deal with. However, while Mr Cameron stood in the corner which he had chosen for himself, the question remained: what now? This is where the denial continued. I saw a denial of reality and at its heart lay, in my opinion, a narrow-minded and irresponsible analysis of the crisis by Ms Merkel.</p>
      <p sl="de">She maintains that sovereign debt is the problem and that it is the sole and central problem which has caused this crisis. Therefore, her only response is to say that austerity policies are the means by which we will emerge from the crisis. I cannot bear this any more, because the situation we are in today is the result of this one-sided austerity mentality which the Germans have imposed on the entire European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we expected was a sign of resilient European solidarity. Contrary to the advice of the economic experts in Germany, not a single word has been said about a debt redemption fund. The banking licence for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) was not a topic for discussion. That is not acceptable, because we must put ourselves in the position where we can give a central guarantee for European government bonds, a subject which the Poles talked about during their Council Presidency until they were blue in the face. The banking licence for the EFSF would be the simple and obvious way of achieving this. However, it was refused, as were measures to combat the recession. Whenever I hear your old story, Mr Barroso, about sustainable development in the European Union, and I have been hearing it since the time of the Lisbon strategy, I ask myself where and how it will finally come about. It was not discussed at this summit.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms Merkel was defeated on the subject of creditor participation. We can have a dispute about this, but it no longer exists, despite the fact that Ms Merkel fought for it so strongly. If there is no creditor participation, the question which I believe is still outstanding is the entire issue of justice. We must not jointly take on the burdens imposed by the crisis while those people who benefited from our debts before and during the crisis and whose assets are actually our debts emerge from the crisis completely unscathed.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">One important topic for discussion is how we can involve the wealthy people in future if there is no creditor participation.</p>
      <p sl="de">The summit failed to meet its objectives. It was a summit which involved a denial of reality and of democracy. We were not given any answers to the serious questions of the crisis, but we did get an announcement which ran contrary to European democracy. I find it unbearable that during the crisis, we are being fobbed off with piecemeal measures like this intergovernmental stability treaty which is being put alongside the European Treaties, whatever that may mean. I am pleased that the chairs of the groups in Parliament decided yesterday to table a resolution in January in which we will explain the responses that can be made to the crisis now without Treaty change. I believe that the economy and solidarity union which I and my group would like to see will not be possible if the Treaty is not changed. However, everything I have mentioned that must be done in response to the crisis is also possible without changing the Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we can hardly call it a success. We have seen another emergency measure which aims to restore fiscal stability – definitely a step in the right direction, but not sufficient. We have not seen any proposals on how to restore economic growth in Europe and we have seen Europe more divided that ever before in an unprecedented way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you are still talking about 26 and I do not think that any of you are entitled to speak on behalf of 26. So please stop it, it is not true. None of you are entitled to speak for 26 member countries. We have 17 eurozone countries and even those are divided into two parts – those who will pay and those who will be paid. I am sorry for Germany, The Netherlands, Austria and Finland – guys, you will pay a whole lot of money and your taxpayers will probably thank you very much for that. Then we have of course nine non-eurozone countries that might or might not join the plan. This is still under question and some of them might be very reluctant.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course there is the issue of the United Kingdom, which some of you decided to make a scapegoat for all that mess. I have to defend this country, because what Mr Cameron did was just a defence of his country’s national interest in the same way that Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel did. They pretend that they are speaking on behalf of Europe, but they are speaking on behalf of themselves only. So you have no reason to criticise the United Kingdom, nor its government.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think where we are now is very clear. We are in the situation of a multi-speed Europe. It is a reality. When times get hard, when times get tough, the Community method evaporates and we go into governmental. When we go into governmental, the Commission and Parliament are completely sidelined, and if we are going into governmental, there is an open question about the legal validity of that intergovernmental treaty or agreement – or whatever you call it – and its compatibility with EU primary law. But the truth is that we are in a situation of a multi-speed Europe and where we are now is a result of a misleading, ever-closer Union policy and a one-size-fits-all effort.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will pay economically very dearly for that. We will pay very dearly for that wrong ideologically-motivated strife to maintain the eurozone at any cost. I can only repeat that this is not the EU policy for the 21st century. You might like it or not, but if you do not get it, you might perhaps scrape through this crisis, but others will inevitably come and their consequences might be detrimental.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the EU summit was supposed to bring about a breakthrough in the process of resolving the international financial crisis. It has undoubtedly not succeeded in doing so, because too many issues have been ignored and there has been a one-sided focus on reducing public debt and budgetary supervision. Even much of this was very unspecific. It may have given us a breathing space, but nothing more.</p>
      <p sl="de">The much-talked-about confidence of the markets cannot be regained by imposing an austerity policy based on the German model. The causes of the financial crisis are varied in nature, but the failure of independent bodies and, most importantly, the political system to manage or monitor the unregulated financial markets is the decisive factor. If we apply this standard, it is clear that the leading politicians of the 27 EU Member States once again did not want or were unable to take action.</p>
      <p sl="de">Increasing the financial power of the instruments which are intended to prevent speculation by bringing forward by one year the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) that amounts to EUR 500 billion, by continuing in parallel with the European Financial Stability Facility, and by extending the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with EUR 200 billion, will only guarantee that the banks will have their loans repaid and make a healthy profit on the interest. This is how the governments of the euro countries want to play the game with the financial markets, but they forget that they are in the weaker position. Most importantly, the failed attempt to leverage the rescue funds demonstrates the power and the powerlessness of the policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The main opponent within the EU of regulating the international financial markets has gone into self-imposed isolation. Hopefully, decisive action will now be taken to tackle this problem, at least within the euro area and the EU Member States which want to join the euro. The first step must be to implement the international transaction tax quickly. Next, the most dangerous new financial products must simply be banned. This also applies to the activities of the shadow banks. The European Union can and must make progress and set an example in this area. If EU banks try to evade regulation in other parts of the world, they will be threatened with the removal of state rescue packages in the case of a crisis.</p>
      <p sl="de">Their business can ultimately be placed under state supervision or they can be nationalised. This would be an appropriate response to a systemic crisis. The consequences of the international crisis, which has been going on since 2008, are already unbearable for the vast majority of citizens. Young people’s plans for the future, provisions for the working population and the life’s work of millions of people have already been destroyed, with the most serious impact being felt, of course, in the crisis countries of Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy. However, the citizens of all EU countries are affected by the excessive austerity measures. They are the culmination of the neoliberal policy of deregulation and privatisation and the redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top. This policy over the last 15 years is what has taken us into the crisis and, therefore, it must be stopped and reversed.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can only ensure that public interests are served and that the welfare state is maintained by restraining blind market forces. Austerity measures will not stimulate growth and will not lead us out of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have often asked myself the question: why would a successful country that has enjoyed a thousand years of independence give up its right of self-government to the unelected nonentities that we see sitting before us this morning? The answer that comes back from the Foreign Office and the great and the good is that we must have influence in Europe. We must have a seat at the top table and we can change things. We have done our best to prove what good Europeans we are. We go on paying you GBP 50 million a day. We have helped the euro bailout fund, even though we did not join the currency, thank goodness. We have given you 80% of the fish stocks that swim in our waters – your fleets can come and take that from us – and we have applied every directive you have given us absolutely to the letter, all of it to gain influence.

He did not speak on behalf of the Labour Party, the Greens, the Liberals – well not all of the Liberals anyway. He certainly did not speak on behalf of the people of Scotland, with one representative at the Westminster Parliament from my country. He certainly did not speak on behalf of the aspirations of the Scottish Parliament.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Cameron stated in Westminster yesterday that only two options confronted him at last week’s summit: a new treaty without the negotiated safeguards for Britain or no treaty at all. He rightly chose no treaty. But with this failure, he left his and the Conservative Party’s EU policy in tatters. He mistakenly and naively promised the British people that he could repatriate powers from the EU, and that he could safeguard British interests. But such negotiations are not possible with the European Union, a Union that blatantly and negligently disregards sensible economic rules. You even broke your own rules in the Maastricht criteria just so that your beloved political project of European federalisation could move one step further. In your negligent actions, you cause financial hardship for people across Europe, people you constantly ignore in referendums. You deny them even the opportunity to have their say.</p>
      <p sl="en">To protect our interests, my country was right not to go along with your economic negligence. Even Ms Harms said that the summit denied reality and denied democracy. The British Prime Minister, having had his electoral pledge on renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU undermined and discredited, has finally faced up to the inevitable by refusing to have any part in the latest doomed rescue plan. Mr Cameron’s EU policy of negotiation is now in tatters and only a referendum on Britain’s future membership of the EU is a viable solution. Democratic integrity demands nothing less.

The fact that this includes balanced budgets, Ms Harms, does not mean that it constitutes an austerity policy and it is also nothing new. This forms part of the Treaty of Maastricht, but it has simply not been complied with.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point is that the United Kingdom must come to a decision. I see that Mr Farage has gone again. Mr Cameron has indeed isolated himself and he is not and will not become another Maggie Thatcher. He has completely miscalculated. The internal market is important for us and for everyone else. However, if someone says that they want a right of veto, this means that the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon no longer apply. The Treaty of Lisbon itself states that we make decisions on the basis of qualified majorities in the Council and in Parliament. What Mr Farage is calling for is also nothing new. It is simply compliance with the existing Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">The future EU Treaty will strengthen the euro area, but there must not be any parallel structures. Therefore, new rules are needed which also, in our opinion, must sooner or later be integrated into the Treaty of Lisbon. Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso, observer status is not enough for Parliament. We do not want to be fobbed off with the role of observer. Instead, we want to be involved in the changes to the Treaty and the rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">I noticed that Mr Schulz spoke about the financial markets, but neither he nor Mr Verhofstadt said anything about the content of the agreement. I read today in the newspapers that the French presidential candidate, Mr Hollande, is calling everything into question. He wants the European Central Bank (ECB), he wants Eurobonds, he wants a rescue fund, but he does not want a debt brake. I would like to have heard a statement from the chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament about what he will do if there is a different election result and his party colleague becomes president.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the conclusions of the European Council were not what we were expecting, given that the Treaty of Lisbon does, in fact, provide the elements and possible coverage to put forward credible solutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">We had called for Eurobonds and a financial transaction tax, an increase in the bail-out fund and a review of the role of the European Central Bank. As you yourselves have said this morning, however, nothing was decided on any of those points.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council’s response was budget discipline to curb the erosion of financial resources, but without investing in growth. This was a meagre outcome based on an agreement among 26 countries, reached after a tortuous procedure, which we have always rejected.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, by excluding the Commission and the European Parliament, the Council chose to add a democracy deficit to the budget deficit.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have a two-speed Europe, Mr President: the Europe of the Member States and the Europe of the people. Parliament supports the Europe of the people, and I call on President Barroso to have the Commission side with us.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am rather surprised. This morning on the German radio station Deutschlandfunk , Mr Schulz was celebrating the agreement on the ‘six-pack’ as the hour in which the European Parliament demonstrated its importance and I completely agree with him about this. However, he failed to mention that the left wing of this House did, of course, vote against the ‘six-pack’ and has now also taken up a position opposing the results of the summit, balanced budgets and effective sanctions. This does not add up. I am sorry, but we have a debt union. We must have balanced budgets. We need sensible mechanisms which will allow us to achieve this. That is what was decided at the summit. In overall terms, the results are an effective way of allowing us to move from being a debt union to becoming a stability union.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, on one point I agree with him and my other fellow Members: this will become a government agreement. As a result, the risk of a democratic deficit and of a lack of acceptance by the citizens is very real. Therefore, it is very important that the parliaments, both this House and the national parliaments, are very closely involved in this process.</p>
      <p sl="de">My third point, Mr Barroso, concerns something that is important to me. Of course it is essential that what is decided in this fiscal compact is transferred into the Treaties. To do this, we just need the agreement of the United Kingdom at some point. However, it may possibly be the case that we will be forced to do things the other way round. We may need to see this fiscal compact as the founding of a new European Union, as closer integration and as the starting signal for a new project. Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we want the British to be involved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Daul, the countries where Liberal parties are in government are those where the public finances are largely in good shape: Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Sweden. These are the countries where the Liberals are in government. In the countries where the Conservatives are in power without Liberals to apply corrective measures, such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, things look a little different. The Liberal position is very clear in that respect.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, there are two democratic institutions in Europe: the Council, which represents the Heads of State or Government, who have been elected, and the European Parliament, which is elected by universal suffrage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For two years, the Council has had sole responsibility for resolving the crisis, and for two years, it has failed. It has failed every quarter by holding another last-chance summit. I will see you in another three months at the next last-chance summit, because last week’s summit completely failed to resolve the issues that were on the table.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When you listen to the rating agencies – the infamous financial markets that you are keen to reassure – what do they say? They do not say, ‘more austerity, more discipline’. They say, ‘a comprehensive package including budgetary discipline’. No one is disputing the fact that we need to adopt this approach, but it is just one aspect of the package, not the only one. We are well aware that, today, with this package, with the outcome of this summit, you have added to the citizens’ concerns without even reassuring the markets. In other words, it is a complete waste of time. I shall see you again in three months’ time!</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, there is a second European institution that is democratic, namely the European Parliament. As Mr Schulz, Mr Daul and Ms Harms said, it is our responsibility to recognise today that we need to take the lead in establishing an alternative crisis plan, one that offers a different approach from that of the Council, which is all about failure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is our responsibility not just to vote on a resolution, but to use all the powers bestowed on us by the Treaties to their full extent, to shoulder our responsibilities and to be capable, between us, of reaching compromises. If we prove incapable of reaching compromises between us, then, at that point, we will no longer have the legitimacy to criticise others who are incapable of reaching them. However, we have three months to get there. We have a responsibility to do so; the people of Europe are watching us.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, now is not the time for hysteria, exaggeration or melodrama on any side, here or anywhere else. We should analyse the events of last week coolly and calmly. The United Kingdom was not in the euro on Thursday, it was not in the euro on Saturday. Nothing changed. The United Kingdom wants to see a solution to the eurozone crisis, but not a solution at the expense of the single market, and competitiveness continues to be the key.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK is still a full member of the European Union and will remain so. We believe in our national interests that we should be part of the EU. The UK’s position on the euro is unique; we also have a major trading currency to protect. It makes sense for existing eurozone countries to strengthen the rules governing the euro in the future and it would seem logical for countries who aspire to join the euro to sign up to those rules also. It not only makes little sense but it seems unfair to make demands on the UK unless safeguards could be secured in major areas such as protecting the City, but also protecting Europe from the City too.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to have a strategy to deal with the Greek and the wider sovereign debt problem. Underlining banking weakness, reducing budgetary debt, adjusting loan arrangements and improving capitalisation of our banks should, of course, still be the real priority of all our leaders today.</p>

Can I ask him to help me translate some of the phrases that appear in last week’s agreement, for example, the ‘automatic sanctions’ proposed. Is it not the case that this actually refers to fines of hundreds of millions of euro for countries that dare to stray from the austerity policies imposed by the unelected Commission?</p>
      <p sl="en">One refers innocuously to the ‘strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of Member States’. Is that not the same sort of surveillance as that exercised by colonial powers over their colonies? Is not the ‘fiscal stability union’ which this agreement proposes an austerity union in reality, where the cutback policies proposed will be institutionalised and will impoverish further millions and destroy further economies?</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, you have effectively suspended democracy in Greece and Italy, imposing government by the bankers for the bankers. Can I ask you to respect the democratic right of the people of Ireland to a referendum and not to wage a campaign of fear and blackmail against them. Surely people – not only in Ireland, but right across Europe – should have a right to decide freely about such a fundamental change which diminishes democracy and enshrines austerity?</p>

That should be a cause for concern, particularly to those who have always shown themselves to be enthusiastic about Europe. The summit was, in fact, a pointless farce that has not calmed speculation, let alone stopped it.</p>
      <p sl="it">One fact certainly makes us realise that investors are afraid of a euro default soon. The European Banking Authority revealed it when it announced that some 40 banks in the European Economic Area have sold EUR 170 billion of credit default swaps (CDS) on Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds.</p>
      <p sl="it">The soaring CDS market is a sure sign that the markets are afraid of a default, that there is a lack of confidence, that speculation is rising and that investors are waving goodbye to Europe, thus giving speculation free rein. The euro as a currency is heading for disaster, since the markets are tending to reject it. This is the result you have achieved. Congratulations!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the umpteenth last-chance European summit will most probably have the same outcome as that of previous summits.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By rushing headlong into technocratic federalism, while showing no regard whatsoever for the basic rules of democracy, this summit has set in stone the policy of austerity and the submission of national budgets to the dictates of the Commission and the Court of Justice, with automatic financial penalties for the States to boot. The markets dreamt about this, and the governments have done it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The upshot will be a fall in consumption and an explosion in public debt. In other words, the sovereign debt problem is not behind us, but in front of us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One issue remains, however, and it proves who the real beneficiaries of this umpteenth pointless summit are. Once again, priority is being given to the banking and financial sector, to the detriment of the States and taxpayers.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the Presidents of the Commission and the Council explained to us how things went at the European Council, but then Mr Schulz took the floor and explained to us how things really went at the European Council.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my small way, I will confine myself to remarking that there was a clash of three positions – the British position, the position of the so-called Franco-German ‘Directoire’, and the position of the EU institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think it was good for everyone, and especially for each of our countries, that the Union institutions prevailed this time, because they made sure that the agreement was not limited to the 17 euro area countries, but was as inclusive as possible. The underlying problem remains, however, and therefore I ask you all to shoulder your responsibility and take every opportunity to tell the Franco-German ‘Directoire’ that enough is enough.</p>
      <p sl="it">I say that not because I have anything to demand for my country, Italy, but because I think it is important that we all demand that Europe be given its proper role. I admire the leaders of France and Germany, but I realise that success for the European project on the path it has to tread will depend on the 27 countries and on the assurances that the EU institutions can give them.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would therefore ask you to remember at all times, wherever you may be, that the right method is not to impose but to propose, and that that method should always be upheld by ensuring that everyone accepts individual responsibility, although the ultimate responsibility must lie with everyone together.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what does the result of the summit bring us? With regard to the automatic sanctions, I would simply like you to explain, gentlemen, what happens when a country has more than 3% debt in future and you want to apply automatic sanctions, but the country says that Article 126 and the current Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union apply. What will happen then? Then our finest hour, which Mr Lambsdorff has spoken about, will turn out not to have been so fine after all. It is a fake which is not worth the paper it is written on, because it does not change the real situation.</p>
      <p sl="de">In legal terms, what have you actually done? As far as the economy goes, research institutes are saying that in the next two years, perhaps four of the 17 euro area countries will be in a position to achieve the structural deficit target that you have imposed. Possibly by 2015, but only if we can avoid a recession. However, if we take your route, without a growth initiative, we will find ourselves in the midst of a recession. It is a mistake to believe that we can achieve these targets without additional programmes for growth. How will we do it? What have you decided? Without the European Parliament, you will not be able to get out of the mess that you have got yourselves into.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I believe that this agreement raises several issues. The first is as follows: this agreement has been presented as historic, decisive and the solution to the crisis. I am not at all convinced about that. I believe that it is just one more step, and not necessarily the best one, and that it will obviously not resolve the crisis. I fear that this is a negative response and, indeed, that adding a climate of legal uncertainty to the current climate of economic, social and financial uncertainty is not very sensible. That is my first point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the content, we were told that budgetary discipline was going to be included in the constitutions. I believe that this agreement is unsound. We need a Europe that has budgetary discipline, on the one hand, and budgetary solidarity, on the other. As you said, Mr Barroso, we cannot have one without the other. All it would take is for plans to be made for Europe, via the ECB, to guarantee loans at favourable rates to indebted countries, provided that those countries undertake the necessary internal structural reforms, not because Europe is asking them to do so, but because they want to do so for themselves. In other words, the two must go hand in hand.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The last point, to finish: we are told that an intergovernmental Europe is going to be built. I think that this is a mistake.

The United Kingdom has now turned its back on Europe, and that is a serious step that the UK has taken. Moreover, we have agreed sanctions for countries that are failing to repay their debts. They will, obviously, not be able to do that for a while yet, because it is a bit difficult to repay your debts in a recession. What I would like to warn you of is the fact that the European Union is about to become a union of unemployment.

We must achieve stability quickly, because it is this constant turmoil that is damaging our economic growth and thereby the interests of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, we are also making great progress, because the ‘six-pack’ comes into force today and I, as rapporteur, am pleased about that. I am proud of the role we, as the European Parliament, have played. A strong role for the European Commission, a democratic role for the European Parliament and a high level of responsibility for Member States and national parliaments. I was also pleased with the interim report by President Van Rompuy because it builds on the ‘six-pack’. I wonder, though, if that is the direction you chose during the summit? Your report is clear when it comes to budgetary discipline, but it is vague when it comes to the further economic cooperation that is so necessary.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The letter from Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, which came out at the same time as your report, calls for enhanced institutional cooperation with a leading role for government leaders and what it describes as the new preparatory structures. Government leaders who will appraise each other. That did not work in 2003 or in 2005 when it came to budgetary discipline, nor has it worked with the one-and-a-half-year Competition Pact; indeed, it has hardly produced any results.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am therefore curious, President Van Rompuy, and while your optimism, President Barroso, is worthy of praise, which way we go will be decisive, for we not only need more monetary integration but also more economic integration, in order to save our common currency. That will only work if, not just we, but also our government leaders and our community institutions, are given a weighty role. Therefore, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, Commissioner Rehn, we expect you to play a leading role. You can count on our support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Some of the British Conservative Party talk about David Cameron’s bulldog spirit – standing up to Merkel and Sarkozy, using Britain’s veto – but the only thing David Cameron has vetoed is Britain’s influence at the top table. He has left our country isolated in Europe, without allies and without influence. As Mr Barroso said, not 17 plus, but 27 minus.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cameron claims he was protecting the City of London, but in fact, he has failed to secure a single safeguard for UK financial services. He was trying to protect his friends in the City instead of protecting British jobs and growth, and he spectacularly failed in both.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UK Government believes its actions have prevented the 26 from using the resources of the EU 27. This point needs clarifying.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Presidents of the Council, the Commission and the Euro Group did as well as possible, given the limited input material. I abhor the veto deployed by Cameron. His demands were not moderate; they were a mix of an attempt to reverse agreed positions disguised as inaccurate invocations of Ecofin conclusions and interference in current legislative dossiers. It was a power grab reneging on agreed legislation. Crafted as a wolf in sheep’s clothing, it maybe fooled some Lib Dems in London, but it did not fool us or me. Asked to save the euro, Cameron gave in to his eurosceptic party. He has jeopardised UK interests, including those of the legitimate City, when there is nothing remaining in the agreement threatening the UK.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the first lesson you learn if you are doing a lifesaving course is that a drowning person will try to drag his rescuer underneath. I felt rather like that this morning, on the receiving end of this minute’s hate because of the United Kingdom having kept the pound, being threatened with the terrors of the Earth. Of course it was very reminiscent of what we were told when we stayed out of the euro in the first place. How is that working out for you by the way, gentlemen?</p>
      <p sl="en">There was overwhelming public support for the Prime Minister standing aside from this new fiscal union. As Mr Lambsdorff says, there are now effectively going to be two parallel treaty structures. There will be the EU and there will be the fiscal union, the FU – initials which, by the way, neatly summarise the attitude which eurozone leaders take to their own peoples. You are Irish and you are fed up with paying all this money to European bankers and bondholders: FU. You are Greek and you are thinking that devaluation might be preferable to this constant crisis: FU. You are a businessman and you do not want to fold to keep the euro together: FU.</p>

      <p sl="nl">There is definitely a system error in the euro area, and that system error lies in the fact that the socio-economic fabric of the Member States is too varied to enable the euro area to function in a sustainable and healthy way. This may be a depressing reality, but it is reality, nonetheless. We should therefore urgently do away with the taboo against advocating a smaller but stronger euro area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If we, as a Parliament, still want to be taken seriously, we would do well to adopt realistic positions and abandon the systematic flight forward. The systematic steps towards Eurobonds and a central bank, a European Central bank that will do nothing but fan inflation. Collectivisation of debt, which is what the majority of this House wants, will entrench the problems in the longer term rather than resolve them. This will lead to a Belgian situation, a situation of total ungovernability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I should like to begin by saying a few words about currencies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The 19th century was dominated by the pound sterling, the 20th century by the dollar; in the 21st century, we have no idea how currencies will be organised. This was one of the issues tabled by the President of the G20. We have a duty to manage our currency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Traditionally, we had one currency per State. We are experimenting with a currency for a region, a supranational currency. The creation of this economic area of 26 States is good news, Presidents and Heads of State or Government. Hungary has changed its mind, and Denmark is uniting with the euro area even though it was not obliged to do so. This is good news!</p>
      <p sl="fr">The United Kingdom is a major European country. We know why it has not joined the euro area: because of its financial services industry, as you said, Mr President. It is also because, in reality, it does not want the financial transaction tax, on which a political consensus is in the process of being reached.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second piece of good news concerns financial stability. All of our great democracies, with the exception of Greece, which is a special case – the conclusions say as much – have changed their government, have taken serious measures in relation to financial governance. We are putting plans in place to ensure the financial stability of our continent. This is good news. I do not believe in such a thing as contagion. We have to consolidate the golden rules and reform our Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are two issues that have not been resolved. The first is growth. Mr President, I believe the time has come to hold a special European Council in order to examine growth conditions and the terms of a major European investment plan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second issue concerns the huge disappointment of democrats. Contrary to what was written in Ms Merkel and President Sarkozy’s letter, there has been no mention whatsoever of a parliamentary dimension. The Heads of State or Governments’ failure to add a parliamentary dimension to economic governance is plain wrong! I suggest you do something about it.</p>

You do not change the fire department regulations. At least, that is what common sense tells us and I fear that the decisions adopted on 9 December were lacking in any such common sense.

I think that the issue to be dealt with concerns the broad guidelines on growth set by the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States. That is why I would reiterate my proposal: a future European Council should set broad guidelines on growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In truth, we know what the two broad guidelines are. The first, as the Commission President mentioned, is a major plan for investing in infrastructure via project bonds. The second is an internal market that can be more than 27 national markets, with flexicurity, and in which we will find the one or two growth points that we need, both to pay off our debts and to finance social progress with the economic prosperity we will create.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the cheers that accompanied this agreement have already stopped. Is anyone surprised? The package offers no immediate solution to the crisis: no pooling of debt via Eurobonds – even though they have Mr Van Rompuy’s backing – and no strengthening of the European Financial Stability Facility or provision of a banking licence to enable it to raise funds via the ECB, which will not intervene in sovereign debt matters. What happened to using the tax on financial transactions as a fair taxation tool and an own resource? Perhaps there is no longer any urgency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After all, Mr Sarkozy, having pushed through two austerity plans in order to maintain France’s AAA rating, declared yesterday that a rating downgrade was not such a big obstacle to overcome. Who are they trying to kid? In the longer term, this agreement will be one of sanctions and fear, and it will put a little more pressure on the Member States, which are already struggling. The austerity policies decreed by ‘Merkozy’ are set to plunge Europe back into recession, and Europeans into unemployment. Where is the solidarity? Where are the jobs and growth?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe is not a poor Union, but it needs to revitalise its industry, develop its infrastructure and offer its young people prospects for the future. This requires investment, which the Member States and the Union should be helped to finance. This is what justifies revising this Treaty. Any other decision would mean bypassing the national parliaments and the European Parliament and would thus be undemocratic.</p>

It is, however, just a small step, because there may be no ‘solidarity’ in a Europe where two big countries are trying to dictate all the decisions, and when richer farmers still receive four times more in subsidies than poorer ones. What is even more important is that a ‘Europe of solidarity’ should have a dimension beyond the materialistic. This means that we must return to our Christian roots and values.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the substance of the agreement reached, a binding commitment to macrofinancial debt brakes and fiscal rigours, and strengthening the firewall and firepower of the ESM. The question is, are those instruments sufficient? This remains an open question. I welcome the wide, inclusive front of – hopefully – 26 Member States. It is not 17 plus, it is 27 minus. We should preserve the unity of the Union and avoid a two-speed Europe at all costs. The dividing line, unfortunately, is between those willing and those unwilling, not between eurozone and non-eurozone. We are all in the same boat. It is a crisis of excessive debt, not a crisis of the euro currency.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am extremely concerned by the method chosen, i.e. an intergovernmental agreement. The third best option was chosen and the lowest common denominator applied. It has one key deficiency: it is outside the single institutional framework of the EU Treaty and its institutions. It has three deficiencies. It is weaker in terms of enforcement – no EC, no ECJ; it is weaker in terms of democratic scrutiny legitimacy – no European Parliament; and it weakens the Community method as such.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to try to remedy the shortcomings of this imperfect compromise. The European Parliament should be invited to be associated with the agreement, because in future it will be part of the acquis . We should provide for the repatriation and transposition of this fiscal union agreement into the EU legal order and Treaties and institutions. The rights of the European Parliament in this new agreement should be guaranteed and safeguarded.</p>

What counts more, because we have allowed it to count, is the assessment made by the markets and that assessment, as movements on the stock exchanges and bond markets yesterday and today have illustrated, was negative and paradoxically – not to put all the blame on the markets and deny our political responsibilities – it was negative because, as yesterday’s report by one of the three credit rating agencies tellingly put it, the decisions adopted by the European Council do not respond to or deal with the immediate risk of economic slowdown and the problems in the banking system.</p>
      <p sl="el">Therefore, we are debating and planning the future of the euro area, but are still unable to manage the present and that is due in large measure to the fact that every Community decision-making procedure has been circumvented.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would firstly like to say that the intergovernmental treaty was the only possible solution in an emergency situation. However, this treaty means a redistribution of sovereignty, a new social compact, and requires greater involvement on the part of the Commission and Parliament in order to give it legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="es">What was the aim of these agreements? Two things, as President Van Rompuy has said. Firstly, to convince the markets that we want to continue together, that this is not a pegged exchange rate system that can be reversed at any time, and secondly, to stabilise the markets.</p>
      <p sl="es">I agree that, over the medium term, fiscal union was absolutely essential, because this crisis has been caused in part by government excess. However, it is not just the excesses of governments that have caused the crisis. Ireland and Spain had sound public finances and yet they are also in difficulties, because they were not competitive enough, because there was too much private indebtedness. This is why I place enormous importance on correcting macro-economic imbalances, which has gone somewhat unnoticed, and enormous importance on the issue of growth, which has gone unnoticed too.</p>
      <p sl="es">The uncertainty is greater with regard to stabilising the markets. I agree that we have corrected the private participation mistake: it was an error and we have put it right now. We have made a little progress on rescue mechanisms, but I am not sure that the provision made will be sufficient and that we will have the financing resources to make them effective. There are questions about leveraging the temporary mechanism and doubts about the permanent mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mr Barroso, I ask you to continue with the basket of bonds that, in my opinion, would be a good way of financing this fund. It would overcome the fragmentation in the debt market and make sovereign debt a risk-free asset once again.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Central Bank will only act if it believes the summit will bring security, and we will see in the coming days whether it does or not. However, if it does not, it will have to seek alternative options, because we cannot go into battle against the crisis with one arm tied behind our backs.</p>
      <p sl="es">If the Member States have to insure against possible losses, then let them do so, but let us find a way of stabilising the markets that, may I say, are not doing well at all right now.</p>

It was exactly what was expected. Some people are certainly not happy. However, what matters now, in order to regain credibility with respect to the markets, is for the results of this European Council to be implemented as quickly as possible, without hesitation. This is also, I would stress, so that we can begin to see tangible results in implementing the adjustment programmes of the two countries, Greece and Italy. Achieving progress in implementing these programmes will greatly enhance the European Union’s credibility in the eyes of the financial markets.</p>

In order to save the euro, the Council is proposing a Treaty that is intergovernmental in nature, is a legal absurdity and is an attack on democracy. In order to calm the markets, it is proposing more austerity and penalties, which has the opposite effect. Without a strategy for economic growth, it is impossible to calm the markets. Are Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy unable to grasp the obvious? Austerity measures will lead to economic recession, to reduced consumption and exports, and to increased bankruptcies and unemployment.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, first of all, I should like to say that I have always viewed this juncture in the Union as one at which we would probably need an intergovernmental approach. That is not because I do not believe in the Community method, but because the Treaty of Lisbon was not, in my view, a sufficient basis for the reforms that needed to be made, so there was a chance that we would need to go through this, just as the European Union has on many occasions. I do not believe that this is anything out of the ordinary. I do believe, however, that there is a need, now, starting from the point at which we have reached an agreement on the so-called budgetary union or fiscal union, to transfer part of the powers resulting from it to the EU institutions; to the Commission, in particular, and to Parliament, which must find its own role here, in conjunction, indeed, with the Council and the Commission. I believe this is crucial if we are to have a constructive approach.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are then other aspects not directly related to the activity of the various actors, particularly those linked to the European Central Bank (ECB) and its ability to intervene. The ECB is independent, but it should currently be using its independence to strengthen and add credibility to the steps that have just been taken, some of them perhaps reluctantly. In some ways, this is induced by the very conclusions of the Council, because the ECB is now associated with the European Stability Mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility. That sends a very important message that there is a strategy that is, shall we say, concerted, or at least that they in fact seem to be working together and to have some capacity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is, therefore, now also a case of working on the legal issues, so that we here in Parliament can use our political strength to democratise the conclusions of this Council in some way too. I am not optimistic, but I am confident despite everything, and I believe steps have been taken that could be the start of the solution.</p>

This is by no means insignificant. On the contrary, it sends out a very important message.

I say ‘may’ advisedly. However, what is happening about the measures for recovery that you yourself have mentioned? What about the proposals to create new jobs? What is happening with regard to the role of the European Central Bank (ECB)? What about Eurobonds? We have heard nothing about any of these things at this summit. Most importantly, what are we doing to respond to the economic war being waged by some rating agencies against the European Union? As far as I can see, this has not been discussed either. However, we do need to talk about it. The big disappointment for me, and I would like to be quite open about this, is that I do not see why those organisations which have always profited from this situation, such as the big banks and the private banks, should now be totally absolved from any participation and why the taxpayers will once again have to pay. This was the wrong decision.</p>

Many years ago, in 1985, this Chamber debated a report by Professor Cecchini ordered by the Commission entitled ‘The cost of non-Europe’. We were all convinced at the time that, if we were to have real European Union, we needed a common currency. However, monetary union had design faults. The European Council now appears to be discussing what the cost of Europe, rather than the cost of non-Europe, would be.</p>
      <p sl="el">How can we debate a change to the Treaty in the sense of a transnational, Schengen-type agreement in this day and age? I am sure that you will tell me a great deal of time is needed for a European convention, for everything that needs to be done, and for the national parliaments to participate. Regardless of whether or not time is needed, democratic legitimisation is needed and democratic legitimisation of decisions taken in a fragmentary manner – because I do not think that we are done with the Council of 8 and 9 December – is impossible unless the European Parliament at least has a role which, institutionally, more than covers the role of the national parliaments, which ultimately is non-existent.</p>

That is why I also raised the question of the democratic legitimisation of those decisions and I said that, if the national parliaments are not involved – because they are not involved – the European Parliament should at least have a more fundamental role and, of course, the European Commission is still the Guardian of the Treaties.</p>

The comparison with Schengen and Prüm is not valid, because those areas were not governed by the Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact is that we have reached this point because the premise was wrong; in other words, the Treaties could and should have been overhauled. We now have to find a way out, avoid the risk of renationalising Union competences, preserve the EU’s legal system, avoid duplications and, of course, correct an economic policy that is both wrong and inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="it">This House will watch carefully, ready to play its part in sorting out this incredible mess, by putting the process started at the European Council back on the rails of EU law, which are the only possible foundations on which a true fiscal union can be built.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I would first like to address the President of the European Council in order to congratulate him. To congratulate him, both on the proposals he prepared for the summit and on the results he has achieved, despite the fact that some Heads of State or Government have short-circuited.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As far as immediate action is concerned, we have definitely made progress and I believe that we now have the prospect of a firm firewall and sufficient solidarity. As far as the necessary budgetary discipline and integration are concerned, we have now really reached the necessary depth, both in terms of rules and in terms of monitoring and enforcement, and, in this respect, we may say that 2011 has really brought a genuine Copernican revolution.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Having said that, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I am extremely worried about the new budget treaty. Worried about both the method and the form it will take. In what way will that treaty come about? Which institutions will contribute staff to it? What about democracy, the Community method? Which master tinkerer will still be able to marry harmoniously decisions taken within the Treaty of Lisbon, on the one hand, and those outside it, on the other?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have one final question, which I address to the President of the Commission: should we now stop focusing on the economic pillar, on the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy and on the concern for economic growth, competitiveness and job creation? Because we have criteria in our Stability and Growth Pact which, nonetheless, have not just a nominator, but a denominator, too.</p>

      <p sl="en">I listened carefully to Mr Van Rompuy. Perhaps his quiet way does not appeal to the media, but he speaks with great sense and great calmness. He said that we are on a long road to recovery. We need to change the narrative. There will be no instant or one-meeting solution to this crisis. Let us not ignore the progress that was made on Thursday and Friday, even though we are disappointed with aspects of it. Let us salute that little bit of progress and look for more towards March.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say that there is one issue that I am really concerned about. It is the sense in which the Franco-German axis is the European Union. I fear that this is bad for France and for Germany. We need to rebuild the solidarity of 27 Member States of equal status within the European Union. I think that will help us restore Europe and save the euro.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, nothing has been enough. Over the past three years, we have witnessed a succession of Councils, each of which has been at the mercy of the grade that the financial markets would decide to give its decisions on the following Monday. It turns out that the markets are still giving the European Council’s decisions a failing grade, because not one of the results so far appears to have pleased them. Nothing has been enough, and our efforts are still failing.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reason for this is simple. It is because we are still focusing on a strategy that is partial, insufficient and biased. It is partial because, although it does impact on austerity, it ignores growth and the need for investment to generate employment, the role that the European Central Bank must take and the subsequent issuance of Eurobonds. It is insufficient because what is called fiscal union is, in fact, only a budgetary union, budgetary coordination, and ignores the aspect of inflows and the correction of the tax and fiscal inequalities in the European Union. Above all, it is biased, because it is an intergovernmental agreement that sits badly with the provisions for treaty amendment enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon itself, which made the European Parliament, which represents 500 million citizens, the most powerful parliament in the history of the European Union, and with good reason, because it represents 500 million people.</p>

The European Union needs to deepen cooperation. The United Kingdom need not fear this. If it does so, it is because a flawed voting system, a party with a shrunken mind and the mass media power of an Australian-American have brought the moment to its crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">To restore monetary stability and to return to prosperity, we need more discipline in Member States and more unity at Union level. We must anchor the new treaty in the structures and methods of the EU. And there is a message for Europe’s right-wing parties who largely preside over this mess.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy – I see that he is no longer here – with Greece, we had a clear case of budgetary misconduct. However, if I look at Portugal, Spain or Ireland, I do not see a lack of budgetary discipline as being the cause of the problem. If I look at Italy, it has a very high level of debt, but its budget deficit is lower than Germany’s was when it destroyed the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I am trying to say is that the problems we are facing are far from being confined to budgetary discipline. Yet what are we hearing from the Council and the Commission? That the problem is one of budgetary discipline and that the only solutions are budgetary discipline solutions – by applying them, we will solve the problem outright.</p>

However, there will be a lot of collateral damage. The Netherlands will lose the right to veto payments from the new European Stability Mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A motion by my party members on this matter in the Hague was supported by only a few groups, which is utterly incomprehensible. We have pitched battles being fought over every euro that needs to be saved in the Netherlands, but people apparently have no problem with billions being squandered on an amputated budget in Europe. The Netherlands will also lose an important ally, now that the United Kingdom is pulling out.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Give it a little while and the Dutch Prime Minister Rutte will be nothing more than an attendant in the power marriage between Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy. Mr Sarkozy’s position has, unfortunately, been strengthened, because he has got rid of the Brits and their Atlantic allegiance. There is reason to fear that the necessary restructuring and budget cuts will fail to manifest and that the ECB will sort out even more junk bonds.

      <p sl="de">As far as the debt brake is concerned, structural deficits of only 0.5% of GDP are now permitted. In the area of automatic sanctions, the European Commission is now allowed to intervene immediately where countries have deficits that are too high and to provide monitoring and guidance. In addition, it is now supervising budget planning in the Member States much more closely than was the case before. It is regrettable that only 26 Member States have signed up for this pact and this also represents a potential risk for the future of Europe. However, we have quite obviously learnt from the failure to comply with the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty. We have also learnt from our most recent mistakes.</p>

      <p sl="it">President Barroso was therefore right to emphasise these ideas and launch the stability bonds, because we cannot afford not to invest as well – or primarily – in growth and development, as these are vital ingredients for a concrete response to the economic crisis and unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, a joint project with no leaders is a good thing. My only regret is about the United Kingdom, which has confirmed Charles De Gaulle’s remark that the UK only wanted to join the European Union to slow down or boycott the joint European project.

      <p sl="sk">As the representative of one of the smaller Member States, I particularly resent the way in which France and Germany met before the actual summit, and de facto announced the decisions they had taken to the other Member States so that we could rubber-stamp them. I also find it unfortunate that the measures that were adopted are more restrictive; they impose restrictions on national budgets, but what I do not see is the growth-related or socially-oriented aspects of these measures. However, I would be very pleased if those decisions that were taken could become effective in the short term, if the fundamental changes facing us in the European Union were decided by a convention, and if far greater opportunities were provided for involving other European institutions in implementing cooperation.

      <p sl="fr">This should not, however, disguise the fact that many UK citizens disagree with their prime minister. I refer in particular to our Liberal and Labour colleagues. However, I have to say that the general tone of this morning’s debate has not helped to bring us closer to the UK’s pro-European political movements. That is not very wise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is not my only concern, however. The way in which the governments of two Member States of the European Union are trying to impose their will on the others is perhaps not the best way of strengthening cohesion within the EU in the long term and thus of respecting the authority of the President of the European Council.

When we get into debt, we are damaging growth, employment and our future prospects. What are we calling for? No parallel structures, but a more in-depth approach, a decision not to play off the confidence of the citizens against the confidence of the markets and a convention which will change the Treaty of Lisbon and the bilateral Treaties with the involvement of the European Union.

As if the treaty on the monetary union would substantially restrict our national sovereignty. This is a dangerous development because it might spread to other countries as well. There is no doubt that this agreement restricts the leeway of national politicians, but in doing so, it also limits the possibility of irresponsible and erroneous decisions. Is there anything that is more in the interest of citizens? Beyond the over-long control of the democratic elections held every four years, this monetary union demands budgetary and economic policy discipline from all present and future governments.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, many important issues were raised during this debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, on the issue of substance and form, I agree that in a Community that is based on the rule of law, form is important. That is why we in the Commission did everything we could to get an agreement that could be considered compatible with the Community method, an agreement that could be signed by all the Member States. I have to say that this was not only the position of the Commission, but of the President of the European Council. He presented that as the clear preference. It was also the opinion of most of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, I presented to you in a very open way – because I think this is my duty in terms of democratic accountability to this Parliament – why I think this was not possible. The alternative now is either to avoid stronger commitments of the European Union, namely, of those Member States that are ready to go further, or try to formulate this agreement in a way that is fully compatible with European Union law.</p>
      <p sl="en">This issue raises important legal and institutional matters. I have been frank in making some of these points to you. I think it is possible to do it, but it requires efforts on all sides. This is what the Commission is determined to do while always trying to be constructive. I think it is possible to come to an agreement that is fully compatible with European law and that addresses some of the concerns in terms of discipline and convergence in the euro area and indeed beyond the euro area. I can say to you what I also said in the European Council and in the formal summit; namely, that I think this Parliament should be associated with the present efforts for finding that solution. I am ready to work with you to that end.</p>
      <p sl="en">An issue that came up very often in the debate today was the position of the United Kingdom. It is important to put the UK relationship with the rest of the European Union in its proper context. Emotions are what they are but I think, as some of you have mentioned, that it is important to see how we can get out of a situation that was indeed unfortunate. I welcome the statement made yesterday by Prime Minister Cameron that he intends to continue to pursue a positive policy of engagement in the European Union on a whole range of issues, including growth and economic reform, smart regulation, fighting climate change and the development agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I sincerely believe that we have a joint interest to agree, and to agree among all of us. I think that it is in all of our interests to have a United Kingdom Government that fully engages with the other Member States and the European institutions. Indeed, it is the European institutions that are the best guarantee that the interests of all Member States, including the UK, will be fully respected. It is precisely through European institutions and in full respect of the Community method that we can avoid any kind of split, any kind of directorium, or any kind of derivation that will be negative for the overall interests of the Union and each one of its Member States. I therefore hope that we can work constructively with the UK Government to make sure that the fiscal compact now agreed dovetails neatly with the European Union Treaties so that the interests of all Member States and European institutions, including this Parliament, are respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the evaluation of the results, I was extremely prudent on purpose. I tried to avoid adjectives as much as I could. The reality is that by now, we have all learned that the solution to this crisis – as I have mentioned very often – is not a sprint, it is a marathon. When I use the expression ‘marathon’, I am not just thinking about the Greek situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">One can lose confidence in one day, but to recover confidence takes much longer. So what we need now in the euro area, and in the European Union, is a commitment to sustainability, to persistence, to rigour, to discipline and to convergence over time. There will be no panacea. There is no silver bullet. In these matters, there are no miracles. I think it is also important that we show everybody, including our partners, that we are committed to a solution and that we will work consistently, coherently and over time to reach that solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">As some of you said – and, in fact, I also made the point in my introductory remarks – the issue of budget discipline and addressing the problems of debt is an important one, but it is not the whole problem. We have in Europe, and in the euro area, a problem of sovereign debt. This sovereign debt is partly the cause of the crisis, but it is partly also the result of the crisis. The crisis started with the subprime problems when, in fact, there was a problem in terms of the evaluation of risk by markets and investors.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have both a sovereign debt crisis and a financial crisis at the same time, but at the origin of these different crises, we have a problem in Europe of competitiveness. We are losing our position to many of our competitors in the world. That is why we need the reforms to enhance our competitiveness and to liberate the potential for growth. That is why, in fact, what we have discussed in this summit is only part of the solution because it addresses only part of the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need fiscal discipline. We need, of course, to be rigorous in terms of having a debt sustainability path, but we also need measures for growth. I made this point very clearly. We need growth in Europe. That is why I think we now have an agenda. We have the EU 2020 agenda and we have other initiatives to address this major problem of growth. Without creating confidence globally that Europe is able to restore growth, I believe we cannot get out of this current crisis. This is our position. This is the position that the Commission has sustained over time and we are ready to work with you and, of course, with all the institutions in that direction, as I said earlier, to build a Europe of stability but also a Europe of growth, a Europe of responsibility but also a Europe of solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is our commitment and we will go on working for this, hopefully with all the Member States and in full respect of the principles that made our Union what it is today, after all a Union of free, democratic societies committed to the very strong values of the rule of law, justice, freedom and solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, firstly, with regard to the overall assessment of the results of this European Council, I believe that we need to be consistent in our analysis. We cannot say, on the one hand, that the financial markets are jointly responsible for the current crisis and the difficulties we have to overcome and, on the other, that we are waiting for them to react before we assess the political decisions that were taken during European summits.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, as the Commission President just said, unfortunately, there is no magic solution – there really is not. The confidence that has been lost can only be restored bit by bit. The crisis of confidence has been too severe for it to change overnight. We still do not have all the facts, and I am not going to say any more on the matter. However, the fact that some Member States have failed to implement the plans that were requested of them creates mistrust. The fact that some Member States have waited far too long to act – we saw this again in the summer – creates a crisis of confidence that cannot be resolved at EU level. Therefore, the Member States have a huge responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are also crises of confidence that are completely unnecessary. On 21 July, we decided to make our rescue instrument, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), more flexible and more effective. The markets thought that we would never be able to get the parliaments of the 17 Member States of the euro area to approve the measures taken and decided on. We succeeded, however.</p>
      <a text="(The President called for silence in the Chamber)"/>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, in the summer – on 21 July – we took some decisions with the aim of making our temporary rescue fund system more effective. We succeeded in gaining the 17 national parliaments’ support for all that in less than three months; in around two and a half months, in fact. The markets had very serious doubts about whether we would succeed. We did succeed, but in the meantime, mistrust was created and it has never gone away. Consequently, there is no magic solution. There are many aspects that we are not in control of, which explains our current situation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third topic of discussion: many of you have emphasised the combination of responsibility and solidarity, and rightly so, because that is the very perspective from which the first European Council that I chaired was held. It is important, in this case, for Greece to shoulder its responsibilities and for us to be ready to show solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Honourable Members, we have been extremely supportive of each other and we want to be even more so. We have decided to grant EUR 110 billion in bilateral loans to Greece alone. We have created a temporary bailout fund with a EUR 500 billion guarantee. We have taken the decision and we will lay down the definitive rules on the permanent fund, which will be worth at least EUR 500 billion. We have even said that, this time, we will assess in March whether the EUR 500 billion ceiling is sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Point four: we have just decided to raise approximately EUR 200 billion in bilateral loans, to be channelled through the International Monetary Fund. If you add together all these hundreds of billions of euro, then yes, we are unified. Some might say that we are even too unified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Central Bank is not a solidarity tool. The Central Bank is a stability tool: it stabilises inflation and the euro area. Moreover, the Central Bank has recently taken some extremely important decisions, and it will do so again next week. The importance of its decisions will become clear later on. It has decided to make funds available to the banks, even over three-year terms. This is an unprecedented measure, but it has taken it to create stability.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some of you rightly talked about the intergovernmental treaty and asked questions on the issue. As the Commission President said earlier …</p>
      <a text="(The President again called for silence)"/>
      <p sl="fr">As the Commission President said earlier, an intergovernmental treaty was not our first choice. Our first choice was to revise the Treaty in different ways: Protocol 12, other protocols, the ordinary method for amending the Treaties, the simplified method for amending them, secondary legislation. We had a whole range of legal instruments for achieving our objective. We lacked unanimity. There is nothing I can do about that, and I am not going to stir up controversy on this issue in public. That would prevent us from returning to the negotiating table at a later date in order to agree on a proper Treaty change, one that includes the acquis of the intergovernmental treaty. One day, we will come together again as 27, so that everyone agrees on those issues on which a consensus could not be reached a few days ago.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everything we do will be in accordance with the Treaty. Of course, the intergovernmental treaty must respect the Treaty or Treaties of the Economic Union. We will respect the acquis of the single market. Of course we will! There will be no discrimination; no discrimination will be applied. The Commission will see to that, as indeed it should, by virtue of its role. If possible, the Court of Justice will be included. This is permitted under Article 273.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall respond to Mr Schulz with regard to the role of the European Parliament. I was very brief when I spoke on this issue – and on other issues besides. I said that we would, of course, involve the European Parliament in our work, in the process of drafting this intergovernmental treaty, as we have done in the past and as we will do again now, in keeping with previous intergovernmental conferences. More specifically, with regard to the working group that will be carrying out the preparatory work, several Members of the European Parliament will, of course, be involved in it, as will other members of the Euro Working Group and those who are contributing to the joint effort to obtain a sound intergovernmental treaty. I shall say it again: this is not our first choice, it is our second choice, but since this is how it is, we will do everything possible to ensure that it marks a step forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Economic policy is a matter of common interest. We made this point in the conclusions of our summit. There are ‘six-pack’ mechanisms – and some of you have mentioned them – that will be extremely important in economic coordination terms. Macro-economic surveillance is a major innovation in our political infrastructure. As regards the Euro Plus Pact, had we been able to work more quickly on Thursday and Friday, we would have had a statement by the Commission President on the state of play, on the implementation of the Euro Plus Pact. The documents are ready. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to hold a very detailed discussion on the issue, but all the information is there.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The major economic reforms are in addition to everything that was decided in the ‘six-pack’, in the Euro Plus Pact. We will discuss them at European summits, at the European Council, to ensure that some countries do not practise a policy of increasing revenue or raising the retirement age while the others lag behind. We need a uniform approach on different levels and we need those at the highest level to be aware of it, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can make a huge amount of progress on different levels. Once again, will this be the magic solution? No. However, I would say this: at some point over the next few years, when this crisis is behind us – because, unlike some of you, I am essentially an optimist – it will become clear what was achieved in 2010 and 2011. Much further down the line, people will say that it was during those decisive years, those difficult years, that the foundations were laid to prevent a repeat of this crisis. We have changed the Union substantially. Moreover, what is now an annus horribilis will one day be considered an annus mirabilis.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Last Friday, the European Council decided to enshrine the concept of fiscal discipline in a new treaty. This is a step in the right direction. The new treaty needs to ensure that the rules agreed at the time of the introduction of the euro are actually enforced. It is also important that the Emergency Fund is used effectively. The question is whether the EUR 500 billion from the temporary and permanent emergency funds, supplemented with EUR 200 billion through the IMF, will prove sufficient.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Banking Authority has calculated a capital requirement of EUR 114.7 billion, based on the exposure of European banks to government bonds. However, the total capital requirement is higher, because banks have outstanding loans in the private sector, not all of which are of a high quality. One real solution to the euro crisis which I advocate is as follows: the weak euro countries must gain economic competitiveness through reform and cuts.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, unsustainably high debt levels in the private sector, particularly those accrued by banks, should be reduced in a controlled fashion.</p>

      <p sl="hu">From a legal standpoint, the present summit did not create an easy situation. What we were expecting did not happen, stability was not created, meaning that the trust of the markets could not be regained. Of course it would be worth examining whether this should be our primary aim at all, or whether regaining the trust of the European citizens should take precedence. An agreement has been reached on several matters, pointing to a strengthening of the budgetary union, but an intergovernmental fiscal agreement such as this cannot serve as a satisfactory solution in crisis management. In terms of content, we do have an intergovernmental agreement that brings balance to the national budgets and ensures the application of a correction mechanism to reduce general government deficit, as well as the application of automatic sanctions in excessive deficit procedures, but as regards form, it is unclear how we can put all this into effect. The pact concluded at the summit can be fulfilled only if a Community method for its implementation is found as soon as possible. At the same time, we must not forget that besides measures taken in order to ensure stability, key steps towards economic growth would still be life-saving, yet were unfortunately not brought up at the summit. A shadow has once again been cast on the targets set for job creation and economic growth. Furthermore, we must not forget that this new agreement has also resulted in new national commitments, and therefore countries that make their support for the pact conditional on parliamentary authorisation, including Hungary, are in the right.</p>

      <p sl="en">The outcomes of the recent EU summit of 8-9 December 2011 are partly satisfying. On the one hand, I am pleased leaders took a firm decision to apply new fiscal rules to EU Member States for tackling the euro area crisis. On the other hand, I deplore the fact that this agreement failed to include all 27 EU Member States. In the new situation, reflected by the UK’s veto, many questions remain to be answered: for example, what is the role of Parliament in the new situation? What parts of the new EU Treaty will apply, and to whom? How will the UK’s veto affect future discussions on plans to introduce EU-wide taxes? These questions must be resolved in order to end confusion and restore trust in the euro currency. So long as we do not have concrete answers, speculators, who have played their share in provoking the euro crisis, continue making money by betting on the future of the euro area and the future of the EU. I remain hopeful that solutions can be found to these problems within the EU common framework, so as to avoid new divisions between EU Member States and to preserve integration and trust – two essential features for the future of our Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">The crisis buffeting the eurozone demands decisive action to restore stability and certainty. However, the outcome of the recent Council summit will lead us further down the path of austerity without a plan for future jobs and growth. Saving the euro will require much more than a crash diet that will fall apart in the long run. What is needed is a long-term vision that will withstand the test of time. Otherwise, we would merely be prolonging the patient’s illness instead of issuing the correct prescription. Just as with the single market, Member States must take the necessary ownership and responsibility to overcome the shortcomings exposed by the sovereign debt crisis. The role of the ECB will also have to evolve to address present economic realities. Therefore, we must make every effort in 2012 to strengthen the euro and the single market, the two pillars of European integration. Altering or reversing course would risk creating a two, or even three-speed Europe. My hope is that the new treaty will be negotiated on a fair playing field, with the input of the European Parliament and national parliaments, to ensure the treaty has proper democratic accountability.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The new Treaty that the German right intends to push through would deprive the Member States of a budgetary policy by forcing them to implement austerity policies that are set to plunge Europe into recession without reducing deficits. Economic policy choices would be enshrined in the constitutions and placed under the authority of a Court of Justice. Automatic penalties would be applied to countries whose public deficit exceeds 3% of their GDP. However, this Treaty fails to include any measures for resolving the economic and social crisis: there is nothing about Eurobonds or about the ECB intervening on the primary market to purchase government bonds. Therefore, how can anyone be surprised about the rise in euroscepticism? We urgently need to show that a progressive economic strategy is possible. We call for the creation of a European treasury, the embryo of which could be the European Financial Stability Facility, and for an independent rating agency, attached to the European Court of Auditors. The power to rate sovereign debts would be taken away from private agencies, in which there are obvious conflicts of interest. We also propose the creation of an investment pact to revive the economy through the exclusion of investment expenditure from the calculation of public deficits. With an EU budget swelled by Eurobonds and the financial transaction tax, we would fund the upwards convergence of competitiveness levels and social and fiscal rules.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Council summit held last week was once again called a meeting of last resort. Analysts and journalists were constantly trying to convince us that it was the final opportunity to make a decision on saving the common currency. When you look at the consensus reached from this perspective, you may feel disappointed. However, the compromise achieved, which may help the Member States to improve the soundness of their public finances and thus save the common currency, should be appreciated. Yet the fact that the proposed changes will not be included in the Treaties, but adopted instead by an intergovernmental agreement, is a significant deficiency. The question that arises is this: what will be the role of the Community’s institutions in the framework of the emerging fiscal union? We need to take all possible measures to maintain the strong position of Community institutions, because they are the only safeguards of the principle of solidarity and equality amongst states. We must not allow a situation to arise where we save the euro but we lose the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should not forget that only the acquis communautaire and EU institutions guarantee an equal position for all Member States. Despite the shortcomings of the agreement, we should welcome the fact that the intergovernmental agreement reached is not limited only to the euro area, but is open to other members of the EU.

      <p sl="ro">The European Council meeting held on 9 December 2011 failed to impose its viewpoint on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area, even though it noted once again that all the required legal conditions have been fulfilled. Due to the lack of political will, the message conveyed by the Council was not persuasive enough. The constant veto from the Netherlands raises doubts about the legitimacy of this state’s declarations which, on the one hand, state that Romania has done its duty and complied with all the requirements set out by the Schengen acquis , while, on the other, it does not comply with the political agreement signed with the other Member States.</p>

However, in addition to that, I would like to suggest paying more attention to the e-governance of the Member States as well as the EU. The mode in which citizens communicate with their respective countries or the supranational institutions is, in many countries, still very archaic. It is high time to step into the 21st century and adapt to modern technologies. E-governance is cheap, transparent, decreases bureaucracy and corruption and is convenient and user-friendly for the citizens. I am confident that it complements the austerity measures, while having also a positive impact on societies and governments. Estonia is a good example. After introducing e-governance, the corruption has decreased significantly – the rate is one of the lowest in the EU.

However, the dissent of one country attracted much more attention than the agreement reached by the other 26. I think the latter aspect needs to be emphasised more strongly. Important decisions were made and politicians finally took action after months of inactivity, as they realised there was a need for a number of measures that Parliament had been calling for for months. Now is the time to put them into practice. The focus is on fiscal and budgetary discipline and on control by the EU institutions. Quite rightly, we need to go back to having rules on budgetary discipline, and procedures must be automatic. I have noticed, however, that Parliament is hardly ever mentioned, and I hope this can be remedied in the work to be done over the coming weeks. We must not forget growth, though, because if we adopt strict rules on government budgets and also call for rigorous structural reforms, we must also implement measures for growth.

      <p sl="fi">The political outcome of the EU summit in December is almost zero in terms of its value and beating the current crisis. Crucial economic matters were simply not discussed. There was no talk of growth, employment or defeating the recession. The subject discussed was mainly just budgetary discipline. At the summit, it was decided that the direction to take should be towards closer cooperation in the form of budgetary discipline, though outside EU structures. This is a setback for European democracy, the guarantee of which lies in cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I am afraid that, in addition to the debt and economic crises, we now also have a democratic crisis, one achieved at the EU summit, with economic union being established outside EU structures, and with no democratic control.

Even if regrettable, it is not lethal. The future negotiations must include all willing eurozone and non-eurozone members. Including the EU institutions is also necessary. Legal coherence must be ensured between the intergovernmental treaty and European legislation; eventually, they should form one juridical instrument.

Having had a weekend to consider the fallout, ‘the markets’ have responded in a way which leaves little room for interpretation: credit rating agencies are preparing their credit downgrades and, yesterday, Italy was still paying nearly 6% interest – and this despite the arrival of Mario Monti and his technocratic cabinet – albeit under pressure from ‘the markets’ and Europe. This is, at the same time, one of the very disturbing and more fundamental trends of the euro crisis. After all, it has caused a huge rift in many arenas: in the economic, budgetary and political arenas, but also in the democratic arena.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, it is ironic that, at a time when more and more citizens are taking to the streets and various protest movements are springing up like mushrooms out of the ground, the European decision-making process is being scrupulously kept behind closed doors. Worse still, the European Parliament is being sidelined. Nevertheless, one of the lessons which can be learned from this debate is that we would actually be able to achieve a result in tackling the crisis if the European Parliament were allowed to join the table. After all, we do have a consensus here that we should take steps that will offer people future prospects and introduce Eurobonds across party lines and national borders. The only genuine solution is a democratic one.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to request that, before the single vote is held, you put to the vote in plenary an amendment that was unanimously adopted last night by the Committee on Budgets. The amendment was tabled at a late stage, and we were unable to translate it into all the languages due to a lack of time. We had no other option, however, and it is a very important amendment in political terms.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, following the agreement reached last week in trialogue on the financing of the ITER project, the Council – as we learnt yesterday afternoon – adopted this agreement unanimously, but with a unilateral declaration signed by six Member States, which gives the agreement a completely different interpretation from the one given to it by Parliament’s delegation. Therefore, the Committee on Budgets felt it necessary for Parliament to reiterate its interpretation formally this morning, because we would not have reached this agreement in trialogue without it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the light of these facts, I call for the application of Rule 161(3) of the Rules of Procedure, under which this amendment, though belated, may be put to the vote due to exceptional circumstances.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would remind you that the Court of Auditors of the European Union is composed of 27 Members. Under Article 286 of the Treaty, the Members shall be appointed by the Council after it has consulted Parliament. Today, we are holding a consultation, which will be referred to the Council. Therefore, the governments are the ones that propose candidates, and the European Parliament provides an opinion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is a total of eight candidates, proposed by eight States: Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Sweden. Four of those States – Belgium, Italy, Denmark and Spain – have recently seen a change of government. Two States – Denmark and Spain – with elections, and two – Belgium and Italy – without.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In one of those four States, the Kingdom of Spain, the political forces have changed – I was at the summit of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) in Marseille – whereas the other three States have made no demands. On the subject of Spain, the Spanish political forces have asked me to request that Parliament postpone the vote – as is possible under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure – in order to give them time to assess the situation. The King of Spain is due to appoint the government next week.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, following the earthquake that struck the Murcia region of Spain last May and the floods that hit the Veneto region in late October and early November 2010, the countries affected have applied to access the EU’s Solidarity Fund.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the case in question, in Veneto – a region in my country, Italy – the Commission recognised EUR 676 357 000 of direct damage as eligible, proposing assistance from the Solidarity Fund totalling EUR 17 million. Added to the EUR 21 million proposed for Spain, this makes a total budget transfer amounting to EUR 37.9 million.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I voted for this proposal for a directive with great conviction. I think the sequence of events that led up to today’s decision needs explaining.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission, Parliament and the Council have been working on this document ever since 2004. Over the following years, there were times when it was stop and go because of the resistance of several Member States, which were afraid of external interference and having their powers taken away in such a highly sensitive area as the law of criminal procedure.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think we have taken a step forward today with the adoption of this directive. It may not be as bold a step as that proposed by the Commission in 2004, but it is a significant, admirable and desirable one for the future development of the road map, which was also made part of the Stockholm programme adopted in 2009.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it gives me great pleasure to support this report on the right to information in criminal proceedings. I think it is vitally important to ensure that common minimum standards in criminal proceedings are in place. It is essential to grant EU citizens fundamental rights and help overcome the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition. This is one of the key elements, founding principles and cornerstones of the European Union law. This report will certainly help increase trust between judicial authorities and it is very welcome indeed.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I have to say is that we must work collectively so that we have common minimum standards as regards the right to information in criminal proceedings right throughout the European Union.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I wholeheartedly support the initiative to strengthen the area of defence rights in criminal proceedings within the European Union. My country collaborated actively in the Council to ensure that the instrument would be adopted quickly.</p>
      <p sl="it">The aim of the directive is to establish rules on the right of suspected and accused persons to be informed of their rights and the charges against them in criminal proceedings. The provisions of the directive should apply to anyone who is brought to the attention of the relevant authorities in a Member State as being suspected or accused, until the proceedings are concluded. The general right of all suspected and accused persons in criminal proceedings is to be informed, either orally or in writing, of their relevant procedural rights as soon as possible after the proceedings begin.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have voted in favour of the report on the right to information in criminal proceedings as I support the need to guarantee a consistency in basic rights for those who are arrested across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is particularly important with the increased element of cross-border cooperation under the European arrest warrant. It is vitally important that the accused is made aware of having committed a criminal offence by official notification, and they should be fully aware of the relevant procedural rights as soon as possible, which has not always been the case for some British citizens who have been arrested under the European arrest warrant of late.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also crucial for the arrested person to keep the letter of rights throughout their time of detention and this information should be presented in simple and accessible language. I would therefore welcome the proposed directive’s intention to raise the standards in some Member States to a common basic standard which is already operational, if not exceeded, in the majority of Member States, including my own.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, anyone who is suspected or accused of a criminal offence must be informed of their rights, and these rights must be respected. That is the only way equality before the law and the administration of justice can be guaranteed. Along with the right to a fair trial, this equality is already guaranteed throughout the EU. The series of measures of which this directive is a part constitutes the minimum level to which persons involved in criminal proceedings must be informed. The aim is to make it easier to assert these rights. This is necessary because today, we have freedom of movement, freedom of establishment and freedom to work in any Member State, yet legal systems vary from one country to another. Fundamental rights must also be secured where there is freedom of movement, which is why I supported the proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">To give an example: according to some estimates, there are about 100 000 women in Europe who benefit from protection orders. Such measures, however, are currently limited in their effect to the territory where they were adopted or in which the victims live. As a result, there is a legislative gap that this directive fills through the mutual recognition of protection orders in the context of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
      <p sl="it">The instrument to be introduced shortly will, in fact, ensure that a protection order issued in one country will automatically be recognised in any Member State that the victim visits. This is an extremely important result, which, in practical terms, helps to create a European Union area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for in the Treaty.</p>

From today, protection will no longer be contained geographically within a Member State’s borders, but these people – women, in particular – can feel safe and be safe throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I – like the other Members who have spoken – welcome the European Protection Order. I think it is an excellent initiative which will ensure that measures for victims’ protection will extend from one Member State to another, because the problem is that at present, protection orders stop at our borders, leaving the victim defenceless.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EPO marks a huge step forward in victims’ rights as a strong instrument which will provide a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States’ borders, particularly women. Over 100 000 women in the EU are covered by protective measures at present. However, the EPO is not nearly as effective as it might have been.</p>
      <p sl="en">In December 2010, I raised my objection to the Council’s blocking minority argument against the inclusion of civil law measures in the EPO. I had previously outlined that both the Council and the Parliament’s Legal Service found that the legal basis was adequate, a position which was unanimously supported by the Committee on Legal Affairs. I sincerely regret that today’s compromise excludes all civil measures. I hope that Ireland will soon be able to adopt the measure that we have adopted here today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Concerns at that time focused on the issue of the legal basis and scope of the directive, since, according to a restrictive interpretation by the Commission, the scope ought to be limited just to judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
      <p sl="it">The final compromise proposal clearly redefines the boundaries between criminal and civil matters so as to circumscribe the scope of the directive to include only measures issued in respect of criminal proceedings. In my opinion, therefore, it is even better than previous compromise solutions, not least in view of the fact that, alongside this focus on criminal matters, work is already progressing on the corresponding proposal for a regulation on protection measures in civil matters.</p>

The right to travel and settle in another Member State, to find work and set up a family there must also be guaranteed for the victims of crimes and anyone threatened with violence. Borders are no longer a barrier to criminals, and so we should not stand in the way of protecting the victims. No one could have imagined that adopting this directive would take so long. Two years of legislative procedures is really not a short period of time. It will take three more years for Member States to incorporate it into their legislation. Furthermore, this concerns a fundamental freedom which, in contrast to financial and fiscal policy, is key to the existence of a unified Europe.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Protection Order report proposes the creation of an EU-wide protection system which will protect all potential victims and actual victims of violent and physical crimes including rape, domestic abuse and other forms of intimidation. This protection order will therefore ensure fear-free movement of these victims as they continue to live their lives in the EU. I have therefore voted in favour of this report, as it clearly recognises the need to protect these vulnerable individuals who have been subject to these horrendous crimes. Moreover, it sensibly acknowledges the difference between criminal offences and those of a civil nature, such as stalking and harassment. It ensures that civil crimes will continue to be treated under a civil law instrument, rather than under the European Protection Order.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I voted for Ms Mathieu’s report since I strongly believe that immigration in Europe is a great opportunity, but that it must be managed intelligently and fairly. Without effective intervention, the labour market would be divided and a host of low-cost workers would threaten to undermine the achievements of the European social model.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore think this provision will help to prevent and control such a threat by creating a level playing field for the citizens of our countries and for third-country nationals; I am referring, for example, to access to the various kinds of advisory services that the host country makes available. Similarly, I am pleased with the compromises reached on access to education and training and on the portability and transferability of pensions and acquired pension rights, which will no longer depend on whether or not there are bilateral agreements between countries.</p>

The introduction of detailed obligations for the Member States relating to the administrative proceedings concerning applications for residence and work permits may, in fact, prove extremely costly. Taking into account our drive to savings, the imposition of new obligations leading to the creation of additional offices does not seem appropriate. In my view, there is no need to harmonise procedures for these types of applications throughout the Community, especially as the markets of the Member States are not subject to harmonisation. The regulations in force in the countries of the Union perfectly respond to the needs in these matters. Further to the above, I do not think it is necessary to create a common set of rights for workers from outside the Union either. Such issues are already provided for in European law in considerable detail. Any social privileges should be introduced at the level of individual countries’ legislation, taking their particular interests into account.</p>

Pension portability and education across the EU are some of those benefits, but this report suggests introducing a single application procedure and a single residence or work permit for across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fail to see the benefits of harmonising the internal administrative procedures with respect to permanent applications. Since labour markets of Member States are not harmonised, there is no clear EU added value to harmonise these procedures.

We should not, however, throw the principle of subsidiarity to the winds. I should also like to point out that legal migration is not an effective solution to Europe’s demographic crisis. The jobs deficit will increase from year to year. The number of migrants will grow in comparison with the number of people in work. I wonder how many legal migrants we will need in 20 years if we do not succeed in changing this trend? Legalising migration is just buying time. The only effective solution to the demographic problem is family mainstreaming, a policy which takes the interests of the family into account at all times. As long as the Commission and the governments of the Member States do not realise this, we will never have enough legal migrants in Europe.</p>

The fishing industry must be environmentally friendly and sustainable. We can achieve this by a number of different means, including quotas, bans on catching certain species and technical measures. One technical measure involves avoiding unnecessary by-catches. The agreement on a standardised net size is also a move in the right direction, which must be followed by others.

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I voted in favour of adopting the recommendation on a future regulation for fishing within the framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean agreement.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The Mediterranean is the most threatened aquatic ecosystem in Europe. Many species of fish, coral and other animals have been harvested here on such a massive scale that it has led to an irreplaceable loss of certain species. Many others are seriously at risk. The problem is that, within species, individuals with a similar DNA make-up survive, which puts the entire local ecosystem more at risk. A change to the food chain, to pollution or to the climate that is small in itself may lead to the extinction of further species. The activity of this Commission is therefore essential to the protection of biodiversity, reducing the number of possible catches and increasing the number of reservations where fishing is prohibited.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Humanity has, through its approach, made fishing one of the activities most under threat, and humanity must now help to regenerate it. Fishermen may have less work today, but they must also have work in the future. All-out catches would mean the definitive loss of fishing as a sector. It is our duty to preserve species biodiversity and fishing for future generations.</p>

      <p sl="en">I know that in this particular case, there were some concerns about the Western Sahara people and whether their fishing rights were being sold without their being consulted properly, but in general, when we look at the fishing rights with a number of countries, from developing countries, when those fishing rights are given away without the say-so or consultation of local fishermen, what we find is that local fishermen are no longer able to compete with the industrial-sized fishing fleets that come from Europe. These people are no longer able to make a living for themselves, and when they are unable to make a living for themselves, what do they seek to do? They seek to emigrate to a better life, often to European shores. And then what do we do here in Europe? We complain. We complain about the migration from poorer countries.</p>

The ITER project is the most ambitious initiative in the history of nuclear energy, in both scientific and financial terms, involving thousands of scientists across the world. In recent years, the European Union has been contributing decisively to advances in nuclear research, specifically through support for several programmes, particularly this project. Over 50% of the funding for this project is provided by the EU, and the remainder by the following countries: Russia, the United States, China, Japan, India and South Korea. Given that the needs for increasing funding for this project were agreed in the trialogue meeting on 1 December 2011 between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and that the EU should remain at the forefront of research in this area, I am voting for this proposed amendment to Annex I to the aforementioned interinstitutional agreement.</p>

With respect to this funding, the multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 must be revised in accordance with points 21, 22 and 23 of the interinstitutional agreement in order to increase the ceilings for commitment appropriations under heading 1a for 2012 by EUR 650 million and for 2013 by EUR 190 million in current prices. Increasing the ceilings for commitment appropriations under heading 1a will be fully offset by the corresponding decrease of the ceilings for commitment appropriations under headings 2 and 5 for 2011. In order to keep an appropriate relationship between commitments and payments, the annual ceilings for payment appropriations will be adjusted.

This is the crucial difference between ITER and the existing form of nuclear power. Nuclear fission gives rise to long-lasting, highly toxic, radioactive substances that represent a permanent danger to people and the environment. In contrast, the residual products of nuclear fusion are far less radioactive.

The draft budget initially envisaged for nuclear research as part of the multiannual financial framework for the 2007-2013 period is inadequate due to the hefty increase in the ITER project’s costs. In the conclusions it made on 12 July 2010, the Council confirmed the project’s increased financial requirements and agreed to limit the European contribution to EUR 6.6 billion (2008 value) for the ITER construction phase up to 2020, which includes EUR 1.4 billion for the 2012-2013 period.</p>

With the issue of nuclear safety being more topical than ever, restoring the balance – even a tiny bit – between research programmes should be made a requirement. The nature of these additional costs should also be questioned. Not only that: at a time when drastic cuts are being imposed on the people, the Union should think about how it can use such huge amounts more appropriately.

The purpose of the Draft amending budget is to formally enter this budgetary adjustment into the 2011 budget. The quick release of financial assistance through the EUSF for those affected by natural catastrophes is of great importance, and it is therefore of great concern that in the case of the flooding in the Veneto region, the mobilisation of the EUSF will only be effective 13 months after the torrential rainfall that occurred at the end of October 2010. It is necessary that all parties in the Member States, both at local and regional level, as well as national authorities, improve the assessment of needs and coordination for future potential applications to the EUSF with a view to accelerating, as much as possible, the mobilisation of the EUSF.

Parliament’s approval, by a large majority, of EUR 16.9 million in aid for flooded parts of this region has shown that European solidarity does not only exist in words but also in deeds. Obviously, in spite of the amount allowable under the fund’s regulations, we are still a very long way from covering the actual costs of rebuilding infrastructure, and providing accommodation and aid. Indeed, for the purposes of properly restoring the affected areas, the Italian State has estimated that the amount of direct damage comes to EUR 3 717 million. I do not want to linger on the figures, but I should like to highlight that in Padua alone – which is my province – we have seen the following: 3 500 people displaced, 12 municipalities seriously damaged, eight cases of river flooding and six burst banks, meaning that a total area of 72 km2 was left flooded. To conclude, I would like to express my hope that the paths of solidarity and cooperation can converge more effectively in future so as to guarantee the requisite financial support that Europe must ensure to all Member States in the event of disasters.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The Commission has proposed mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund in favour of Spain and Italy. Spain applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund for damage caused by the earthquake in Murcia on 11 May 2011. The town of Lorca was hit by two consecutive earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.2, which killed nine people and injured around 300. The disaster caused widespread damage to residential homes, businesses, public buildings, cultural heritage sites, the road network and basic infrastructure. Under the terms of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the disaster therefore qualifies as an extraordinary regional disaster and falls within the main field of application of the Solidarity Fund ‘under exceptional circumstances’. Italy, meanwhile, applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund following torrential rainfall from 31 October to 2 November 2010 in the Veneto region of north-eastern Italy. The effects of the heavy rainfall were aggravated by a warm Mediterranean Sirocco wind that melted the snow in the nearby mountains. The disaster caused significant damage to road and infrastructure networks, agriculture, businesses and residential homes. As laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the disaster qualifies for aid under the criteria for major natural disasters. After verifying that all applications comply with the eligibility criteria of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed mobilising the Solidarity Fund in favour of Spain and Italy, and I welcome this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="it">I have nothing but praise for Parliament’s decision to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund for the regions affected by natural disasters. The flooding that struck the Veneto region between 31 October and 2 November 2010 caused enormous damage for the population and for the entire social and economic fabric of the region. A great deal of infrastructure was seriously damaged, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the main driving force behind the economy of north-eastern Italy. The EUR 17 million that the EU is putting forward to help Veneto is a real lifeline for local citizens who are struggling – including psychologically – to overcome the memory of those dreadful days. Together with the aid being put forward for Lorca, the area of Spain hit by two violent earthquakes, the European Union is showing that it really does care about people affected by natural disasters.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The number of cases submitted to the European Parliament for approval, their geographic diversity and the range of industries affected constitute sufficient proof of the worrying times the European Union is experiencing. The relocation of their industries to regions of the world where labour costs are significantly lower has led to the closure of many units of production and, consequently, to the unemployment of many thousands of workers who are currently having difficulty returning to work. This is as a result of a retraction in the market and the cautiousness exercised by surviving employers in taking on staff. In the Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, 528 workers from 323 enterprises in the construction sector have experienced this same fate, which I am bound to regret.</p>

On 31 October 2011, the Commission adopted a new proposal for a decision on mobilisation of the EGF for Italy, in order to support the reintegration of workers made redundant because of the global financial and economic crisis, following the aforementioned application, which was submitted on 7 February 2011. This is the 23rd application submitted under the 2011 EU budget, mobilising EUR 3 918 850, with the aim of mitigating the social impact of the redundancy of 643 workers from 323 enterprises in the building and construction sector in the region of Trentino.

      <p sl="pt">This report is in response to the 23rd application for mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) examined under the 2011 budget. It concerns mobilisation of a total sum of EUR 3 918 850 from the EGF for Italy. It results from 643 redundancies, 528 of which are eligible for assistance, from 323 enterprises in the building construction sector. Italy’s building construction sector has been hit hard by the crisis. According to the Italian Government, loans to the building construction sector and to private individuals have been drastically reduced and demand for new residential housing has fallen, owing to declining consumer confidence and the lack of liquidity. The economic situation of both provinces under consideration here – Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol – deteriorated in 2009, and their growth was negative. Italy predicts the redundancies will have a significant impact at local level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We voted for mobilisation of the EGF so as to support the redundant workers. However, at the same time, we would reiterate here our criticism of both the unfair way in which the EGF is regulated and the fact that nothing is being done to avoid its repeated mobilisation. On the contrary, the policies implemented by the EU are merely sowing the seeds of other crises, meaning further redundancies and requests for mobilisation of the EGF can be envisaged.</p>

In February this year, Italy submitted request No EGF/2011/002 IT/Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol for a financial contribution from the EGF on account of 643 redundancies in 323 enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 41 (‘Construction of buildings’) in the NUTS II region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (ITD1 and ITD2) in Italy. According to statements by the relevant authorities, the financial and economic crisis has resulted in a sudden collapse of the global economy and has had a major impact on many industries, including redundancies in the construction sector which could not be foreseen and which could not be easily avoided. After considering the request thoroughly, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, the Commission has come to the conclusion that they meet the conditions for a financial contribution under the regulation. I also believe that providing immediate financial compensation to Italy is justified.</p>

The EGF aims to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Italy, which has applied for assistance in relation to 643 redundancies – 528 of which are eligible for assistance – from 323 enterprises in NACE Revision 2 Division 41 (‘Construction of buildings’) in the NUTS II region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (ITD1 and ITD2) in Italy.</p>

The European Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice. According to the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999, the principle of mutual recognition should become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union, because enhanced mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments and the necessary approximation of legislation would facilitate cooperation between authorities and the judicial protection of individual rights. The extent of the mutual recognition exercise is very much dependent on a number of parameters, including mechanisms for safeguarding the rights of suspected or accused persons and common minimum standards necessary to facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition. This is at the heart of the rule of law, and I therefore agree with the rapporteur that this directive should apply to suspected and accused persons regardless of their legal status, citizenship or nationality.

If correctly implemented, the provisions of this directive will make the rights of suspects and accused persons much more effective by ensuring that they receive information about their rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Ms Sippel’s report, which aims to set common minimum rules on the right to information in criminal proceedings in the EU. Suspected and accused persons are entitled to be informed of their rights and this information must always be explained in accessible, simple terms and in a language that the suspected or accused person understands. Moreover, specific information will have to be provided in writing in the event of deprivation of liberties by the competent authorities of Member States during criminal proceedings.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I agree with two specific rights that have been added to the report, alongside the general right to be informed about procedural rights: the right to information about the charge and the right to access the case file when this does not lead to serious risk to the life of another person or will not seriously harm the internal security of the Member State. This directive will improve the rights of suspected and accused persons, ensuring that they receive timely information about their rights.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I voted for the adoption of the directive, which deals with EU citizens and their rights when they become participants in criminal proceedings. If this happens, whether in somebody’s home country or in another Member State, a fair judicial procedure in line with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights must be ensured. This implies compliance with basic procedural rights, such as the right to consult a lawyer or to have interpretation and translation of documents if needed. I consider it beneficial that this report amends the Commission proposal in order to ensure that the directive covers all cases of limitation of personal freedom, irrespective of how Member States qualify the proceedings according to which a suspect has been deprived of his/her liberty. Nobody knows in advance how long a suspect will be kept in police custody or for how long the person will be deprived of his/her liberty. While the various rights mentioned in the Letter of Rights might not always apply, the suspected or accused person is nonetheless entitled to be provided immediately with information in writing on his/her procedural rights.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In order to overcome the deadlock in the Council since 2004, it was decided at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 30 November 2009 to initiate a step-by-step approach, in which procedural rights in the context of criminal proceedings should be dealt with in stages, and a road map was agreed setting out six measures as the basis for future action.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The first measure, approved last year, consists of the right to translation and interpretation. This initiative is the second of these measures and consists of the right to information in criminal proceedings, setting out minimum standards to be applied regarding the information to be provided to those suspected or accused of having committed a criminal offence – irrespective of legal status, citizenship or nationality – on their rights and the charges brought against them. The information must be provided in simple and accessible language, and in a language that the individual in question understands. Knowledge of their rights is a first step towards ensuring that these will be respected, since failure to observe them does not just jeopardise equality in criminal proceedings, but could also lead to judicial errors.</p>

Article 48 of the Charter guarantees respect for the rights of the defence. The European Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing the area of freedom, security and justice. It is necessary for the principle of mutual recognition to become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the European Union, since enhanced mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments and the necessary approximation of legislation would facilitate cooperation between individual authorities and the judicial protection of individual rights. The extent of the mutual recognition exercise is very much dependent on a number of parameters, which include mechanisms for safeguarding the rights of suspects and common minimum standards necessary to facilitate the application of the principle of mutual recognition. I am convinced that mutual recognition can only function effectively in an atmosphere of trust, whereby not only judicial authorities, but all actors in criminal processes, see decisions of the judicial authorities of other Member States as equivalent to their own, implying trust not only in the adequacy of one’s partner’s rules, but also the confidence that those rules are applied correctly.</p>

      <p sl="hu">It is welcome that legislators and other parties involved in law making place increasingly strong emphasis on taking children’s rights into account when drafting laws in the field of justice and, in particular, when laying down the minimum norms applicable in criminal proceedings.

Child victims are exposed to a much higher degree of suffering than adults. I therefore welcome the fact that the legislation on the right to information was enacted by taking all these aspects into account, and I hope that this approach will prevail during the drafting of the directive on the right of access to lawyers as well. I would specifically like to highlight Hungary’s efforts and dedication in respect of the broad application and reinforcement of children’s rights, which also extend to the field of justice.

This is an ambitious programme, especially as regards procedural guarantees, and one that involves the establishment of a minimum set of procedural rights for individuals facing criminal proceedings. It is essential to strengthen the rights of these individuals, and a balance must be restored between the considerable progress made with regard to cooperation on the accusation side, and the growing backwardness regarding the right of defence.

Notably, consideration is being given to criminal law, in its broad sense, or criminal procedural law, more specifically. However, it is certain that the area of freedom, which enables the free movement of people, has also broken with the isolationist paradigm of various legal and criminal systems. The reality is that crime is, in some areas at least, European, and does not recognise the constraints offered by geographic borders. As such, there is justification for taking the first steps towards bringing the legislation of the various Member States closer together. That is the aim of this proposal for a directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings. In light of the issues covered, it is a case of including in the acquis communautaire certain key elements that are in the DNA of the concept of due process: the accused person’s right to be informed of their rights, the right to be informed of the charge and the right of access to the case file.

      <p sl="en">In favour. Ensuring that common minimum standards in criminal proceedings are in place would better protect EU citizens’ fundamental rights and also help overcome the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in criminal matters, because there may be a lack of trust between judicial authorities. Following the failure of the adoption of a horizontal legal instrument on procedural rights in criminal proceedings (2004 Commission Proposal for a Framework Decision), the Council opted for a step by step approach and, on 30 November 2009, adopted a road map on procedural rights, inviting the Commission to table a series of legislative proposals corresponding to the measures listed in the road map. The proposal for a directive on the right to information in criminal matters presented by the European Commission in July 2010 is the second step of the list of measures contained in the road map on procedural rights. It aims to set common minimum standards as regards the right to information in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union. The first step, on the right to interpretation and translation, is a directive adopted on 8 October 2010.</p>

      <p sl="pt">These new rules mean those suspected of a criminal offence will have to be informed of their rights in a language they understand. This measure will enable the Member States of the European Union to ensure that all those who are in custody or are the subject of a European arrest warrant will be given a Letter of Rights comprising their fundamental rights during criminal proceedings.

This directive will also cover the use of the European arrest warrant. With regard to the information in criminal proceedings, the Commission proposal states that this must be in understandable language. It also gives the right to information about the accusation and the restricted right to access the case file. Parliament’s report adds the right to translation and the right to be informed about the conditions for obtaining access to a lawyer free of charge. I have voted in favour.</p>

This vital piece of legislation has taken two readings to come to the proper formula for European citizens. The resolution provides a common minimum standard with regard to the right to information in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union. If correctly implemented, it will improve the rights of suspects and accused persons by ensuring that they receive information about their rights in their own language. We have developed this legislation to prevent citizens who are travelling in other Member States from being unaware of what they are being accused of and thus allowing them a better opportunity to properly defend themselves. All citizens of the Union are granted fundamental rights regardless of what Member State they are in and should always have access to the proper information in their own language through all legal proceedings.</p>

Previously, he had worked as an auditor at the Belgian Court of Auditors, as a mayor, then as a Member of the European Parliament and as adviser to the Finance Minister, and finally as Minister for Defence and Minister for Agriculture and SMUs.

Created in 1975, its objectives are auditing the EU’s accounts and improving its financial management. The Court of Auditors may carry out audits of any person or organisation responsible for managing EU funds, and their conclusions are submitted in writing in the form of reports, which are sent to the Commission and the governments of the EU Member States.

      <p sl="hu">Ville Itälä has extensive experience in the field of public administration, as evidenced by his activities as Finnish Minister for the Interior and his work at the Bank of Finland and the fund set up in honour of the 50th anniversary of Finnish independence. Areas in which he has obtained exceptional experience so far are funds management, reporting, accounting and administrative auditing. As a Minister, he had a key part in the implementation of the strict budgetary policy that contributed to the recovery of the Finnish economy. It was during his ministerial term that the new budgeting system and the new, restructured funding model of Finland’s police administration were introduced. His career so far and his work in the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and Committee on Budgetary Control have provided him with a suitable professional background to fill the position of European Auditor. His answers to the Committee’s questions reveal that he intends to perform his work in line with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. According to his statement to the Committee, he supports the Committee on Budgetary Control in reinforcing its role and significance in budgetary control. He also shares the Committee’s opinion that Parliament should be granted access to all documents necessary to perform control.</p>

In the beginning, he was responsible for auditing the European Union’s banking activities and European agencies. In 2002, he was appointed Member of the Court in charge of the DAS, responsible for the auditing of the EU’s annual accounts and the Statement of Assurance. In 2008, he was elected President of the European Court of Auditors, and was re-elected in 2011 for a further three years. He obtained his extraordinary professional experience in the top financial positions previously filled by him. Additionally, as the President, he is responsible for supervising the performance of the institution’s work, for relations with the EU institutions and international auditing organisations, and for the organisation’s internal audit. As regards his ideas for the future, the candidate stated that he intends to steer the development of the strategy of the European Court of Auditors for the period after 2013. His goal is to enable the organisation to better take advantage of its new internal rules and to promote effective public accountability. His expertise and ideas make him suitable to fill the position and I therefore support his application.</p>

I support the position of the rapporteur that the new legal instrument will significantly help those who suffer from violence and wish to lead a normal life. The EPO was first conceived to be a tool to protect victims of gender violence, but it will also cover victims of any crime, such as victims of human trafficking, genital mutilation, organised crime and terrorism, as long as they have an identified perpetrator. An EPO may also be requested to safeguard relatives of a beneficiary of a protection order. An EPO would only apply to protection measures taken on criminal matters, but it will be complemented by separate legislation on the mutual recognition of protection afforded by civil law. I agree that this instrument has to be further developed but it is a very important first step to show that the EU stands strongly against gender violence or any other type of violence, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>

The ultimate goal is to avoid new criminal acts and to reduce the consequences of previous criminal acts and enhance victims’ protection. This directive is focused on protection measures taken in criminal matters and, given the different legal traditions in the Member States in this field, this instrument will therefore have to be complemented in future by a similar mechanism for mutual recognition of protection measures taken in civil matters. The Council has also committed itself to ensuring that this instrument will complement the provisions of the directive on the European Protection Order and that the combined scope of application of the two instruments will enable cooperation among Member States, irrespective of the nature of their national systems, in order to provide the victims with as many protection measures as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because with it, we in the European Parliament have taken a major step towards the creation of a single system for the protection of the victims of crime throughout the European Union. The European Protection Order is a document obliging law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union Member States to cooperate in future in protecting victims or potential victims of crime. This means that once the law enforcement authorities have adopted the decision that victims or potential victims of crime need special protection to enable actual or impending danger to be averted in future, such a decision should apply throughout the European Union. Thus, for instance, once the law enforcement authorities in Lithuania have decided that there is a real threat to a person’s life, physical, psychological or sexual integrity, and have consequently afforded that person protection, their decision would also apply in another EU Member State. When a person is travelling or moving to another EU Member State due to a threat, the foreign law enforcement authorities should therefore take over the protection of that person in their own country.</p>

However, in view of the differences between the legal systems in the different Member States, the country to which the citizen moves can apply another type of measure, whether criminal, administrative or civil, with the aim of promoting the same level of protection as that which they previously received.

The initiative focuses on crimes that may endanger the victim’s life, their physical, psychological or sexual wellbeing, or personal freedom, whereby the protection measures offered by a Member State should be maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person moves.

This new EPO will ensure that criminal law barring and protection orders issued in participating Member States will be recognised and enforced in other participating Member States, upon application. I regret that Ireland has not opted-in to this legislation. I appreciate the legal difficulties at stake – barring orders are nearly always a matter of civil law in Ireland and this directive only covers criminal law orders – but I do hope that these can be overcome before the late 2013 deadline for transposition. I welcome the Irish Government’s announcement of its general intention to take part in the draft regulation on civil law European Protection Orders, as proposed by the Commission last May. Domestic violence has a higher rate of repeat victimisation than any other crime. Both of these measures will allow the victims and potential victims of violence to move more easily around the EU, whilst hampering the movement of their aggressors. The sooner these measures are in force in Ireland, the better.</p>

With this act, we are also ensuring for people the right to mobility without the fear of losing protection from perpetrators of such crimes.

      <p sl="pt">For a long time, criminal proceedings, at least in countries that had an Inquisition, have focused on the relationship between the authorities and the criminal, with the prevailing view that the legal problem that is raised mainly – or solely – concerns the violation of assets that are vital to the community. In other words, this was seen as a matter of public law. Moreover, the reference to the application of the penalty as the counterfactual stabilisation of the expectations of the community in respect of the validity of the rule that has been violated is well known. However, despite being able to provide an array of criminal policy guidance, this approach neglects the role of the victim. Damage to public assets is often accompanied by crimes against personal goods and the violation of private interests. The legislative process aimed at adopting a European Protection Order for victims of crimes comes within this context and seeks to provide the systems of the different Member States with instruments that allow them to protect victims from having further crimes perpetrated against them, as well as meeting the public aims of prosecution.

The European Parliament has adopted a series of measures establishing greater European protection for victims of crime, who will be protected in the same way throughout the European Union. The main beneficiaries of these measures will be victims of gender-based violence, harassment, kidnapping, stalking or attempted murder. While victim protection measures are already in place in every EU country, they are insufficient since they do not cover victims who have moved elsewhere and are therefore often left defenceless. Consequently, this is a real development for victims and their families, whose dignity and integrity are protected within the European Union through judicial and police cooperation between Member States. This is not about wanting Europe to act as a shield; it is about creating a European protection area for particularly fragile and vulnerable people.

Protection measures exist in all EU Member States, but they cease to have effect when an individual crosses a country’s borders. This European Protection Order aims to ensure that the protection offered to an individual in one Member State will be maintained and continued in any other Member State to which the person relocates or has been relocated.</p>

      <p sl="en">This report lays out crucial safeguards for victims of crime wishing to live in another Member State. In the past, there has been no recognition of protection orders from one Member State by another, but the European Protection Order offers victims of crimes such as domestic violence, stalking and abduction equal protection in whichever country in the EU they reside. The EPO does this by enabling victims to move country whilst hampering the efforts of their aggressors to make advances towards their victims once they have moved. In an EU with the free movement of people at its heart, this is a crucial tool in combating both violent and psychological crimes by using the broadest possible range of protection measures issued by Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this report, which is intended to harmonise protection across the Member States for victims of various crimes: sexual violence, harassment, kidnapping, persecution or attempted murder. In theory, the aim is as much to prevent these crimes as to reduce their impact on victims. The aim is more specifically to protect individuals affected in terms of their physical and/or sexual integrity. Those individuals are mainly women. It is also to align the Member States’ legislation and legal systems. However, achieving these advances has not been without its difficulties. It took almost a year for the Council to take a position on the first draft voted through by the European Parliament. It is clearly much more difficult to harmonise criminal legislation in the interest of vulnerable people than to amend the Treaties in order to impose budgetary restraint.

      <p sl="lt">This proposal forms part of the EU’s efforts to develop a comprehensive immigration policy. The Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 stressed that the European Union should ensure uniform treatment of third-country nationals residing legally in the territory of the Member States and that they are granted rights and obligations comparable to those of citizens of the EU. Given the demographic challenges in the EU, legal migration and well-managed migration policies should assist Member States in meeting existing and future labour needs and contribute to economic development and the sustainable development of EU Member States. In order to achieve these objectives, this proposal aims to ensure equal rights for all third-country workers residing legally in a Member State, but who do not yet have the right to obtain long-term resident status, and to introduce a single application procedure when issuing a single permit for residence and work. A single permit will enable Member States to better manage and control the presence of third-country nationals in their territories for the purposes of work.</p>

With regard to legal migration, the EU should develop migration policies that fully respect the powers of the Member States, with the aim of helping them respond to the current and future needs of the labour force, and contributing to the sustainable development of all countries. It thus aims to introduce a procedure to give a single residence and work permit to legal immigrants, and to grant them a common set of rights throughout the EU. The aim of this is to simplify the procedures so that the national authorities can issue a single residence and work permit to legal migrants, as well as granting them a set of rights that are equivalent to those of the workers of the Member States in which they are living, for instance, in relation to working conditions, including pay and dismissal, freedom of association and affiliation with trade unions, recognition of qualifications, social security and access to public services.

      <p sl="fr">The single permit was a commendable initiative at first. Today’s vote is a step forward, but the directive is still far from the idea we had of a framework directive. The single permit should, in fact, have been the framework directive for an immigration package, establishing the same conditions for all according to the principle of equal treatment, without excluding categories of workers. Yet the risk here is that we will have a fragmented labour market: equal treatment comes with many exceptions, and certain categories of workers are excluded from the scope. The outcome is therefore mixed, but the current negotiations on sector-based directives following on from the single permit are ongoing, and give us the opportunity to do better. We in the European Parliament are today advocating a progressive vision of the right to free movement and social rights for a particularly vulnerable category: that of seasonal workers. This immigration package will not represent progress unless it includes improved living and working conditions for third-country workers.</p>

We have attempted to reach the best possible solution that would be acceptable for all third-country workers legally residing and working in European Union Member States and, consequently, there have been rather lengthy discussions and negotiations with the Council. Unfortunately, we have failed to find a solution in the European Parliament itself regarding the inclusion of individual categories of workers in the scope of this directive, i.e. the inclusion of seasonal workers, workers transferred within a company and asylum seekers. As a result, this directive will not be the framework directive that was supposed to facilitate administrative procedures and regulate the arrival of third-country workers and their employment in EU Member States. This directive therefore does not entirely strengthen the principle of legal equivalence for third-country workers. Although agreement could not be reached on all issues, provision was made in the final agreement on this directive for the portability of pensions and the right of third-country workers to vocational training.</p>

The Single Permit Directive therefore supplements other measures regarding legal immigration, such as the Blue Card, and should also facilitate immigration insofar as it responds to the needs of the European labour market. The ‘single permit’ will significantly reduce the amount of red tape, enabling workers to obtain a work and residence permit through a single application procedure. Holders of a single permit will be able to enjoy a set of basic rights comparable to those of EU workers, such as essential decent working conditions, recognition of qualifications, the right to become a member of a trade union, and the right to have access to pensions and social security.

The ageing of the European population, with the exception of Eastern Europe, has led to a shortage of skilled workers in some sectors, especially in the primary sector. This situation has been mitigated thanks to immigration from the east and from North Africa. In some Member States, their productivity accounts for 2% of GDP. It is therefore only fair to assist their lives through a single residence and work permit, as well as granting them rights that are equivalent to those of national workers in terms of working conditions, social security and access to public services.

We also need to try to create a single set of rights for third-country nationals legally residing and working in a Member State of the European Union. The demand for foreign labour is constantly changing, and legal immigration could play a positive role in economic development and competitiveness. If third-country nationals show an interest in working in a European Union Member State, a uniform procedure for the handling of applications for residence and access to the labour market would significantly simplify the often complex administrative steps relating to the admission of economic migrants. Member States will thus also, among other things, be allowed to respond more flexibly to the demand for labour and manpower and, at the same time, an opportunity will be provided to fight against exploitation and discrimination, which workers often face. A certain level of legal certainty and transparency is, however, undoubtedly necessary when adopting the decisions of the competent national authorities in matters regarding the handling of these applications, as they have a significant impact on the lives of the applicants. For this reason, it is important that they are considered as objectively as possible. Similarly, unemployed third-country nationals in Member States should be given access to vocational training and preparation for future jobs or careers.</p>

However, the new law does allow a degree of discretion to Member State – EU countries will be able to apply some specific restrictions to these rights and ultimately still retain the power to decide whether or not to admit non-EU workers. The directive aims to strike a balance between plugging the gaps of the EU labour market with the skills and knowledge of non-EU nationals while, at the same time, ensuring that Member States are not strained financially and that the public and social services capacity of any given Member State is not overstepped because of an influx of third-country nationals which the Member State in question is unable to shoulder.</p>

That is why I voted for this new text, which establishes a simpler, faster single application procedure for those wishing to come and work on the territory of a State, and guarantees a common set of rights for workers. Of course, this text is not perfect. I would have liked it to have been much more comprehensive and not to have excluded certain categories of workers such as posted or seasonal workers.

In addition, a common set of rights is being introduced which will put migrants on an equal footing with nationals, in other words, by providing the same tax relief, trade union rights and social security benefits. The question also arises as to who should pay for all of this. The heavily indebted euro area countries will undoubtedly not be able to. Furthermore, migrants are much more likely to become unemployed and are less well qualified. Under this system, it is mainly migrants who would benefit from claiming social security, because they belong to a group with a particularly low employment rate and are more likely to suffer from poverty.

The EU is a contracting party; the recommendations are binding on the EU and should therefore be transposed, where their content is not already covered by EU legislation, into EU law.

While, on the one hand, it is true that businesses – irrespective of their size – need to draw up accounts for tax and statistical purposes, to assess various aspects of their operations and to make it easier to deal with banks, it is also true that the complexity of some accounting rules is a cost, in terms of time and money, that has a greater effect on micro-entities than big businesses. I understand that some Member States wanted to change the thresholds for this exemption and I congratulate the rapporteur for having succeeded in mediating without losing sight of the initial goal: reducing bureaucratic burdens and leaving small and very small business owners free to do their work, to innovate, and get back to generating wealth and wellbeing.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This recommendation for second reading, by Mr Lehne, is aimed at the adoption of the directive of Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 78/660/EEC on the annual accounts of certain types of companies as regards micro-entities, that is, a subgroup of micro-enterprises, the majority of which operate their business at a local level. It concerns a definition that is not included in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, which defines micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, but which sets them out for accounting reasons. Like other companies, micro-entities are obliged to publish their accounts annually, which represents a significant burden in view of their turnover. However, Member States may exempt micro-entities from having to publish their accounts under certain conditions. The aim of this directive is therefore to facilitate business activity for micro-entities by reducing the administrative burden. Given the importance of these companies for the local economy and their contribution to national GDP, I welcome the proposals to amend the amounts up to which they can be granted exemption, namely, changing the balance sheet total from EUR 250 000 to EUR 350 000, and the net turnover from EUR 500 000 to EUR 700 000, and I am voting for this recommendation.</p>

It is intended that the Member States should be authorised to exempt micro-entities from the general publication requirement, provided that balance sheet information is duly filed, in accordance with national law, with at least one designated competent authority, and that the information is transmitted to the business register.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, the Member States will be able to grant exemption from some of the obligations set out in the current directive to companies which, on their balance sheet dates, do not exceed the limits of two of the following three criteria: balance sheet total, EUR 350 000; net turnover, EUR 700 000; average number of employees during the financial year, 10.</p>
      <p sl="pt">While we recognise the importance of alleviating some of the constraints, which are manifold and ever greater, that are weighing on micro and small enterprises, particularly in this time of recession and severe crisis, this proposal departs from the Commission’s initial proposal in some respects, so we have some reservations.</p>

Accounting has been identified as one of the key areas for reducing administrative burdens for companies within the EU. The High-Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, in its opinion of 10 July 2008, called for rapid enactment of an option for Member States to exempt micro-entities from the obligation to draw up annual accounts in accordance with Directive 78/660/EEC. Subsequently, in its resolution of 18 December 2008 on accounting requirements as regards small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly micro-entities, the European Parliament called on the Commission to present a legislative proposal that would allow Member States to exempt micro-entities from the scope of this directive. The objective of this directive, namely, to reduce administrative burdens on micro-entities, cannot be achieved to a sufficient degree by the Member States, and therefore, because of its effects, can be better achieved at EU level. For this reason, too, it would be appropriate to amend Directive 78/660/EEC accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am pleased to see that the report just presented introduces enhancements to European legislation, a process I have been personally involved in for many years. In 2007, the European Commission identified 42 regulations in 13 priority areas representing something between EUR 115 and EUR 130 billion in administrative costs. It was on this basis that the action plan to reduce the administrative burdens for European enterprises by 25% by 2012 was approved in March 2007.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Moreover, the European Economic Recovery Plan called on Member States and the EU to take immediate steps to reduce the administrative burdens for SMEs and micro-entities. On 29 February 2009, the European Commission prepared the proposed amendments to Directive 78/660/EEC on the annual accounts of certain types of companies. This was only the beginning of improvements.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we need more solutions, and those proposed by the rapporteur, which introduce exemptions for micro-entities, in accordance with the principle of ‘Think Small First’, are very appropriate. The justification for them should be the fact that 93% of Europe’s micro-entities do not engage in cross-border activity, and thus there is no need for harmonisation of accounting at their level. The remaining 7% may draw up such reports if their partners so require.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I support the compromise amendment to Article 1 tabled by the rapporteur, which excludes micro-entities acquiring more than 10% of their overall profit from cross-border activities from the exemption. I agree with the changes proposed in the report. They are good news for approximately 5.2 million micro-enterprises across the EU, and a good step towards the creation of better and citizen-friendly EU law.</p>

In this case, the obligation laid down in Article 47 of Directive 78/660/EEC to publish all accounting documents in accordance with Article 3(5) of Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, would not apply. Member States may provide for exemptions from certain obligations under this directive in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 in respect of companies which, on their balance sheet dates, do not exceed the limits of two of the three following criteria (micro-entities): balance sheet total: EUR 350 000; net turnover: EUR 700 000; annual number of employees during the financial year: 10.

I therefore welcomed the Commission’s proposal to temporarily increase the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate for programmes running in Member States which receive support under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (currently Greece, Ireland and Portugal) and the balance of payments facility for non-euro area Member States (currently Latvia and Romania). This temporary increase in Community cofinancing, provided on the basis of an application submitted by the Member State concerned, would help to reduce the amount of matching national funding required in the 2011 and 2012 budget years.

The Commission’s proposal for a regulation proposes temporarily increasing the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate (up to 95%) for programmes running in Member States which receive support under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (Greece, Ireland and Portugal) and the balance of payments facility for non-euro area Member States (Latvia, Hungary and Romania). Due to budgetary constraints, some Member States that receive assistance under aid programmes risk failing to fulfil their commitments and losing Community support (unless they provide proof that they are allocating matching national funding no later than two years after the year initially set for the payment). The instrument proposed by the Commission will enable these Member States to reduce their contribution when cofinancing projects with the European Union. Possibilities will thus arise to release funds already allocated from the EU Cohesion Fund and Rural Development or Fisheries Funds earlier and to begin implementing programmes postponed due to a lack of national funding.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As a result of the current economic, financial and social crisis that is affecting Europe, some Member States are facing budgetary restraints, which may prevent them from fulfilling their commitments to cofinanced EU programmes. These Member States thus risk losing EU support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. This report adopts the increased rates of cofinancing for EU rural development funds intended for Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Romania and Latvia, and the EU’s contribution can cover 95% of the total costs of projects in this area. These measures will remain in force until the end of 2013. The aim is therefore to help the economic recovery of these countries, allowing programmes to be launched that would not have been implemented until then due to a lack of national funding.

      <p sl="fr">With the adoption of Paolo De Castro’s report, the EU finally seems capable of proving that it is both useful and unified. In order to respond to the context of the crisis, Europe has decided to take transitional measures until the end of 2013. It will grant Member States in financial difficulty, such as Greece, Romania and Portugal, very favourable cofinancing rates of up to 95% so that they can finance rural development projects and hence encourage economic recovery. I supported the increase in EAFRD cofinancing rates in order to ensure that those EU countries with poor growth prospects and weakened public finances do not see the implementation of their projects stopped on the ground. However, this positive policy of supporting countries in financial difficulty with regard to rural development should be accompanied by a similar policy for their regional development projects. By creating synergy between the projects financed by the various European funds, we can make an effective and sustainable contribution to the economic development and growth of those States.</p>

This temporary increase in community cofinancing, provided on application of the Member State concerned, would reduce the amount of matching national funds needed in the budget years 2011 and 2012. It would thus contribute to an overall economic recovery in these Member States. I consider it important that the Commission proposal foresees no additional commitment appropriations. The additional payment appropriations needed to finance the increased EU support shall be transferred from the 2013 budget year to the 2011 and 2012 budget years.

      <p sl="en">I voted against this legislation as it simply throws more money at the EU’s failing economies. It is unacceptable that UK taxpayers’ money will be used to pay up to 95% of the costs of rural development projects in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Latvia and Romania to help spur economic recovery when the UK deficit is only controllable due to the fact that we chose not to join the single currency. Our wisdom more than a decade ago to not join the euro must not be used against us now as the euro fails to fund the resultant problems occurring in single currency Member States and other nations in the EU. These higher cofinancing rates for states in financial difficulty would be applied on a temporary basis only, until the end of 2013, but what kind of guarantee would the UK have that this legislation would not be continued or that the recipient nations would spend the funding wisely?

Several Member States are facing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, notably, problems in their economic growth and financial stability and with a deterioration in their deficit and debt position, as a result, among other things, of the international economic and financial situation. Despite the fact that important actions to counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including amendments to the legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, the labour market and the citizens is widely felt and visible. The pressure on national financial resources is increasing and further steps should be taken to alleviate that pressure through the maximum and optimal use of the funding from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). In order to facilitate the management of Union funding, to help accelerate the investments in Member States and regions concerned, and to increase the impact of the funding on the economy, I believe it is necessary to allow an increase in the EAFRD contribution rate up to a maximum of 95% of eligible public expenditure in the regions eligible under the convergence objective and 85% of eligible public expenditure in other regions which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the context of the current economic crisis, some Member States are facing budgetary constraints which might prevent them from fulfilling their commitments in cofinanced Community programmes such as EAFRD. I welcome this proposal by the Commission to temporarily increase the maximum European Union cofinancing rate for such programmes running in Member States that are subject to support of the EFSM (currently Greece, Ireland and Portugal) and the balance of payments facility for non-eurozone Member States (Latvia and Romania). This temporary increase would reduce the amount of matching national funds needed in budget years 2011 and 2012 and would thus help to make programmed funds available for the rural economy and contribute to an overall economic recovery in these Member States.</p>

Mr De Castro’s report, for which I voted, seeks to increase the rate of EU cofinancing for programmes which are running, in other words, to grant the possibility of additional financing to try to meet the State in difficulty halfway in order to avoid more serious difficulties, in the hope that the Member States in question will be able to cope with the emergency.</p>

The proposal to increase the EU cofinancing rate falls within the same area, in the context of the structural and cohesion funds, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Fisheries Fund, benefiting countries that are covered by the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, or the balance of payments facility for those that do not belong to the euro area.

Against this background, the Commission proposes to temporarily increase the Union’s maximum cofinancing rate for programmes running in Member States that are subject to support by the EFSM (Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010, currently Greece, Ireland and Portugal) and the balance of payment facility for non-eurozone Member States (Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002, currently Latvia and Romania).

I agree with this initiative as I believe that it will not lead to changes to the funding of cohesion policy, but rather to advancement in the funds granted to the Member States.

The Commission should raise the issue of NTBs with all of the EU’s trading partners, above all, with the strategic partners with whom the EU does most of its trade.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. EU companies with activities in third countries continue to face major barriers. Non-tariff barriers (NTBs) remain one of the greatest problems and refer to all trade restricting measures other than import duties (tariffs) that limit imports. NTBs include direct price influencers (such as export subsidies or drawbacks, countervailing and anti-dumping duties, exchange rate manipulations, methods of import valuation, customs surcharges, unreasonable standards and inspection procedures), and indirect price influencers (such as import licensing, import quotas and ‘voluntary’ export restraints). Removing or reducing unjustified NTBs and other regulatory obstacles applied by the EU’s key strategic partner countries by means of regulatory dialogue should be one of the key regulatory priorities of the new EU trade policy under the Europe 2020 strategy. The issue of access to public procurement for EU companies in third countries also needs to be addressed. Public procurement procedures in the EU’s strategic partner countries tend to be closed to foreign participants and are still relatively unaffected by international commitments, while the EU is much more open than other countries in this regard. Under EU law, European and foreign companies can tender for European public contracts without discrimination, and the EU must therefore become more involved and reach agreements with its main trading partners to give European companies fair and equitable access to procurement procedures in third countries.</p>

The bilateral and plurilateral negotiations are also a good opportunity for the Commission to step up regulatory cooperation with the EU’s main trading partners. In my opinion, the Commission should act proactively to reduce the restrictive impact of non-tariff barriers on the capacity of European businesses to access foreign markets. This shall be a priority of the new EU trade policy under the Europe 2020 strategy. Furthermore, with respect to free trade agreements (FTAs) between the EU and third countries, it is vital to make sure that these provide sufficient reciprocity in market access and mutual benefits to both parties.

In view of the rapid growth in global trade outside the European Union, the Commission must urgently draw up a legislative proposal on an instrument for reciprocity in respect of access to third-country government procurement markets. The impact of foreign direct investment on the internal market also needs to be evaluated so as to forestall any potential adverse effects on European innovation and know-how in certain strategic sectors.

      <p sl="sk">The rule-based multilateral trading system, which was established under the aegis of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), is the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade and guaranteeing the development of fair and equitable global trade rules. Efforts are still needed to reform the WTO with a view to making it more democratic and efficient and clarifying its relations with other key international organisations. The EU should continue to give priority to achieving a balanced outcome from the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), which would support the integration of developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, into the international trading system and contribute to establishing and enforcing fairer and more equitable multilateral trade rules among all its members. EU exporters often face many types of restriction in foreign markets. The EU should therefore actively defend its industries, whenever necessary, against violations of agreed rules and WTO standards and principles by its trading partners, using all available means, including multilateral and bilateral dispute resolution mechanisms and WTO-compatible trade defence instruments. All barriers resulting from the inconsistent implementation of bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral trade rules are unjustified, and regulatory dialogue should, in particular, respect the right of all states to enhance human rights, environmental rules, social rules and public health.</p>

It is a fact: the European Union still comes up against unjustifiable tariff and regulatory barriers erected by some of its partners, which limits both our companies’ access to these high growth potential markets and investment. By 2015, 90% of global growth will be generated outside the European Union. This is a parameter we cannot ignore. The future of our companies will also be at stake outside our borders. That is why I support the measures proposed in this report to lift these unjustifiable restrictions: a Commission-compiled inventory of key barriers, the establishment of an early warning mechanism, and a strengthening of public procurement disciplines which could lead to the presentation of an instrument for reciprocity in respect of access to third-country government procurement markets by next year.</p>

I believe that any barriers resulting from the incoherent implementation of bilateral and multilateral trade rules are unjustified. Regulatory dialogue should respect the right of all states to strengthen human rights, environmental rules, social rules and public health. The Commission should draw a clear distinction between those NTBs which give rise to unfair distortions of competition and those which reflect legitimate public policy aims, notably in relation to public health and the protection of the environment.

This is particularly important because, by 2015, 90% of global growth will be generated outside the European Union. It is therefore necessary to clearly identify the barriers that hamper trade between the European Union and its trading partners, and to remove them in order to help our companies gain market share abroad. Reforming European trade policy according to the principles of reciprocity, equity and fair competition should be one of our priorities. I am also pleased to see that the European Parliament supports the idea of considering, at European level, an evaluation of the impact of foreign direct investment on the internal market so as to forestall any potential adverse effects on European innovation and know-how in certain strategic sectors.

As a liberal, I believe that free trade should be promoted and protectionism should be combated. In the first round, we must adopt free trade agreements with China and other important trading partners, which, in time, may become full WTO agreements. Unfortunately, things are heading in the wrong direction in these areas, as the report points out. Lastly, I would like to mention that I am not keen on the frequent references to reciprocity, as to my mind, this is another word for protectionism. Overall, however, the report is heading in the right direction. In the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am working on getting as many references to reciprocity and protectionism removed or reduced as much as possible in the European Parliament’s reports, and this has also been successful this time.

Firstly, it deals with the purpose of the internal market, and secondly, it covers something about the regulation put forward by the World Trade Organisation, with which the EU is associated. Whatever the basic position that it adopts in this regard, it is certain that, within loose limits, a system of free intermediation in trade translates into what has been called a win-win situation; both the countries, or group of countries, which give up a more protectionist approach will end up making more profit together than individually. In view of this, the reduction of non-tariff barriers is justified, through subtle ways of introducing limitations on international trade, such as export subsidies, anti-dumping duties and exchange rate manipulations. These are barriers that do not follow the ‘formal’ method of introducing a tariff duty. In view of what has been said, a policy action aimed at the gradual abolition of these instruments is justified, while full commitment should be maintained to a system of exceptions, especially for weaker sectors of the economy.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, can I begin by also thanking Mr Lisek for his report. As I said last night when I saw him, I come from the European Defence Agency where they, too, would wish me to express their thanks for the work that he has done.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no debate about the common security and defence policy (CSDP) this year that can ignore the financial crisis which has led to a wave of defence cuts across the European Union. This has resulted in both the increased focus on pooling and sharing of military capabilities and in the current staff shortfalls we are experiencing in important CSDP missions and operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the demand for the EU to do more and better is getting stronger. We need to be able to respond to the complex threats of today – crises from cyber-threats, energy security and others – and we need to assume our global responsibilities whilst showing real value for money. To deliver value for money, we need CSDP action to be based on coherent and effective strategies and a truly comprehensive approach and equipped with the right capabilities, as was restated in the Foreign Affairs Council on 1 December.</p>
      <p sl="en">The budgetary constraints force us to save, but they are also a driver of closer collaboration; whether on pooling and sharing of defence assets, joint programming of development aid, or solidarity in the evacuation of European nationals from scenes of conflict or disaster. The message is clear: doing better with less.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 1 December Foreign Affairs Council endorsed my call to maximise synergies and strengthen cooperation – complementing instead of duplicating each other. I am committed to ensuring that the actions by the External Action Service, the Commission and the EU Member States reinforce rather than compete with each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the meeting of 1 December, we also agreed that the EU needs to improve its operations by more clearly identifying needs and acting with clear objectives and clear exit strategies. The European Parliament, alongside national parliaments and governments, plays an important role in ensuring the democratic oversight of EU foreign, security and defence policy, as recognised in my declaration on political accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to focus for a moment on some important achievements during the course of this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the level of structures, we have established the External Action Service and it is now equipped to deal with crises better, faster and smarter. When the Service was launched in January 2011, the Arab Spring required our immediate response. In light of this experience, we have set up the Crisis Management Board and Crisis Platform, which also dealt effectively with crisis situations in Ivory Coast, Libya and the Horn of Africa. These structures are central to our capacity to respond, and maintain their direct reporting line to me while working closely with the rest of the service.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also improved the early warning capacity through the Situation Room and the Conflict Prevention Group and we are currently exploring how to strengthen the security policy expertise in EU delegations. All of this has been achieved using and restructuring the existing resources and improving their flexibility and efficiency rather than by seeking other expensive and complex solutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are turning a comprehensive approach into comprehensive action and I believe the External Action Service is uniquely placed for this. We can join up all of the instruments of the European Union and cover conflict prevention, development and conflict resolution. We are putting this to full use in the Horn of Africa and in the Southern Neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some people try and say that we are facing some sort of fatigue on CSDP, yet this year has been a year of intensive work on this area, with concrete results, and ending with comprehensive and, I believe, forward-looking Council conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">On military capabilities, the 30 November European Defence Agency Steering Board delivered concrete Member States’ commitments in specific projects, including in areas where the Libya crisis showed our shortfalls. This is a good first step towards more substantial achievements next spring, also in view of the NATO Chicago summit which I will attend.</p>
      <p sl="en">But as indicated by the honourable Member Mr Lisek’s report, there is no alternative to cooperation in this area. Multinational cooperation must become the rule rather than the exception in order to preserve and develop Europe’s defence capabilities. I agree with what Mr Lisek says: pooling and sharing is a means of delivering enhanced capabilities and of offsetting defence budgets cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Head of the European Defence Agency, I will continue to make every effort to facilitate cooperation among and between Member States and to increase the global competitiveness and efficiency of the European defence industry.</p>
      <p sl="en">In July, I presented a comprehensive report on CSDP. It set out the parameters for further work, both in terms of hardware – our military and civilian capabilities – and software – how we plan and conduct operations and engage with our partners. The Foreign Affairs Council on 1 December welcomed my work to strengthen the CSDP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States’ initiatives, such as the Weimar initiative and subsequent contributions, have provided an added impetus to work. I am pleased, too, that we found a pragmatic way forward on the issue of the planning and conduct of CSDP operations. We are now beginning planning for the activation of the operations centre for the Horn of Africa operations by the next Foreign Affairs Council in January. This will allow us to test this tool, with a view to strengthening civilian-military synergies and again to draw lessons for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that we have achieved a lot of progress in working with our partners. In the area of security and defence, the relationship with NATO is essential. It is recognised in the Lisbon Treaty, which is the first of the EU Treaties to explicitly refer to NATO. The breadth of EU instruments can be usefully combined with the depth of NATO’s role on defence. The two organisations can and should reinforce each other’s work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have worked hard to establish a good, close working relationship with NATO Secretary-General Rasmussen, to bring the EU and NATO closer through a pragmatic step-by-step approach, while maintaining the overall objective of a true organisation-to-organisation relationship.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Libya crisis again showed a clear need for this. We work hand in hand in many theatres, and we owe it to our people in the field. I am also pleased to confirm that on capabilities in particular – whether labelled pooling and sharing or smart defence – we have now achieved an unprecedented level of cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UN remains, of course, a longstanding partner, and we are turning this partnership into reality: in theatres where both are or could be engaged, in Afghanistan, Somalia, Kosovo and Libya, and through our strategic dialogue. I have also personally engaged on security and defence with our strategic partners, not least regarding areas like the Horn of Africa or in Libya. I signed a framework agreement with the United States of America in June on their participation in CSDP civilian missions and already 60 US citizens under EU chain of command are operating in Kosovo and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to foster closer cooperation with other partner countries, including contributors and the neighbours to the south and to the east.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to end my remarks with the possible way forward. I think we have to further operationalise the comprehensive approach, by better linking our conflict prevention, mediation, development and conflict resolution activities. CSDP has a vital role to play in addressing forms of organised crime, such as trafficking of drugs, of weapons and, of course, of people. These are directly linked to conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">For example, the security threats in the Sahel also relate to the influx of weapons and militias as a result of changes in Libya. On this, the combination of all of the European Union’s tools in a coherent strategy is absolutely essential. We have to pay constant attention to force generation and capabilities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council undertook to make every effort to address this challenge and I will examine innovative ways to improve force generation in order to make proposals in the first half of 2012. Force generation, by the way, means getting the right people in the right place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Work on military capabilities should continue towards a systematic pooling and sharing, not only as an answer to financial constraints, but also as means of enhanced operational effectiveness in the long term. We also have to enhance the effectiveness of missions and operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU should act through CSDP missions and operations to add value, on the basis of identified needs, with clear objectives and exit strategies to deliver and sustain results. As long as we can deliver on the existing missions, I am always ready to take forward work on possible new missions – in particular, in regions of such strategic importance to Europe’s security such as the Sahel and Libya.</p>
      <p sl="en">The common security and defence policy can only be as effective and ambitious as we let it be. It relies on collective political will and ambition to act. It also means that the CFSP budget should be able to respond to the financial aspects of force generation. The European Parliament’s support in the last months has been essential on this, and I would like to take this opportunity to express to all of you my gratitude.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to close by thanking you for your support on the work on CSDP, to reconfirm my continued commitment to CSDP as an integral and indispensable part of the European Union’s external action and, as I began, to once again thank Mr Lisek for his report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the pleasant and warm words on the report. I would simply like to say that this report is, of course, the result of joint efforts. It is the fruit not only of my work, but also of the work of many members of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and of the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I cooperated very well. I wish to take this opportunity to thank them all from the floor of this House.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I welcome what Baroness Ashton has said, and I am glad that you, Baroness, the representatives of the Member States and the representatives of the Council all show a strong understanding of the problem, the needs, and of everything that relates to the common security and defence policy at the present time. This policy still represents a major challenge for us. I think that both you, Baroness, and the Council recognise that in the European Parliament, in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, there is strong support for actions to promote joint work, joint activities by the Member States, activities aimed at increasing our efficiency in the field of security and defence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">All of you, I hope, are familiar with the statement by the US Secretary of Defence, Robert Gates, about our capabilities in the field of security and defence. This statement was initially met with much criticism, but that criticism was made only at the outset. Subsequently, it turned out that many European politicians, including many officials at the European institutions stated that alas, the US Secretary of Defence was largely right. We face a great challenge, regarding both reform of the common security and defence policy and, of course, good cooperation between the European Union and NATO. In particular, the European Union should focus on the search for synergies that allow its Member States to optimise their budgets.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The financial crisis, which is currently a major issue for Europe, is a global phenomenon and, of course, it also affects the defence sector. There is a tendency to reduce defence spending in the Member States, which is obviously a concern for us. It is true that maintaining defence spending in times of crisis, when faced with social needs, is not an easy task for those in authority and for politicians, but we believe – and I personally believe – that security and defence must not be ignored even in such a turbulent and difficult period for European finances.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the report, I present several ways to optimise spending, suggesting how the means at our disposal, albeit slightly less than we had available before, could be spent in a better way, more appropriately, more effectively. Of course, what Baroness Ashton said is also true: the idea of ‘pooling and sharing’, connecting and sharing out functions has now become a necessity. This will make cost reductions possible. We must identify the most promising, strategic projects in this area, as soon as we can. They should definitely include strategic transport, logistical support, medical assistance, education, mid-air refuelling, maritime surveillance, protection and measures in cases of emergency arising from the use of chemical, biological and radiological weapons, satellite communications and intelligence. There are many fields where this idea of ‘pooling and sharing’ may be implemented effectively. The role of the European Defence Agency is inestimable in this context. It will determine how we can coordinate defence planning in Europe in the best possible way.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another important issue I have dealt with is technological development. Here, too, we have identified many shortcomings. The report also addresses the question of defence equipment procurement, tenders, and many other issues. All these matters require thought and I am very glad that Baroness Ashton agrees that we should simply get down to work.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I am speaking here about this issue in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. It is very likely that, due to the financial crisis and the associated budget reductions, there will be programme cuts that have a negative effect on the defence industry. The absence of a common policy in this area may further exacerbate the negative impacts on the defence industry. A common arms policy may make sense from an economic perspective, but it may also threaten the sovereignty of individual Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For these reasons, a European defence policy should lead to greater multilateral cooperation, while also taking account of the national characteristics of the defence industry. More specifically, in order to mitigate the impact of the financial crisis on the defence industry, it is necessary to consider greater consolidation of demand through joint research projects or through bundling of demand for shared capabilities. Exporting helps some firms to mitigate the impacts of the financial crisis, including firms that are not competitive internationally. These firms should continue to diversify their portfolios, perhaps into the area of civil security.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Lisek and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence for the good preliminary work that they have done on this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, foreign policy obviously always means taking preventive measures in order to make military intervention unnecessary. That is the starting position for our policy. However, military forces are necessary for peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Where military forces are needed, we must deploy them sensibly and make the best possible use of the instruments available to us.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report rightly makes it clear that we are not using our resources responsibly. When budgets are tight, we must ensure that we exploit synergies and this can only be done at a European level. Therefore, it is right that the report calls for a White Paper which, on the one hand, will define the objectives and interests of the European Union and, on the other, will link them with the means and resources available. In areas such as procurement, research and development, for example, we can achieve much more jointly than if each country were to develop and buy its own cartridges. The question of the European Defence Agency in particular is of crucial importance if we are to make any progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also believe that we can make more use of the multinational organisations of which there is an increasing number within the European Union and that we should evaluate our operational readiness and the legal problems relating to it. I think that joint efforts in this area will also help to protect our soldiers. In the case of Afghanistan, it is clear that each country is going in with different reservations and that there is no sensible cooperation. In addition, there is no possibility of implementing the Berlin Plus agreement with collaboration between NATO and the civil crisis management bodies of the European Union. There is a great deal of work to be done in the interests of our citizens, of people who want to stand up for freedom, and of our soldiers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton, you have rightly said that in order to achieve this, we need collective political will. This will have to develop gradually in some capital cities as a result of the limited budget funding available.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, the report we are debating today, on which I wish to congratulate Mr Lisek, concerns the future of the defence sector in this time of financial crisis and is extremely interesting. As far as we are concerned, there are two basic issues: firstly, we need to ensure that synergies and cooperation are strengthened at European level, in order to prevent resources from being wasted and, secondly, we need to safeguard jobs in the defence sector. The current situation calls for smart coordination, in order to lay the foundations for an internationally competitive industry which can create prospects for new jobs in the defence sector. Unfortunately, the restructuring of the defence industry is inevitable. What we need to ensure is that it is done with as few consequences as possible on employment. In the final analysis, European solidarity, specialisation, interoperability and complementarity are, in our view, the guidelines for a progressive policy in the defence sector and an answer to the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I believe that today’s debate on the Lisek report is significant to the future of the common security and defence policy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to welcome this substantive report which not only examines the subject, but also attempts to offer solutions and which, apart from all this, provides opportunities for achieving a cohesive security and defence policy. To paraphrase Al Gore, we now have the chance to turn this crisis into an opportunity for the defence industry and for the future of our common security and defence policy. However, I cannot but stress that this drastic decline in Member States’ defence budgets may pose a risk to our common security, may maintain the still considerable disparities between the United States and the NATO member countries in the European Union, and may make the EU vulnerable in terms of its reaction capability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the instruments that we already have, by this I mean the European Defence Agency, must be used in a purposeful manner. We must increase its reaction capability and integration ability for this pooling and sharing policy, which is the only solution enabling Europe to have a common capability, not to lose the capability it has, to ensure its interoperability in the common defence system, and to be effective in the missions which it has and which, unfortunately, will probably continue.</p>
      <p sl="ro">To achieve this, I believe that Europe is obliged to develop a common technological and industrial base for itself, use its research capability which some Member States have, and continue to favour solutions promoting honest conduct in public procurement, because one of the factors which have made these budgets vulnerable is the issues arising from corruption in the defence procurement system.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We already have a code of conduct, but we will have to use this code of conduct much more effectively. When we successfully make a procurement, we will do it on the grounds of being an opportunity promoting the interests of Europe’s citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to thank Mr Lisek for his positive report, which represents a genuine attempt, as Mr Brok has said, to make the most of the opportunity offered by the fact that all the national budgets are subject to cuts and that therefore, the current level of wastage in the area of defence procurement simply cannot continue. Mr Lisek is taking up the opportunity of the concept of pooling and sharing. I am pleased that he is attempting, by means of a few small amendments, to increase the pressure on the Member States slightly, but in a very polite way.</p>
      <p sl="de">If that were the main content of the report, my group would be voting in favour of it tomorrow. However, there are also two negative points. On the one hand, an attempt is being made in the light of the shortage of money in the Member States to cannibalise the EU budget for defence spending. This cannot be right. It is not right to finance defence research via the EU budget as part of the Horizon 2020 programme or the Seventh Framework Programme. It is not right to finance the Defence College via the EU, to open up the Structural Funds to the defence industry, or to fund a military Erasmus Programme out of our budget. This is a distraction from the actual task in hand, which is to ensure that we combine efficiency and cost cutting.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, I find it particularly strange that the initiative has been led by Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who are normally very much in favour of competition. This report attempts to undermine completely our achievements in the Defence Package with regard to transparency and competition in the process of tendering for defence equipment by claiming that the intention is to protect jobs. I can only ask you not to give in to this. We are tabling amendments for individual votes on specific paragraphs. This should not be included in this report because it is structurally conservative, promotes inefficiency and wastes money.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Lisek has produced a detailed and well written report. Unfortunately, however, he draws the wrong conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems that the answer to every problem in this House is more Europe. It is all about European integration. Our concern here instead should be more military capability and greater solidarity in NATO. That means serious operational commitment and political will, two elements sadly lacking in so many European countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am afraid that the very real threats and challenges that we face will not be resolved by trying to apply the same procedures to defence as we have seen applied to the euro. The European Union should stop meddling in defence. Its ambition is a dangerous, wasteful distraction. The Libyan crisis should have provided more than enough evidence that CSDP was irrelevant. No one wanted an EU military involvement – neither the United Nations, nor indeed NATO – and the Libyan experience revealed very starkly the potential dangers of the pooling and sharing concept, which seemed so attractive to EU policy makers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Germany even withdrew its crews from NATO surveillance aircraft, the AWACS, operating over Libya. What sort of example is that? Of the 28 countries who agreed NATO operations over Libya, less than half actually participated and fewer than a third were willing to participate in strike missions. How could you expect a country such as the United Kingdom, or indeed France, to rely on someone else to provide a vital military capability on our behalf?</p>
      <p sl="en">This report trots out the Eurocrats’ line, their desperate quest for an invented strategic autonomy of the European Union, when actually we should be ensuring that our armed forces have the capabilities and interoperability to deploy alongside our closest and strongest military ally, which is the United States.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr President, given that you are campaigning so strongly against the concept of pooling and sharing, how do you bring that into line with the fact that NATO has exactly the same concept for rationalising capabilities, but simply under another name?</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, Mr Bütikofer makes my own argument for me. This is indeed all happening in NATO so why is the European Union trying to do things? Why is the European Union trying to replicate NATO? Why is it setting up institutions which merely duplicate those which already exist at NATO? The great merit of NATO, however, is that it is an intergovernmental alliance, and sovereign nations can choose whether or not they participate in particular operations. That is the great difference.</p>
      <p sl="en">And we do not have pooling and sharing; we have common command arrangements when there are NATO operations. There are very limited pooling and sharing capabilities, and I have mentioned one of them and that is the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System). We saw what happened to the AWACS in the Libyan crisis, so we have to be extremely careful about this.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need are solid, reliable allies. When the going gets tough, they have got to turn out, even when it is politically difficult. They have to come up with the fighting capability and they have to be prepared to stick it out. That is what we want to see.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, today’s discussion takes place against the background of the economic and financial crisis which has deprived many people of their livelihood, their rights and their democracy, and against the background of the thousands of people, in particular children, who are dying of hunger throughout the world. If we are to make savings in Europe, then we should cut our defence spending. Defence means defence against territorial attacks, so it is good that we can say: Yes, we can make savings in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, even if I were to accept the prevailing logic and to assume that our defence requirements are at a very high level, it seems to me that the aim here is to reach a higher level of military capability under the guise of pressure on costs and to give the defence industry a better and more reliable source of income. I think that the scenario of a defence capability under threat is being exaggerated.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention here that it is not true that cuts in defence spending will lead to a rise in unemployment. That is simply not the case. However, high levels of defence spending do not only involve huge sums of money which are needed elsewhere. The proposals in Mr Lisek’s report also mean putting democracy at risk, for example, by means of the ATHENA mechanism, which is not subject to democratic controls, or by combining civilian and military capabilities.</p>

A government’s main function is to be responsible for its citizens’ freedom and security. No other function can take priority over this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is nothing less than immoral to cut funding in this most important area while billions are being squandered on futile support packages in the name of a wasteful bailout policy. Cuts in defence appropriations also make Europe’s already minimal role in global policy even less important. With the Arab Spring this year, for example, we have seen that the need for military strength is still relevant today, right on our doorstep.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, at the risk of shocking the more federalist among you, I believe that defence policy is an eminently national policy. It responds to the specific strategic, diplomatic and security needs of each nation. Sharing capabilities is nothing more than a drastic loss of sovereignty, the single market of military equipment a joke, when certain Member States stock up on mainly US equipment, believing their defence is guaranteed by Washington, while Europe is incapable of imposing Community preference in this area as in so many others.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Regarding the EU Member States’ common security challenges, there is nothing that cannot be resolved through intergovernmental cooperation, without any intervention from Brussels. I am sorry, but entrusting these areas to Baroness Ashton would mean recognising that Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poors are legitimate in judging our economic policies; it would mean accepting that ‘Merkozy’ can impose a German Europe on 27 peoples, which is absolutely delusional.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For 30 years and more since the disappearance of the Soviet threat, defence budgets have been the first to be sacrificed on the altar of budgetary restraint, to the point where most of our military tools have become deficient or dilapidated, all in the name of purely financial considerations, with each country waiting for its neighbour or supposed US big brother to make the efforts it is no longer prepared to make itself. However, you are making a mistake. Only by returning to independent and resolute national policies will we be able to individually equip ourselves with the necessary resources, not only to ensure our national interest and security, but also to cooperate in the use of those resources so as to overcome common challenges.</p>

      <p sl="fr">European countries will also be affected by another strategic constraint: the attitude of our US friends and allies, who are no longer willing or able to do everything for us where security is concerned. The Libyan case illustrated this point well.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in this very restrictive context, we must revive the ambition for a common security and defence policy which is strong on operations and capabilities.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of operations, Baroness Ashton, you talk at length – and rightly so – about this famous comprehensive approach that undoubtedly only the European Union has the power to promote in terms of the main international crises. We still need to ensure – and this is your role – that this comprehensive approach does not sacrifice security elements and, where appropriate, military elements. It must be truly comprehensive, without watering down this security aspect. That is the positive message you have given us through the Sahel and Horn of Africa strategies, and I welcome it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In terms of capabilities, we must, of course, welcome the European Defence Agency’s role, even if there are unfortunately still some restrictions on its budget. I would be grateful if you could make your assessment of the European Defence Agency’s efforts known.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When talking about the defence industry, we must also remember that strengthening and supporting our European defence industries – obviously without forgetting to rationalise them – also supports jobs and technologies that extend far beyond the defence sector alone and which are of huge strategic importance to our economies, particularly during times of crisis.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, my country, Greece, owes one-fifth of its debt to the defence industry. As you know, there is Turkey’s casus belli against Greece and we need to be equipped to defend ourselves. Baroness Ashton, we can no longer maintain the defences we had in the past. May I ask you a question? If Turkey acts on its casus belli , as it did recently, who will defend the borders of the European Union? We are talking about a real threat here, for which we need to have proper defences. We would like the Commission to take over this amount and this budget, given that we are talking about a real threat, not about questions of prestige, not about whether the European Union will participate in Afghanistan or elsewhere. There is a real threat to which we cannot respond and you need to consider how we will respond to it as a Union.</p>

Is she saying that of course there are real threats out there and we need to have proper defence? Does she not recognise that the NATO alliance provides that proper defence and that what the European Union is trying to do is of no relevance to this whatsoever? Does she not think that the United States would be trading good reliable allies for an institution that is politically rather awkward and militarily rather incompetent?</p>

When there was a military episode between Greece and Turkey a few years ago, it was not NATO and it was not the European Union that responded and helped; it was the US sixth fleet, and that is a real pity. I trust I have answered your question, Mr Van Orden. I am talking about a real danger, not about all the other things we debate here which, fortunately, are simply questions of prestige.

      <p sl="en">High Representative, I want to focus on a fairly narrow point that you mentioned in your opening remarks. That was on the signing of the framework with the United States on civilian missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan and the number of people who are currently working on these programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all should welcome the expertise that many of these people bring and their bravery in difficult and dangerous circumstances. I think especially of the pioneering role of former members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in Iraq in training the new police force and in working with civilians to ensure the capacity to preserve peace and democracy following the withdrawal of British and American troops in that country. At times, this was both a lonely, dangerous and indeed complex job. It was, however, a job made more difficult and more complicated by European bureaucracy and I would ask for your assurances that the people who now serve in Afghanistan and Kosovo will not be obstructed in the same way by bureaucrats in Brussels.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Lisek for his really excellent report, which highlights all the sensitive issues and the areas where there are deficits and explains how we can achieve more by working together.</p>
      <p sl="de">Baroness Ashton has rightly said that the common security and defence policy can only be as effective as we let it be. She is right about that. I would have liked to have seen the Council conclusions on 1 December allowing it to be more effective, for example, in the area of planning and management capability. We have just about been able to agree that the operations centre in Brussels can be used on an ad hoc basis, but not systematically or permanently, and I find that regrettable. I would also like to know how it can be that there is a commitment to battle groups in the Council conclusions, but that the Member States are unable to put together two battle groups in the first half of 2012. Why is this? How can this be prevented from happening in future?</p>
      <p sl="de">The pooling and sharing initiative has also been mentioned by many speakers. In my opinion, it is excellent and should not just be used as an emergency measure, because our finances are so stretched, but because it will genuinely bring us closer together. However, I would like to know to what extent the Ghent initiative and the pooling and sharing initiative have really resulted in the gaps in our capabilities, which were highlighted in the Defence Industrial Headline Goal 2010, being closed. I would also like to know when we will finally put into practice the permanent structured cooperation, as called for in the letter from the Weimar Triangle plus, in other words the five countries, dated September 2011. What steps is the European External Action Service taking to support the implementation of the permanent structured cooperation?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the current effort to save the euro carries important security and defence implications which need our attention. First, the envisaged rigorous fiscal and budgetary discipline calls for continuing downsizing of our defence budgets while security challenges continue to accumulate, including in our immediate neighbourhood. Even if neither of those challenges is yet a threat, their accumulation, if unattended, might confront us with a dangerous and threatening mix in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, Europe is increasingly forced to sell its assets, and not always to a friendly buyer. Again, if this is not attended to, we might end up with strategic European assets in the wrong hands.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, the effort to save the euro has already undermined the EU’s internal solidarity. With decision making concentrated in the hands of the euro countries, suspicion and even recrimination have crept to the surface, potentially undermining our pooling and sharing effort.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, at a time when the US is diminishing its contribution to NATO and talk about a smaller alliance has already been initiated across the Atlantic, Europe’s credibility – as both global actor and security provider – suffers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, before I come to the topic in question, I would like to mention that our former fellow Member and Vice-President, Mr Lambrinidis, is here in the Chamber. He is holding a conversation at the back and we are pleased to see him. He is not listening, because he does not understand German, but that does not matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">When I attend events in my constituency, I always ask my constituents: Which has more soldiers, the European Union or the United States? People generally give the wrong answer. The Member States of the European Union have 2 million soldiers under arms, while the United States has 1.4 million. We are armed to the teeth, but we are only spending on these soldiers one-third of what the Americans are spending. That is plainly nonsense. For this reason, pooling and sharing makes perfect sense. However, it is also clear that we cannot leave this to the armed forces alone. The process must be under political control. In this respect, this report makes a major contribution to the political debate and I would like to thank Mr Lisek.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I would like to express my criticism of one point and that concerns offsets. The opinion expressed in this report cannot replace the legally binding provisions of the directive on defence procurement in the European Union. I have read the Commission’s guidelines on the use of offsets and it is essential that we follow them. Regardless of whether they are civilian or military, direct or indirect, they always have the effect of distorting competition and, under the terms of Article 346, are only permitted in very few exceptional circumstances. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to emphasise this once again, to stick to it and to vote accordingly.</p>

The first fact is that the European Union was founded as a project for peace, in order to ensure that there were no more military conflicts between the states in the Union. We have completely fulfilled this objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second fact is that all the Member States still have their own national defence and security policies, with all the states agreeing on three points. We have an efficiency problem, a recruitment problem and a financing problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third fact is that it is not possible to have an efficient, credible common foreign policy without a common security and defence policy. This means that we need to do everything we can to establish a common defence and security union based on these three facts. Mr Lisek’s report shows us what we can do on the basis of the existing Treaties to increase efficiency, improve our political credibility and reduce the budgetary requirements, because it is better to do this jointly than to do it individually and inefficiently.</p>

      <p sl="de">Secondly, I am proposing that we take seriously the objective of increasing cooperation which we have set ourselves and follow it up with action.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the financial crisis is having a dangerous impact on our national security and defence capacities and therefore restricting CSDP operationality. We are living in a time when the Chinese, among others, come on buying sprees to reap, at cheap prices, the benefit of sensitive defence and security technology developed by Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="en">As my colleague Krzysztof Lisek’s very good report highlights, pooling and sharing resources and capacities in security and defence is central for the EU and European states to escape irrelevance in global governance, even within NATO, as Secretary Gates complained.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be clear: without assuming a European preference against similar measures by others, we will never build the European industrial base that is needed to ensure our strategic autonomy, as well as preparedness to enter into synergies with others, be it in NATO, the UN or other frameworks</p>
      <p sl="en">Spending shrinking defence and security budgets in a smarter way – as Baroness Ashton said – requires getting rid of the corruption which is pervasive in the offset system, and the opacity dominating security and defence procurement. It also requires two Member States, Britain and France, to be persuaded to cease wasting money on their nuclear arsenals, which do not serve to counter any of the threats Europe and the world are now facing: just the opposite.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to say to Baroness Ashton that Libya was a glaring missed opportunity for a CSDP mission and therefore for EU, and not Franco-British, leadership. Your job is indeed to persuade Member States not to miss these opportunities and to assume these responsibilities. We in this Parliament will definitely support you in these endeavours.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the financial crisis has shown us more clearly than in the past that we have two options available: either to become divided to the point of Europe’s disintegration or to promote strengthened cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As far as this Parliament is concerned, I believe that, in general, the second option is preferable by far, primarily because it offers the only way in which we can play a significant role in a globalised world.</p>
      <p sl="ro">China’s defence budget, which Ms Gomes also mentioned earlier, has grown by almost 200% in the last 10 years. During this time, EU Member States are about to cut all their expenditure in this sector. This is why the only logical solution is better coordination of defence planning and pooling and sharing our capabilities. Our intervention in Libya has clearly shown us why we need to do this. In addition to our involvement in NATO, I believe that the time has come for us to build a real European defence capability.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report which we are voting on suggests specific steps for achieving this objective, and I would like to highlight three of these steps:</p>
      <p sl="ro">1. creating a European Semester for security and defence reviews;</p>
      <p sl="ro">2. strengthening the ‘Security’ section in the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development;</p>

The Member States need to cooperate closely and to coordinate their efforts in order to combat the common threats identified in the European security strategy, by shouldering their share of the responsibility for establishing peace and security, not only in Europe, but in neighbouring countries and the wider world.</p>
      <p sl="el">The economic and financial crisis may constitute a challenge and, at the same time, an opportunity to integrate the defence policies of the European Union, given that they can encourage the Member States to apply necessary and important reforms in the defence and security sector. It is perfectly comprehensible and we support and back the pooling and sharing policy as things stand. However, due to the military occupation of Cyprus and the continuing presence of Turkish troops on the island, the Republic of Cyprus cannot implement the recommendations in the report to the degree that it would like to do, especially in the pooling and sharing sector. Cyprus is forced to continue to focus all its efforts on territorial defence-based action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Lisek, makes one question absolutely clear: that reducing the defence sector in the course of the financial crisis poses a risk to the credibility of Europe as a stabilising force in the world. It is not even the question of reductions in defence expenditure. Even more alarming is the way the money is being used. National defence planning continues to be very uncoordinated, which results in capacity gaps, over-capacities and duplications. Defence research and technology has a totally insufficient share of our spending.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the message of this report is that the financial crisis also provides opportunities. It is time to end the tradition of isolation in national defence planning and I absolutely agree with the High Representative, who said that multinational cooperation pooling and sharing should become a rule rather than the exception in our activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">But I would also like to talk about cyber defence. This is an area which is in need of a decisive breakthrough in established nation-centred models of thinking. More efficient cooperation and qualitatively better coordination are the key requirements, and these are not just good wishes, because the ominous potential of cyber threats is still developing ahead of our preventive and defensive measures. Our task is to build more joint cyber-defence exercises and burden sharing on cyber incident analysis and, of course, we need also in Europe a cyber defence coordinator.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, there can be no doubt that the deep economic crisis is putting a great deal of pressure on national defence budgets and, by extension, on the European defence industry. Everyone, even the Member States facing extensive specific and inelastic national security requirements, such as Greece on its eastern borders, are seeking realistic and effective solutions based on a lower cost/higher performance approach. Under these difficult circumstances, the truth is that there are not many options. Thus, more extensive and fundamental European defence cooperation is a one-way street. However, it is an uphill one-way street.</p>
      <p sl="el">The application of cooperation and synergies is not a simple endeavour, because defence policy forms part of the hard core of the national sovereignty of states. That is why we also need to work with decisiveness and flexibility and why we must support the pooling and sharing approach. At the same time, of course, interoperability, complementarity and, of course, rationalisation of defence spending are particularly important. In Greece, we are trying to achieve this but, believe me, it is very difficult, because we face a real threat. With these thoughts, I wish to congratulate Mr Lisek on his exceptional report.</p>

      <p sl="ga">I think that in the modern world, we have seen greater freedom for people to travel and that also has opened up greater opportunities for terrorists and criminals to engage in their activities. For that reason, I think we should be looking at a broader role for defence forces in particular in counteracting the activities of criminal gangs and terrorists; and often these are interlinked.</p>
      <p sl="ga">If I might give an example: illicit cigarettes being consumed in the European Union cost the European economy around EUR 10 billion a year.

In these times of escalating extremism, populism, xenophobia and terrorism in Europe, a common defence policy by individual states is more necessary than ever. I wish to intercede not only for a common defence policy, but also for joint and coordinated control of the performance of the individual components of defence, in order to prevent abuses of, for example, the defence intelligence service, as occurred recently in Slovakia, where this service abused its powers and listened in to its own citizens.</p>

The very same Members that have been advocating a succession of attacks on the workers and people of Europe, in the name of deficits and debts, from wage cuts to the so-called adjustments aimed at ending public health, education and social security systems as we know them, are here today to claim bluntly that the military capacity of the EU has to be developed, ensuring that the budgetary constraints do not affect military spending. They are even arguing that there is a new driving force behind these expenses, as they did in the Council a year ago.

      <p sl="en">I was in Afghanistan a few weeks ago and saw at first hand the great job the British forces are doing there, protecting civilians, confronting terror and building an infrastructure. It is British taxpayers who are footing the bill for the second largest contingent there, not Germans, Slovakians, Greeks, Luxembourgers, Portuguese, Italians, etc. Baroness Ashton, neither you nor any Member of this Chamber has a right to describe these forces or other Member States’ forces as EU forces. The UK forces owe on oath of allegiance to Her Majesty and her government, not the EU. As already stated by fellow UK colleagues, NATO is already in place and, as seen in Libya, is effective. If you cannot get unanimity on the euro, how on earth can you do so on complicated security issues?</p>
      <p sl="en">One thing I have a real problem with, Baroness Ashton, is your part in this. As a former treasurer of CND, you are talking about security policy with nations that have nuclear weapons. How on earth can you provide an objective view on this?

Defence budgets are too small at the moment, which means that cooperation is the best way to ensure our military capabilities. For instance, simulators can be used in rotation. We can also buy jointly a much larger number of F-16 aircraft.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We already have two examples of the way in which NATO Member States share their capabilities: military transport aircraft, whereby each country pays for a certain number of flights through leasing, and maritime cooperation between France and the UK, with one providing ports and the other ships.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Air Transport Command initiative is a particularly useful example where the use of existing capabilities is optimised by transferring some competences to a common structure.

We had better get used to that. The economic and financial cuts added to this are pushing Europe into a defence ‘trap’ where we will be unable to meet our present and future commitments should we not do something about it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Individual nations are not in an industrial position to work alone. Procurement, technology, new innovation: these approaches need, by their very nature, to be shared, pooled and made available for all.

      <p sl="pl">I am very pleased that a decisive majority of you, ladies and gentlemen, supported the main points of my report. I think we all agree that security should not be neglected. Many journalists or colleagues from this House have asked me who exactly this report is addressed to, who exactly should be considering all the points made. I believe that it is not actually addressed to the High Representative, and I would like to apologise to her for saying this, since Baroness Ashton has supported most of our points. The report is addressed, first and foremost, to the Member States, to the governments and to the parliaments of the EU Member States. Accordingly, if the report is adopted tomorrow, it is with these governments and parliaments of the EU Member States that we should now engage in dialogue on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wanted to respond to my dear friend and colleague Mr Skinner’s point there. I very proudly served for 30 years as a military officer in Her Majesty’s armed forces on operational duties in many parts of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I left the army in order to go into politics, while I was waiting for a seat, I did indeed spend a short time in the European Commission, where I had a very interesting insight into the ways that the Commission worked. This has provided a very good background and experience for what I do now.</p>

    <intervention id="2-428-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Catherine Ashton" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, this has been an interesting – and I think very important – debate, not least because, in the context of looking at the economic situation that Member States and institutions find themselves in, it is absolutely vital that we discuss how best to make sure that we are able to respond to some of the crises and security threats that we are faced with as individual nations, as parliamentarians and as institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not think that anyone in this House will be surprised to know that this forms part of the discussions that I have on a regular basis with Secretary-General Rasmussen and when I take part in NATO meetings, at their request, both in Foreign Minister and Defence Minister formation. It is really vital that we understand what it is we want to try to achieve and how best to go about it. It is worth remembering the kind of missions that our people are currently engaged in and how those missions work effectively with others that are also operating in the field, not least NATO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me remind honourable Members that we have monitoring missions operating in Georgia as a result of the crisis that Georgia faced when Russia behaved as it did in August 2008. We still have people now who are helping to make sure that there is confidence built on the borders and making sure that people are able to go about their business in an ordinary way.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of people have talked about the Horn of Africa and the incredible work that the Atalanta Mission does, made up of different Member States which very willingly bring together their expertise, their ships and their helicopters, led by the British in Northwood – very effectively by Admiral Potts currently serving in command from Northwood – and actually playing a vital role in ensuring that the World Food Programme can deliver food to people who are literally starving, and helping to support countries which are grappling with how to tackle piracy off their coasts, the threat that poses for individuals, the threat of hostage taking and hijacking, and the threat for those who rely on tourism. These are really important issues where the European Union has a contribution to make, not trying to do what NATO does but doing things with NATO.</p>
      <p sl="en">Perhaps the best example to illustrate this is what is happening currently in Kosovo, with EULEX Kosovo providing what is called the second response line: police officers willing to go in to try to stop the kind of violence that we have witnessed recently in the north of Kosovo, working hand in hand with KFOR, with the NATO forces which are there as the third response unit. This is an international operation because the dangers and difficulties of what has happened between Serbia and Kosovo required us all to provide an international response. Member States freely and willingly want to engage together in a way in which they think they can be effective, which is to provide this kind of police support. That is quite different to what NATO is doing in providing its military support.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout all of these operations, we work very closely with NATO. Indeed, when we were involved with NATO in discussing how best we could support what was occurring in Libya, NATO was very conscious of being engaged in a military fashion, yet needing others to think about how to engage military assets, the kind of equipment that you need in order to support humanitarian aid. So all I would say to those who are worried about the overlap is that we work incredibly hard to make sure that does not exist and we respond to the support that NATO needs and the way in which Member States want to take this forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not have to remind anyone that, as you look around at what is happening in countries to which we are close or where we are operating, there are many issues to be concerned about, as I was especially aware when I met the four Ministers from the Sahel over the last few days. They are looking at our comprehensive and strategic approach to how we support them with their concerns about the hunger of their citizens, about terrorism and their worries about arms now moving down from Libya into the Sahel. They need a comprehensive approach to help them do this and that means thinking about how to support them in a security way as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also got to remember that the European Defence Agency is working collaboratively with NATO. Again, improvised explosive devices are a problem that affects not only our servicemen and women from all over the world in Afghanistan, but in many other parts of the world too. If you can provide a joined-up way of actually looking at how you can identify where those explosive devices might be, who might have made them, the kind of signature that is left by those who make bombs of different kinds, if you can do that, you can save lives everywhere. So if this is done by people who can provide the expertise working together, it seems to me an effective use of time, effort and resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with those who say we also need to think about cyber defence and the importance of how we might respond to that. In this regard, we have been approached by the US Deputy Secretary of Defence to work with them because one of the challenges in cyber defence is that it does not stop at Member State borders, but works across them. Many of the industries and businesses who are most challenged by cyber defence are European as regards their outlets, factories and businesses. They often are a combination of different countries’ businesses working together. So it is logical to try to think of things across the European Union when that makes greater sense.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say two things to end with. First of all, I agree with all those who say that most of our work should be preventative, that the mediation, the work we do on conflict prevention and using resources to try to prevent conflicts and prevent problems, is absolutely right. I agree with that wholeheartedly. Again, that is complementary to those engaged in theatre in other ways. I agree with what has also been said about the need to be extremely proud of the servicemen and women who are operating in theatre at the present time. As we move to what, for us, is the Christmas and holiday season, I am very conscious that men and women are serving across the world and, especially, as was mentioned, in Afghanistan. I am extremely proud of the work that they do and I know that Members of this House are too.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a word for Mrs Dodds because she asked me a very specific question about whether we should make sure that those doing lonely, complex jobs in places like Afghanistan actually have the procedures that will help them and that we should get the procedures right. In response to that, can I agree with her and pay tribute to Mr White for the incredible work that he did in Iraq.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, tomorrow, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought will be awarded to representatives from the Arab Spring, from Tunisia to Egypt, from Libya and Syria. Unfortunately, not all of them will be with us tomorrow. Our Syrian friends are still fighting for their rights and therefore cannot be with us here in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, honourable Members, the Arab Spring is a good example of the universality of human rights and of peoples’ aspiration to live in democratic systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">This year’s winners embody the dramatic changes that have defined the past 12 months, and I wish to pay tribute to them now. Whether through dramatic acts of self-sacrifice, endurance in prison, or daily confronting injustice, they remind us of the true meaning of courage. By drawing cartoons or organising online, they remind us that courage manifests itself in many different ways. It is about speaking the truth and refusing to be intimidated.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the case, too, for this year’s Nobel Prize Winner from Yemen, Mrs Karman, whom I had the opportunity to meet with just a few days ago. She deserves all the recognition she is now receiving as a result of her struggle for women’s rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also the case of the group of Afghan women whom I met at the beginning of the International Afghanistan conference in Bonn and who are a real inspiration to us.</p>
      <p sl="en">Speaking out fearlessly is something that has defined the careers of many in this House, and none more so than President Buzek. Under him, Parliament’s work on human rights has significantly increased and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him for his dedication.</p>
      <p sl="en">2011 has been a particularly active year for human rights in Parliament. The Subcommittee on Human Rights, chaired first by Heidi Hautala, and now by Barbara Lochbihler, has developed a great number of activities, including the De Keyser report on democracy, which inspired me, in particular, on the idea of the global and coherent approach to human rights and to democratisation and civic participation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The historic developments in our neighbourhood have significantly advanced human rights. The bringing down of longstanding repressive regimes has led to the formation of new governments and to free and fair elections. The continuing violent crackdowns in Syria, repression in Belarus, and protracted conflicts, including in the Middle East, require us to keep up the pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The events of this year have served to highlight the vital links between human rights and democracy. It has led to a new approach for the European Union, which aims to provide greater support to partners engaged in building what I have termed ‘deep democracy’.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is where the right to vote is accompanied by effective freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of religion or belief, underpinned by impartial justice, public security from accountable protection forces, and access to a competent and non-corrupt civil service.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also continued using our financial instruments to promote and protect human rights. In 2011, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights funded more than 1 200 operations in more than 130 countries. Even in the toughest environments, where basic rights and freedoms are the most repressed, we have been able to provide assistance to civil society. To give just a few examples: our funding has been used to fight media and cyber censorship to keep information flowing out of Syria or North Korea; in Uzbekistan, Belarus and Egypt, it provided legal defence for hundreds of political opponents arbitrarily imprisoned. It also supported their families and their lawyers, who risked imprisonment for taking up their case. It supported the rehabilitation victims, those having undergone torture in Zimbabwe or Sri Lanka, and those affected by the campaigns of mass rape in East Congo or Libya. And it supported democratic transition in Morocco, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Burma Myanmar and Libya, also helping in the support and observation of elections in Niger, Peru and Zambia.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also kept up its work to advance human rights on the multilateral stage in 2011. The UN Special Session on Libya, which made the historic recommendations to suspend Libya from the Human Rights Council, was a turning point in allowing this to respond to emergencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several times this year, the EU raised the human rights situation in Syria, in the HRC and in the General Assembly, building an alliance of countries from all regions, including the Arab world. Our role was instrumental in establishing the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the human rights situation in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">In June, we secured the adoption of a Human Rights Council resolution on the human rights situation in Belarus, with whom we have tried to engage to improve its human rights record.</p>
      <p sl="en">I continue to highlight the human rights situations in North Korea and in Burma Myanmar, reflecting the developments on the ground. I expect the new civilian government in Burma Myanmar will push ahead with political reforms and re-engage with the international community. I hope Aung San Suu Kyi will finally be able to come to this Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize that she was awarded 21 years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">We continue our efforts to build consensus on freedom of religion or belief. I have also maintained my focus on promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people through the implementation of the EU’s toolbox.</p>
      <p sl="en">Promoting and protecting the universal rights of freedom of religion, belief and sexual orientation are central to the EU’s approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also begun work on the campaign on forced marriages, which destroy the lives of so many young people, girls and boys. When I was engaged in taking legislation through on forced marriages in the country I know best and come from, I was surprised to learn that 15% of those who ring the helplines on forced marriages are boys. Either young boys forced into marriage with a girl they have never met, or young gay men forced into marriage for what reasons I do not know.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Brussels, we have been working to put in place the arrangements foreseen by the Treaty of Lisbon to put human rights firmly at the centre of our policy. We are committed not only to guarantee but also to promote their universal respect by all.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Charter of Fundamental Rights has contributed to promoting consistency between the EU’s internal and external policies, and the EU accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be a cornerstone for future developments.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the creation of the EEAS, we have begun to work more closely with Parliament, with Member States and with civil society. The department created within the EEAS on human rights and democracy is currently being reviewed to make it more effective. We have established a network of focal points in all EU delegations that contribute to delivering our EU human-rights policy goals.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Lochbihler gave us the privilege of meeting with all Heads of EU delegations recently, at the beginning of this month, and I hope that the honourable Member was able to see that human rights are at the core of the activities of the people on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each of our Member States have played their own part in bringing their national legislation in line with EU standards of full compliance with all the relevant Treaties and conventions on human rights in the wider UN framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the indivisibility and universality of human rights is increasingly being challenged globally. We will continue to counter this. The ongoing economic crisis should not be used as a pretext for those who want to dilute certain rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">All that I have just said has helped me to inform the review of the EU human rights policy that was first announced before this House and I am pleased that my contribution will be tabled very shortly. I want to outline some main points from that now.</p>
      <p sl="en">The text I will table this week is a contribution to an ongoing debate. It is necessarily concise, meaning that not every detail is reflected, but I hope that it offers a good basis for future work with this Parliament and with the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of MEPs have been involved in the process from the beginning, as when the Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights attended the EU NGO forum in July, which produced a first set of recommendations for inclusion. Since then, there have been various informal meetings and contacts with Parliament, including, of course, with the Human Rights Subcommittee, which contributed greatly to the process, and I want to thank particularly Richard Howitt for the work that he has done.</p>
      <p sl="en">Though much of the discussion about the review of our policy has centred on the process, I also want to say something about the substance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Crucially, I want the outcome of the review to deliver a strong reaffirmation of what the EU stands for: the universality of human rights as binding international commitments and norms. The message must go out that human rights are not negotiable and are inviolable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against that backdrop, I have identified four main priority areas for action.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, overhauling the EU’s delivery mechanisms. I want to make our policy more effective, adapting it better to the specific circumstances of each country, coupled with a global campaign-based approach. A key element here is the strengthening of relations with civil society, so that NGOs are better engaged as full partners with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, achieving a joined-up approach in our policies. This is the idea I have spoken of often, to break down traditional silos, and have human rights running as a silver thread throughout a truly integrated range of external policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, building strong partnerships encompassing the whole world: multilaterally working through the UN and the ICC; regionally developing work, for example with the Arab League; and bilaterally through our dialogues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, speaking as one, which does not mean with a single voice but rather a coordinated and consistent message from everyone, ensuring that the invaluable work of Parliament and the Member States is brought together for the benefit of the whole.</p>
      <p sl="en">I propose to use thematic campaigns to deliver on specific cross-cutting themes. This has already been done to great effect in support of the ICC and the abolition of the death penalty. I believe that approach can be extended, for example, to promote the rights of women, by setting realistic, time limited, achievable, objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am keen to make the best possible use of tailor-made country strategies on human rights, which should be driven by recommendations made locally. Whilst they should stand firm on the universality of human rights and the global standards that apply to all, I believe this will allow us to deliver more across the board than a one-size-fits-all approach for 150 countries. It should allow us, too, to make the most effective use of the assorted tools we have, while engaging with due respect with the views of our partners on the ground. EU delegations are well placed to take this forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to work closely, too, with all my Commission colleagues, to bring human rights fully into the key Community policies, such as development and trade, building on recent communications on the future of development, budget support, corporate social responsibility and the neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with Ms Lochbihler when she says that Parliament has a key role to monitor, assess and provide political accountability for the EU’s actions in the human rights field.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our financial support for human rights must go beyond the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and should be reflected in other EU financial instruments. I will work to ensure that human rights are taken into account consistently in the programming of all EU external financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that in order to be credible when we raise human rights concerns with others, we have to make sure that our own house is in order too. So I am determined to instil a human rights culture in the EU’s emerging diplomatic structures. We already have an active EU training policy, but there is much more to be done in this direction and we are ready to take that forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">And I am very open-minded on the idea of appointing an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, to act as a catalyst and to raise our profile internationally.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to discussing these proposals with Members of this House over the coming weeks and months and to getting their views as we take this issue further forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">This Parliament, this House of democratically elected representatives from all over the European Union, is a champion of human rights, in the European Union and in the world. Your reports and your opinions inspire us and help to guide the work that we do. It is for this reason that being in front of you today on this topic is not merely my obligation, but it is also my privilege.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your statement. It has to be admitted that we have been waiting for it for several months already. This delay has critically deferred the adoption of the respective reports by the European Parliament, and it has also delayed the report on human rights by Mr Howitt, to which you referred.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Your statement has highlighted a wide range of problems, but I fail to see there what is mentioned in the title of the statement, namely, ‘raising effectiveness’. Nor can we see either how to resolve these problems or the specific mechanism, which we could also gladly work on in our further cooperation. The priority mentioned in the statement – the reform of the judiciary – is extremely important in my view, yet here as well, a need exists for effectiveness in our activities, because although we have been talking about such blatant cases as those of Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky in Russia for several years … – Ms Ashton, I should really like you perhaps to listen to what we are saying too. Ms Ashton, we would like you to listen to us a little bit – … we have not moved in this direction by a hair’s breadth.</p>
      <p sl="lv">Human rights have a very important role in the world. We have experienced ‘the Arab Spring’, and democratic elections are crucial in this respect. I should like to see these rights to be more strongly stated in the case of Russia, too. I should like you to express a stronger joint EU stance in response to the calls for help that 80 000 people are addressing to us, so that we should have no double standards; so that we respond to election violations in Russia as we do to violations in Kyrgyzstan, where I had the honour to lead the mission, in Belarus and in Ukraine. Double standards do no honour to our human rights policy. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is my first parliamentary speech since last week’s events and I regret having to use the first sentence to say to you, my parliamentary colleagues, that the actions of the government of my country do not represent the views of my party or many of the people who I represent, and those actions do not represent me.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Socialist and Democrats’ human rights spokesperson, can I welcome, however, the strategic review of human rights presented today by Baroness Ashton – long awaited. I absolutely endorse the aspiration to raise effectiveness, to achieve concrete results, to emphasise civil society, to better implement the recommendations of election observation missions, to continue the priority given to the defence of human rights defenders, to support the proposals for thematic campaigns and to move to a Brussels-based Council working group.</p>
      <p sl="en">We agree with the High Representative emphasising a bottom-up approach, but may I tell her that in the last year, I have asked EU delegations in two critical countries – I will not name them – who is their focal point on human rights and where is their human rights country strategy? I met silence in response. We know we have a long way to go. We agree with her that worldwide, there is an attempt at erosion of international human rights and international humanitarian law, which is why I welcome her statement today towards considering the appointment of a special representative, perhaps specifically on international justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">Just as we have failed states, let us be honest and say that the EU human rights dialogues and human rights clauses are close to being failed mechanisms – not to be abolished but requiring life-saving surgery. Meanwhile, bolstering our external advocacy, by strengthening internal respect for human rights, requires a mechanism, not just an aspiration. The mainstreaming of human rights – a development in particular trade policies – has yet to really begin, not just compatibility in the language of the communication, but coordination for common ends, using all our external relations instruments at one and the same time. I believe the benchmarks she identifies are the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, as has been said, in the annual report this year, I have been asked to provide an input to the review and I am pleased to do so. There will always be the need for some confidential communication on human rights abuses. But just as those who perpetrate war crimes or crimes against humanity must always be held to account, we who seek to uphold human rights must be held to account too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is some good material in this strategy paper. I fully support one principal theme, and that is the importance of coherence. This is necessary not only across the range of external policies, but also in the form of consistency with our internal record.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU cannot argue against torture and disappearance in the war on terror as effectively as is necessary when it has failed to fully clean house on our own collusion in secret prisons and rendition flights.</p>
      <p sl="de">Our credibility in the desperately necessary battle for equality on the basis of sexual orientation is undermined by the shabby prejudice still suffered by LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people in some EU states. Our voice will not be heard sufficiently in condemning ethnic, racial and religious discrimination abroad when Roma, Muslims and even Jews are not guaranteed proper freedoms and security at home.</p>
      <p sl="de">One procedural reform in the Council might help, and that is to have joint meetings of the Working Party on Human Rights and the Working Party on Fundamental Rights, Citizens’ Rights and Free Movement of Persons: COHOM and FREMP, to use our beloved acronyms. These are committees looking at human rights violations outside and inside the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is, however, disappointing that the European Parliament only merits seven lines in a 20-page document. Ironically, those lines say that the European Parliament has made human rights and democracy one of its highest priorities. Well, not quite high enough to give us a central place, apparently, in an EU human rights strategy. This could probably have been written in the 1970s, taking absolutely no account of our enhanced role under the Lisbon Treaty. There is quite a long way to go before we have a fully coherent and fully credible human rights strategy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the communication on the human rights review which was adopted on Monday. This is all about increasing the focus on human rights and democratisation in EU foreign policy. It is a very important step forward and we welcome it. We need to take a serious and in-depth look at what we can do and I would like to quote a remark that you made, Baroness Ashton, yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs which summed up the situation very well: ‘How to do human rights better’. The European Parliament has already called for this on several occasions and we in Parliament are happy to respond to the request to submit our own proposals. We have already made our initial comments. However, it is clear today that some areas definitely need improvement and further development. For example, there must be a mandatory process for calling to account companies which have their headquarters in the EU and which promote or encourage breaches of human rights. We have seen a worrying rise in the number of authoritarian regimes imposing censorship measures on the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second point that I have noted down is that you did not take up the proposal to create a high-level representative or another position within the EU in order to enable human rights issues to be represented across a number of different policy areas. I would like to thank you very much for your verbal support for this. We in Parliament are very pleased about this, as it is something that we have called for.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to mention that it is very encouraging that the Danish Minister for European Affairs stated here today that implementing and developing this human rights strategy is very important for him. I will take this as an opportunity to emphasise once again that we will perhaps succeed in ensuring that all EU institutions not only adopt one strategy, but also commit to a common declaration and come to a common consensus on human rights. You will have the support of the human rights campaigners here in the House on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to thank Baroness Ashton for her well-prepared statement, but I find it hard to disagree with Ms Ludford when she says that we do not discuss the issue of human rights sufficiently within the European Union itself. Unfortunately, this issue is linked to specific problems, in particular, in the case of indigenous national minorities that have inhabited certain territories for centuries. This applies not only to the Roma minority but also to other minorities. Regrettably, the current government in Lithuania does not respect the rights of indigenous national minorities. National minorities there do not have the right to use their own surnames, which is their rightful entitlement. They are also punished for using their mother tongue when dealing with public authorities, even in places where they account for over 80% of the population. Property rights regarding land seized by the Soviets are also not respected either. We ought to discuss all these matters. It is good that the High Commissioner of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has recently paid a visit to Lithuania. I do think, however, that both the Commission and the Council should also pay serious attention to these matters.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in June 2010, Baroness Ashton, you announced your ambition to implement a new EU strategy in favour of human rights and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Here we are 18 months later. The Arab Spring, as it has become known, will have further strengthened your ambition. You have paid tribute to those involved in the Arab Spring and to their courage – point noted. As you say in the statement we have just received at last, the European Union has not always acted in the most efficient and coordinated manner possible. The European Union has had little to do with the democratic advances you are congratulating yourself on.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You claim to be inspired by the European Parliament’s work with regard to human rights. I should like to believe you, but I have my doubts. I will give you two examples of them. On page 19 of your statement, you devote a paragraph to the European Parliament, eight lines in fact. You shower us with advice asking us to intensify our efforts beyond the Subcommittee on Human Rights. I admit that this paragraph perplexes me, and I would gladly advise you to reread all of the European Parliament’s resolutions on these issues and to better integrate them into your strategy in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second example: the democracy and human rights clauses. What you say on pages 12 and 13 of the statement again leaves me frustrated. Yes, there have been similar clauses in the European Union’s framework agreements with third countries since 1995. Yes, these clauses should, as you say, be taken into account within the framework of free trade negotiations. Yet we have seen no progress on this matter in your statement, and I am sorry about that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to finish with something: I should not like it, Baroness Ashton, if we were more demanding with regard to new democracies that we do not …</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, throughout the world, obstacles, including legislative obstacles, are increasing against freedom of worship. The number of attacks and murders grow each year and affect practitioners of all religions, but Christians in particular.</p>
      <p sl="it">Paradoxically, religious freedom is becoming an increasingly uncertain issue rather than one of the most natural and indisputable freedoms. In Europe and in our Parliament, we constantly proclaim our defence of human rights, but our work to guarantee religious freedoms is still rather ineffective.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I am in favour of the proposal, which has been put forward on other occasions, to commission a specific, accurate and yearly report by Parliament to monitor the state of religious freedoms around the world. This report would provide the necessary facts to plan appropriate and preventive political action in line with what was expressed by the High Representative to organise policies which are country-specific in terms of the needs of the country itself.</p>

      <p sl="en">One of the reasons you gave, Baroness Ashton, was to speak with some Heads of State there. Could you tell us, did you speak to some African Heads of State, maybe Ugandan Heads of State, about homosexuality and its criminalisation there? Hillary Clinton has said that the US is going to give it its utmost priority. I just wondered, did you use that opportunity? And, by the way, how much taxpayers’ money did it cost to go there and why were you at the Commonwealth meeting which has nothing to do with the EU?</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, I just recently visited Gaza and Ramallah. When I asked about the treatment of lesbian women, the corrective rape, police beatings, etc., they looked at me with disgust as if it was something I should not have asked them or that it was not the EU’s business. Bearing in mind the absolute fortune, the millions of taxpayers’ money from the EU that goes into Gaza, some of which probably gets to Hamas, etc., what are you actively doing to stop these corrective rapes of lesbian women in Gaza?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, with the upcoming review of the strategy on EU human rights and democracy, we have a rare opportunity to demonstrate leadership in the enhancement of human rights implementation through foreign policy. It will be very important to get this strategy right, as it will shape policies for a longer period of time. That is why the EU should opt for a really ambitious approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">This will require the preparedness of structures inside the EU, especially the External Action Service. We need to make sure that we have prepared instruments and well-trained staff. It was encouraging to hear from the High Representative that she intends to appoint an EU special representative for human rights who would act as an EU voice in human rights policy internationally and increase coherence of EU policy in this field.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU human rights strategy needs to ensure the full involvement and commitment of all EU institutions. Therefore, it should be effectively mainstreamed into EU policies and mechanisms, including those such as development, energy, environment and trade. All in all, it is necessary to ensure that the EU, through its foreign policy instrument, its enlargement processes and as an international actor, plays a clearly strengthened role in shaping human rights and democratisation in the whole world.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, it is true, perhaps, that we have waited a long time for your statement, but you have laid the groundwork before this, and you have had the time to put it to the test. I can honestly say that you have been a champion of human rights. I should like to lend my support to all of your work in this field, even though this statement has arrived a little late.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have said many interesting things. I should perhaps like to raise a small point: I do not believe that enough emphasis is placed on the importance that all our agreements can have – whether it be the aid we give to certain countries, or our partnership agreements, or the trade agreements we are drawing up with countries – in conveying the very idea of democracy and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, I should like to emphasise how much I welcomed the statement including ‘more for more’ for democracy in the Mediterranean, which to some extent determined our aid for advances in relation to democracy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to tell you that, in my opinion, there is still a lot of work to be done with regard to trade agreements. For example, if I take the free trade agreement we are currently discussing with Colombia, I know that, through the negotiations, we have already been able to help Colombia make progress in relation to trade unionists’ rights and human rights in general. However, although we are finalising this agreement, we have still not fully developed the monitoring mechanism which will enable us to see if the country is continuing to move towards democracy. There are still things to be done on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is that I do not agree with everything that has been said, at times, in the broad criticisms addressed to you, but I should also like to tell you that, in spite of it all, the issue of double standards, which we have not always known how to manage, is still of great concern to me. I should therefore like us to work hard on this, by trying to adopt a consistent approach in this regard.</p>

The people of Russia were calling for the annulment of the rigged elections of 4 December. The ALDE Group expresses its solidarity with the people of Russia in their legitimate call for human rights and civil liberties to be respected, and for free and fair elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights are universal everywhere; therefore, the EU must avoid a differentiated approach to different countries. We must be consistent in our statements and policies.

I am thinking, in particular, of the relationship between trade and human rights. Moreover, it is now time we translated words into deeds and I would, once again, like to ask that you devote some attention to religious freedom.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Last week I visited both Egypt and Turkey, or eastern Turkey, to be precise, two countries where the European Union rightly wants to have a strong presence, but which are failing to move in the right direction. In Egypt, I talked to the Copts, whose lives are becoming more difficult, particularly now that there is a threat of extremist parties coming to power. In Turkey, I saw that the model which President Erdoğan and Arab countries are so keen to promote strongly disadvantages Christians. Aramaic Christians are slowly being brought to their knees and centuries-old monasteries, such as Mor Gabriel, are at risk of losing all their land.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in June 2010, here in the European Parliament, the High Representative announced her intention to launch a consultation to form a new human rights strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Madam High Representative, you said that this new strategy must be ambitious and should make the strongest EU statement so far on human rights in terms of purpose, EU policy and EU commitment. While the main objective of the communication you are presenting today is to open a discussion with the other European institutions on how to make the EU’s external policy on human rights and democracy more active, more coherent and more effective, our expectation is that there will now be a swift, transparent and inclusive process moving forward and a truly ambitious EU human rights strategy will be adopted without delay.</p>
      <p sl="en">I strongly recommend that a strategy should state clearly that human rights are not merely principles, nor European values, but international legal standards and obligations undertaken by states within the framework of international law. I expect the EU to make strong references to cooperation with the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and various international justice mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that a strategy should ensure that the European Parliament and civil society organisations are stakeholders in overseeing implementation of the EU’s human rights policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the High Representative’s initiative of launching an interinstitutional debate to ensure that an effective and comprehensive strategy for promoting human rights and democracy is at the core of the EU’s external policy. However, I agree with my colleague, Sarah Ludford, who says that the EU is not going to be seen as credible as a human rights promoter if it continues ducking the serious responsibilities of Member States that collaborated in human rights violations under the guise of the war on terror.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that a country-by-country strategy on human rights that takes into account specificities and priorities along with dramatic campaigns, such as women’s rights, and related governance and rule-of-law questions, such as the fight against corruption, should enable EU foreign policy to improve coherence and achieve concrete results. Benchmarking can be a useful tool for us to reward a genuine willingness to protect human rights and dramatic practices and, through our trade and development policies, to put those who continue to resort to repressive policies at a disadvantage. Take Ethiopia, the second most populous country in Africa, which is massively financed by EU aid and is an outrageous example of our inconsistency, where we turn our blind eye to the blatant human rights’ violations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe Parliament and civil society must participate in the elaboration of such country-based strategies and in the monitoring of their implementation. High Representative, in your visits, you should make a point of always meeting human rights’ defenders, particularly of women’s rights, and ensure that human rights are a mandatory topic for EU delegations and all in the European External Action Service. I also welcome your idea of appointing special representatives on human rights, international justice and international humanitarian law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, like others, I welcome the rather tardy arrival of this communication, but nevertheless it is welcome in itself. It represents not, I think, what the Vice-President/High Representative defines as the beginning of a process, so much as the end of the examination of the subject from the point of view of the EEAS, Parliament, the Commission and the Council. When Parliament finally produces its report – I hope very soon – I think that will end it, because we all know that human rights are a universal value, that the document itself defines democracy as a universal value.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I think is important is to accept the propositions made in the paper and to think about the new institutional balance we need to strike on this. Yes, this year has been a challenge for all of us, but when – and I welcome this – the Vice-President/High Representative says she is open to the creation of a special representative for human rights, I hope she means that she is prepared to do this, because I know that the NGOs, the European Parliament and the human rights community generally want to see that expression of the commitment of the Commission and the EEAS to human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need also a European endowment for democracy as another institutional element in the development of this process of democracy and human rights in the world.</p>

Ten years on, we are now reviewing the Union’s policies in respect to the support of human rights. At the same time, I would like to say that for myself and for all Polish people, today is also an important day, as it marks the 30th anniversary of the imposition of martial law in Poland. Solidarity was banned on this day 30 years ago, but survived as a popular movement and received enormous support, including material support, from Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Many of the points presented here have already been approved by Parliament in the adopted report prepared by Véronique De Keyser. We would very much like the idea that was supported in Véronique De Keyser’s report, namely, the idea of establishing the European endowment for democracy, to be mentioned in this communication. I have not found any reference to this idea in the communication that has been presented, but at the same time, I know that you, Baroness Ashton, together with the Polish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Radosław Sikorski, have promoted this instrument very effectively among all ministers for foreign affairs of the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This Endowment is expected by our partners in the fight for democracy and human rights. The letter, which was addressed both to you, Baroness Ashton, and to the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, has been signed by many world authorities on human rights, including Aung San Suu Kyi, Lech Wałęsa and Václav Havel. I think that the efforts deployed in establishing the European endowment for democracy and the role that it will play may assist in achieving the more effective approach referenced in the title of the communication on which the debate between Parliament, the Council and the European Commission has just commenced today.</p>

I would also like to remind everyone of the Yemeni woman who spoke in Oslo’s City Hall. Those of us who heard it will not forget her speech, either.</p>

Then there is something that has been mentioned previously and that I would like to emphasise and that is how absurd it is that we are so silent on what is happening in Russia. I am sure that opinions are divided in this regard, but it seems to me that we are being silent on this.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This is the fact that an election in Mr Putin’s Russia should need to be guarded by 50 000 police officers, or maybe it was soldiers, and that the authorities are throwing hundreds of opponents into prison. Mr Putin ought to take a step back. He really has not made as much progress as he should have done when it comes to respect for human rights and freedoms.

For instance, in all of the comments that have been made, there has not been a single mention of the thousands and thousands of mass graves that have been discovered in the area of Kashmir, only as recently as a matter of months ago and going back over the last year or so.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank honourable Members for what has been a very important and very interesting debate, both covering specific issues and the general thrust of what we are trying to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wanted to apologise to Ms Vaidere, but she is not here. I was distracted because we got the news of the death of four people and 46 injured in Liège in Belgium, which has been unfortunately due to what looks like explosions. It flashed on my phone and I must confess that I was very shocked and had to look at it, but I do apologise for not listening for that moment.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like – because I did not do it earlier – to say thank you to Ms Andrikienė for the work that she did in 2010 on the human rights report. It was an extremely important and valuable document. I skipped over her name – and I do apologise for that – in the earlier part.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to make it clear that this is not meant to be the definitive strategy. The reason for that is simply that I want the European Parliament to be involved and engaged with me as we drive this forward. You can never have a definitive moment in human rights where you say that we have actually got everything written down and everything covered, because situations change. As I have tried to argue in my contribution to it – and, yes, it did take time because I was not satisfied with some of the ideas and I wanted to push further and try out things and discuss and involve people as much as I possibly could within the service – we should look at how we can make it more effective and how we can take the relationships we have across the world and make sure that we use them to further the opportunities for democracy, peace, security and human rights for people across the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I hope honourable Members will see it for what it is and what it is not. I do not pretend that it is a document seeking to give you all the answers, but rather to put down some thoughts that I hope will inspire further debate. Colleagues have raised a number of specific issues and I am just going to comment on two or three of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the issue of freedom of religion and belief. We have done a huge amount of work this year and it is an issue that honourable Members have raised on a number of occasions and which, indeed, Member States have raised in the Foreign Affairs Council. I am very pleased that we were able to achieve the consensus on our UN resolution promoting freedom of religion and belief. It is so significant that we take this forward. You will know that I have said it must be part of the reporting that we now carry out as part of our gathering together of information on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate what Mr Howitt said about not all delegations being up to speed. I know that. We are at the beginning of building a service and trying to make sure that every delegation all over the world has the resources, the people, the training and the way of going about things. It is not yet complete. They would be the first to say that, and I would echo that. What I hope you appreciate is the commitment to try to get there, not just from me, but also from all the heads of delegation when I met with them most recently.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issues that concern lesbian, gay, transsexual and bisexual people are really issues of core importance to how we support people across the world. As honourable Members know, I have a long and personal commitment on this issue, and I think it is core to what we do. I raise it with individual countries when I visit, and we also make many statements and promote the importance of this issue in everything that we do.</p>
      <p sl="en">For reference on the Commonwealth – I am afraid that Ms Sinclaire did not wait for the answer either – I was a special guest of the Commonwealth, which meant that while I was in Australia, I had the opportunity to address 53 ministers, to have 28 bilateral meetings and to take part in two events, particularly with NGOs, on forced marriage and women as agents of change. On the way back, I also visited China and Japan, especially to show our solidarity for the people of Japan, still suffering from the effects of the tsunami.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms De Keyser raised particularly the issues of other Commission pieces of work, especially trade. Again, I have tried to capture that a bit in my thoughts about how to bring together our human rights work right across the Commission, so that in trade, in development – in everything that we do – it is part of the approach that we take, so I agree with you. Again, I pay tribute to the work that you have done on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Camp Ashraf, Mr Stevenson, you have been tireless in pushing on this issue. I would say three or four things to you. Firstly, we just have to be a little careful about what we say might happen. Secondly, we are working very closely with the UN on this. The UN is in the lead. I have pushed through my discussions with the Secretary-General and the Special Representative. I have met with the Iraqi Foreign Minister on several occasions, and I have sent a special envoy to do a lot of work, not least with Member States. As you rightly recognise, it is important that those Member States who have nationals as residents in Camp Ashraf also need to be aware of what needs to happen. You will know, most recently, that I have indeed offered support to the UN in every possible way, in terms of how we can make sure that people are properly monitored and can feel secure.</p>
      <p sl="en">But what we must be careful about is telling them that things may go wrong. What is important is to put it in place, so that they can feel confident in the UN process properly looking after them. It is a real challenge for us, but that is what we have to do. I think you know that I have worked extremely hard to try to make sure that the EU properly supports this international and UN process. I hope that this will see effect, as the UN now moves forward to try to support people into the future that they want to see for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Karim, I will not answer on Kashmir now, but I understand exactly what you were saying and perhaps we can talk about that. Thank you for your comments about responding to your letters. I do try to respond to letters from Members of the European Parliament as quickly as I can in all cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, Mr Belder, you raised Iran. You know that we have done a lot of work with Iran on human rights; we have sanctions against them for that. You know, too, that I watch with great interest and try very hard in my discussions with the Iranians to persuade them to move away from the death penalty. In any country it is wrong. In every country, we try to make sure that we oppose it as effectively as we possibly can. On any individual case that honourable Members wish to raise with me, we will do our very best to let you know what we are doing. We follow all these cases where we possibly can – as many as we know about – both on the ground and within Brussels, and we try our very best, not least with our partners across the world, to make sure that people’s rights are respected.</p>

We are in mourning and are completely shocked by this attack, which was carried out by a known criminal. As you mentioned, it has caused four deaths and injured more than 50 people and took place in the city centre, at the height of the festive season when everyone was doing their Christmas shopping. It is a real tragedy and it was very kind of you to have mentioned it. We are truly in mourning this evening.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The year 2011 will go down in history as the year of change in the Arab world. Initiated in 2010 and completed this year, the changes in North Africa highlighted that regimes which seemed immovable can collapse under pressure from people in the streets and the international community, disgusted by human rights violations. From this point of view, the review of the developments in the Arab region and the message they send for the future are encouraging. This also applies to progress in combating impunity, as in the case of the extradition of the former President of Côte d’Ivoire, Laurent Gbagbo, who is to be tried by the International Criminal Court. This allows us to hope that international mobilisation can help punish those who have been accustomed to trampling brutally on human lives and the fundamental rights of their fellow human beings.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In this context, I wish to express my appreciation for the involvement of the European External Action Service in defending human rights. The European Union is the most concerned global player in this area. At the same time, this stance obliges us to step up our efforts to protect those persecuted by dictatorial governments and traumatised by barbaric violence, especially involving human rights activists. In this respect, I believe that a major role must be given again in 2012 to cooperation between the EU and the UN High Commission for Human Rights.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Two aspects of the debate on human rights which are of particular importance are equality and social exclusion. Human rights and equality: the idea of equality before the law is the legacy of the French Revolution. Nowadays, it is considered a basic human right. Despite the fact that there exists legislation which guarantees equality between men and women, its implementation within the European Union is ineffective. In the European Union, gender equality exists on paper only. In practice, women suffer discrimination socially, economically and politically. Discrimination also affects sexual, ethnic, religious and racial minority groups and those with disabilities, as well as the poor and the elderly. The perception that there is a lack of equal opportunities and discrimination is being felt more widely throughout Europe. To all intents and purposes, the only group which is not discriminated against consists of young, healthy and affluent males. In Poland, the additional criterion of being Catholic must also be met.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Human rights and exclusion: second-generation human rights include economic, social and cultural rights. They guarantee so-called social security. Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s objectives include combating social exclusion and discrimination. The question arises as to whether these rights constitute a guarantee against exclusion in the EU. The problem of exclusion concerns 79 million people, which means that the basic rights of 16% of Europeans are being permanently violated. In 2010, the European Union assigned EUR 26 million to fight poverty and social exclusion. What are the results of these actions? Is the Union capable of dealing with such enduring infringements of human rights?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, may I, through Ms De Keyser, send my condolences to those who have lost loved ones or who have been injured in this terrible event in Liège.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about the EU-Russia Summit which, as honourable Members know, will take place in Brussels beginning tomorrow evening. Let me first say a few words by way of opening on the elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">As honourable Members know, parliamentary elections to the State Duma were held on 4 December. When we discussed in July in this House the preparations for those elections, I expressed then some concerns, especially regarding restrictions to political pluralism. Following up on those observations today, the prior exclusion of various opposition parties has been confirmed as a key flaw of those elections. In addition, we have seen reports about procedural violations such as a lack of media impartiality and the lack of clear separation between political party and state.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have also expressed concern at the detention of protesters demonstrating for free and fair elections, and reports of police violence against activists, journalists and mere observers. In contrast, the large demonstrations over the weekend in Russia were peaceful and the authorities, in my view, generally handled them very well.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the instructions by President Medvedev for all accusations of irregularities to be properly investigated. The electoral legislation that exists in Russia provides for appeal and rectification, and we expect of course that this legislation will be respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The evidence needs to be looked at, and OSCE/ODIHR and other organisations will issue their final reports in due course. Their findings must be addressed by the authorities in order to allow for smooth and fair presidential elections in March.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should also recognise that the Russian people have made full use of existing possibilities to express their dissatisfaction with some aspects of the political situation. To many commentators’ minds, voters expressed their views on issues such as corruption, the lack of political freedoms and their economic situation by voting for other parties, bringing down the registered result for the leading United Russia party from 64% in 2007 to less than 50% now. Thus, the citizens have passed a clear message, and it certainly has not gone unnoticed. Both President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin have acknowledged receipt. The future development of democratic institutions in Russia, as I said in July, should depend on the Russian people and their choices.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU though is not a bystander. We have close links from the economy to family ties and our common history. When acting together, as strategic partners, the EU and Russia can have a decisive influence on key challenges and conflict situations around the globe. We have also taken joint commitments to develop democratic institutions and human rights in the UN, the Council of Europe and the OSCE frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will, of course, be raising our concerns about the elections at the upcoming EU-Russia Summit tomorrow. For us, modernisation means both Russia’s full integration into the international rules-based system and the development of citizens’ rights and freedoms and I am pleased to report that this approach of constructive engagement does work. The summit may actually produce a number of results.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me mention Russia’s WTO accession first, which should be officially decided in Geneva on Friday. As Russia’s largest trading partner by far, the EU was a crucial partner in the 18-year-long negotiations. As former Trade Commissioner, I had my own personal experience in this process. WTO accession will be a historic moment which will open a new chapter in our bilateral relations. It will bind Russia to international trading rules, open new opportunities for trade and investment and protect our companies from arbitrary decisions. WTO accession should also give new momentum to negotiations on the new EU-Russia Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">On visas and mobility, the Presidents will be approving a list of common steps towards visa-free travel, full implementation of which should lead to the opening of visa waiver negotiations. This process implies a significant modernisation in areas like migration policy and border management, but also guarantees for the respect of fundamental rights. Improved mobility and people-to-people contacts will bring our people closer together and facilitate the exchange of experience and values, cultural cooperation and business.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, the Partnership for Modernisation is under full implementation, with new projects being prepared. At the summit, we will re-emphasise our conviction that modernisation is not only about technology. Rule of law, protection of citizens’ rights, civil society engagement, and a level playing field for companies are all crucial elements of successful modernisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me finish with a few words on foreign policy. Russia is a major partner for the EU. Sergei Lavrov and I meet regularly and try to build common approaches to the most pressing international issues. Generally we succeed, but in some cases our positions differ. The obvious example at the moment is Syria, which will no doubt be under discussion at the summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to advance on protracted conflicts. On Transnistria, we have managed to restart formal 5+2 talks. Progress on substance now needs to follow. We will continue to engage in order to support the mediation efforts over Nagorno-Karabakh by the Minsk Group, in which Russia is a member. As I mentioned earlier, I visited the South Caucasus last month and we are concerned about the lack of progress in these talks, as tension is very clear throughout the region. And we will continue to engage Russia over Georgia, where Russia still needs to fully implement the commitments it made in the August and September 2008 agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude. As you see, we have a broad agenda with Russia, which reflects the way in which our economies, our societies and our strategic concerns are increasingly intertwined. As we remove barriers to trade, travel and exchange, the outlook and expectations of our citizens can be expected more and more to converge and the fundamental interest of cooperation will increase.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our ambition is for EU relations with Russia to be the engine for this modernisation process, which we have always maintained must be both economic and political.</p>

    <intervention id="2-465-000" speaker_id="28424" name="Tunne Kelam" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this is a very important moment just now before the EU-Russia Summit, because there has been a sweeping change of attitudes and moods among the Russian population.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the most significant change that has happened is in the minds and attitudes of the Russian people, who have lost their indifference towards politics, who are taking an active part in monitoring elections and protesting against the rigging of the same.</p>
      <p sl="en">And the second thing we have to take note of is that Mr Putin’s party has become a minority party. At a meeting last week with Russian opposition leaders, together with Mr Kasparov, in Brussels, it became very clear that even this figure of 49% is not trustworthy and that the real result might be much lower, about 30%.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now there is a question for the EU and we must consider our opportunities: what to do, how to change and how to help restore democracy in Russia? I think that business as usual will not do it. As the Russian author, Lilia Shevtsova has said, Russian style thus far has been to pretend that they do have democracy and the style of European leaders has been to pretend that we believe this. This time has now passed and we have to react in a similar way to how we reacted to the Arab Spring. There might be a Russian Spring also and we need to take this into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="en">So I would ask the High Representative to convey to our Russian counterparts the message that we take democracy seriously, we take the intentions of Russian voters and the Russian population seriously, and that their leaders have to change their style. This includes also putting restrictions upon officials who are guilty in the Magnitsky case and also of rigging elections.</p>

    <intervention id="2-466-000" speaker_id="2295" name="Hannes Swoboda" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think we have an important summit before us in two aspects. First of all, in the dialogue we have to have with the leadership in Russia and the energy dialogue and, of course, the conclusion of WTO entry. We have the visa liberalisation and we have the partnership and cooperation agreement on which we should work. I hope we can have a real restart on the issue. Of course, we have also the election question, as you just mentioned and thank you very much for your very clear position, High Representative.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a sign of the maturity of the Russian population and of their unwillingness, as my colleague said, to accept everything coming from the Kremlin or the White House – the Russian White House, I mean – and I think we should support all civil society that is trying to convince the political establishment that another way is much better: an open way, a democratic way. I think this is the line we should follow. As we now have in our joint resolution, and as you said, High Representative, we call on the commission that was set up by Mr Medvedev to look into the matter seriously, openly and frankly. I was, together with Mr Fleckenstein, in Russia at the beginning of November. We saw already at that time that there would be serious flaws in the election, and we hope that a good result comes out of this research and inquiry. I would suggest, and have suggested, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, together with the delegation, holding a hearing in the European Parliament in January with representatives of all the parties – of the parties who could run, with the parties who were prevented from running, with civil society, with the OSCE, in order to have a real open picture.</p>
      <p sl="en">With this in mind, I will reject now an appeal in our joint resolution about the parliament’s re-election to be repeated. Let us wait and look into the detail, let us look into the facts. Maybe we will come to a result; maybe even the Medvedev commission will come to a result that in some areas it should be repeated. I think we should have a clear position and have real facts on the table before we come to these conclusions.</p>

    <intervention id="2-467-000" speaker_id="97230" name="Kristiina Ojuland" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, the primary issue with regard to EU-Russia relations at present is the legitimacy of the Russian State Duma elections. Taking into account the preliminary conclusions of international and local monitoring organisations, the legitimacy of the newly elected State Duma is at best questionable. By extensive ballot stuffing, vote rigging and not allowing several opposition parties to register, the people of Russia were not granted their constitutional right to choose their representatives in free and fair elections and frankly, like many Russian people, I personally do not believe President Medvedev’s promises to check up the results of the last elections.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although Russia is, and will remain, an important partner to the EU, our economic interests may not overshadow the principles of democracy that the European Union stands for. Thus, the EU should thoroughly review how to proceed with a partner that lacks the necessary mandate to represent its citizens. Yeltsin’s Russia is in the past and now we are dealing with Putin’s authoritarian state.</p>
      <p sl="de">The idealistic approach that we can prevent the Kremlin from turning Russia into an authoritarian state by working as peers in different organisations has obviously failed. The harsh truth is that with Putin and his cronies in the Kremlin, it is unlikely that the long-term objectives or the values of the EU and Russia could be conciliated.</p>
      <p sl="de">First, I would call on the High Representative to insist that all the peaceful demonstrators who were arrested by the Russian authorities are released. Second, the Russian authorities must be reminded of their international obligations stemming, in particular, from Russia’s membership of the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Russia must hold new elections – free and fair elections.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the EU-Russia Summit takes place this week against the background of an extremely tense and crucial situation. The purpose and success of our modernisation partnership will depend on whether the Russian state is prepared to enter into a similar modernisation partnership with its own people and to restructure Russian society by introducing more democracy, the rule of law and respect for civil rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The preliminary report from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the results of monitoring by the Russian NGO Golos show that the elections to the Duma were heavily manipulated and falsified in favour of the ruling United Russia party. As far as we can tell, United Russia did not have an absolute majority. Ten thousand people protested against this because they feel that they have been betrayed and that their dignity has been violated. They do not want a revolution. They want fair elections and real opposition parties. Even Mikhail Gorbachev, who until now has been restrained in his criticism of Mr Putin, is calling for these elections to be annulled and new ones to be held.</p>
      <p sl="de">We should support this democratic movement and not just stand by and wait to see whether it manages to ensure that its demands are met by its own efforts. The courage and the lack of fear shown by these people point towards a new era. However, it is crazy to expect independent investigations to be carried out by the people responsible for the election fraud. What do we expect from President Medvedev? He was Vice-President under Mr Putin for four years, he intends to investigate the accusations, while already knowing that this will come to nothing, and he will do nothing to deal with those responsible for the election fraud, but instead threatens those governors who have not come up with the required figures.</p>
      <p sl="de">The results from the Caucasus alone are completely unbelievable. On the other hand, Mr Medvedev still has the opportunity to make up for all the disappointed hopes following his announcement of reform by at least showing that he is a real president before his departure and arranging new elections. What do we expect from Mr Putin? He has dug out the old cock-and-bull KGB story about the USA managing the protests. He is a dyed-in-the-wool dictator who has been ignoring civil society’s calls for democracy for years. In Russia’s sovereign democracy, it is not a sovereign that is needed, because Mr Putin makes all the decisions. Therefore, the EU should not, as it usually does, obediently call for clarification and investigations on the Russian side on Thursday. Only new, fair and transparent elections and the inclusion of the parties that were previously excluded will reduce the discontent of the Russian people and enable the conflict to be overcome. Therefore, I am asking you to support our amendment tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, first of all, I would like to thank the High Representative for prompting Russia to fulfil its self-imposed obligations relating to Georgia, namely, to honour the six-point plan, known as Sarkozy’s plan. I would like to thank her for this and I would ask for due attention to be paid to this issue over the course of the summit.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would, however, like to draw the High Representative’s attention to the following issue. We have a political consensus in this House with regard to our opposition to the undemocratic character of the most recent elections and the need to provide assistance in stimulating the emergence of a civil society in Russia. This was expressed in the statements given by Mr Kelam from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), by Mr Swoboda, by Ms Ojuland and Mr Schulz. I would like to ask the Commissioner to note this. The European Conservatives and Reformists Group is naturally also very determined on this matter. The opinion of ECR is that this awakening of a civil society requires our support, and is a prerequisite to Russia becoming an important economic and political partner of the EU, which is what we want it to be. I would like to encourage the High Representative to focus on this matter. It is evident that she will have the support of the whole House on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, a strategic partnership must involve a balance of interests on key issues, including people’s living conditions, business relationships based on equal opportunities and the joint challenges that we have to resolve. ‘Strategic’ means giving priority to our common interests as part of this balance. It also means making concrete achievements, ensuring that the political decision-making processes are transparent for everyone, and explaining the electoral procedures.</p>
      <p sl="de">We agree on the fact that nothing can happen without joint security. However, it is difficult to understand why joint security is not being established jointly. The proposals for discussion have been put on the table, including by the EU. The next summit must deal with these proposals. It must come to a binding agreement that the money used to buy more weapons would be better spent on the specific processes for establishing the modernisation partnership. This is in the interest of both sides and also in the interest of our citizens, who want to have their fair share of the economic progress.</p>
      <p sl="de">A prospering economy and a fair society will ultimately make obsolete the arrogant behaviour which comes with power. A society of this kind needs the competence and commitment of all its citizens. The Russian demonstrators made this clear to their government in Bolotnaya Square on Saturday and called for concrete change.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the flu alert issued by Russia’s Chief Sanitary Inspector, Gennady Onishchenko, on Saturday, 10 December made no difference. In spite of it, tens of thousands of people across the country took to the streets in protest against blatant electoral fraud during the 4 December elections. In the face of Mr Onishchenko’s thinly-veiled political manoeuvre, the protesters demanded that medication be administered to a corrupt social and political establishment, and rightly so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I sincerely hope, Baroness Ashton, that in its upcoming discussions with the Russian authorities, and especially in the lead-up to the presidential elections of March 2012, the EU will show support for the Russians who have voiced such necessary criticism. Baroness Ashton, in addition to this domestic matter, I would also like you, in your talks with the leadership in Moscow, to bring up another very urgent issue: one which relates to Russia’s foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When it comes to the nuclear dispute with Iran, how do you rate the chances of Russia adopting a more positive, that is, a more cooperative, attitude towards Western efforts to settle this inflammable conflict peacefully? I would expect Iran’s nuclear dossier to be high on your priority list for the negotiations with the currently so beleaguered Putin/Medvedev leadership duo.</p>

    <intervention id="2-472-000" speaker_id="1122" name="Ria Oomen-Ruijten" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, this summit will be about relations between the EU and Russia, pure and simple. That is what the agenda says. It will really be about the ways in which the EU and Russia can strengthen each other. May I say that, in this respect, this summit could turn out to be a positive one? Russia will become a member of the WTO and that, therefore, means that we now have an opportunity to kick the Partnership Agreement into a higher gear again. That is something which is sorely needed. Energy, visa liberalisation, mutual investment in business, but also reciprocal conditions and an end to discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One thing which is part and parcel of any partnership is values – and that means genuine values. You said that, Baroness Ashton. By ‘values’, we mean democracy and civil rights. However, Russia showed a lack of respect for these things in the recent elections to the Duma. In some regions, more than 100% of the votes were cast for a single party. That means that they have now become worse at adding up than they were in the times of the communism of yore.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As one person put it, this government has no respect for maths. However, it is of the utmost importance that, in the coming presidential elections, we prevent a repeat of this same drama and of the same lack of respect for the values of free elections and that we reach a clear agreement on that with President Medvedev.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On that score, we therefore need to give Russia a piece of our mind. A country which purports to set so much store by peace and values will also have to once again ensure compliance with one of those fundamental values: democracy, the right to vote and be voted for.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, I can only endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said about the elections. We very much want to make it clear to the Russian President that his announcements must be followed by actions and that we will take him exactly at his word. I think that what Mr Swoboda has said is right. We should hold a major hearing for everyone involved, once the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has submitted its report. Therefore, I think it is wrong to call for new elections now, before the report is available.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would just like to say one thing to Mr Kelam, but unfortunately he is no longer here. Perhaps it is simply an error in the interpreting. He said that the demonstrators in Moscow represent an opportunity for us. I do not believe that this is right. It is not an opportunity for us, but an opportunity for the people of Russia. We need to be careful about what we say.</p>
      <p sl="de">Elections will be an important topic of conversation at the summit, but this can also be a summit which gives confidence. There are two positive points which I would like to mention briefly. One is accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after 18 years of negotiations. This not only clarifies the rules, but could also make a new agreement with us easier, hopefully in future prevent the unilateral trade restrictions that there have been in the past, and alleviate the repeated pressure caused by the Siberian overflight rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second and final point that I want to touch on briefly is the question of visas and free movement. We are pleased that a regulation will be put in place on the border traffic to and from Kaliningrad. That will really make the situation easier for people in Poland and in Kaliningrad in particular. The joint steps which the two countries aim to agree on and which have been carefully prepared will hopefully, with good will on both sides, lead to a regulation on visa-free travel at some point. We will be discussing modernisation, human rights and the development of a civil society and we want to achieve sensible, positive results. However, without personal contacts, none of this will succeed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Baroness Ashton, the fact is that Mr Putin is not just a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of democracy; he is also a top-class opponent. We must not forget that he won his first election and came to power by starting a campaign to exterminate the Chechens. During his entire period of office as president and prime minister, he did nothing else in both his domestic and foreign policy but reverse the partial democratisation of Russia that had already been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Medvedev put a friendlier face on the whole thing, but the Bible says: ‘By their fruits shall ye know them’. Unfortunately, we have not seen any fruits of this kind. Therefore, I believe that the call for democratic elections in Russia is a justified one. It makes no sense at all for us to ask the people who manipulated the elections to investigate and uncover their own manipulation. That simply will not happen. People are constantly saying: ‘Yes, but stability in Russia takes priority’. This is what was said in North Africa and it was followed by crocodile tears over Mr Mubarak, Colonel Gaddafi and others. We are interested in stability in Russia, but this can only come about when Russia is a democratic state under the rule of law, as embodied by the civil rights campaigners and opposition groups in the gallery and by the Russian demonstrators for freedom. There can be no stability without freedom. That is a lesson from history which we must finally learn.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to draw Baroness Ashton’s attention to two issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, sometimes we tend to use any opportunity to give general assessments on all aspects of life in Russia, which is not always helpful because that makes us less focused. This time, it is fully understandable that we use this opportunity to give our assessment of and recommendations concerning the problem with the elections in Russia. We hope that the presidential election next year will be better prepared, better managed and more fair and free.</p>
      <p sl="en">Along with the criticism we should, however, recognise that, despite the expected win of the ruling party, Russia is different today, and we have to use the momentum not just to blame the authorities, but also to encourage them to change their approach next March. At the same time, those who fight for more democracy in Russia should feel our backing as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I would like to call Russia to join the EU in its efforts to help the common neighbourhood. Both sides are interested in the stability, sustainable economic development and social progress of these countries. In this respect, we should encourage Russia, particularly the new leadership that will be elected next year, not to compete with the EU for influence, but to contribute to the resolution of frozen conflicts, especially in Nagorno-Karabakh in Transnistria.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, first of all, I would like to welcome the former Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, who is sitting here in the gallery listening to our debates. There are a few items not included in the resolution we will vote on this week. Firstly, the Medvedev-Putin tandem and their party United Russia lost the State Duma elections. They not only lost around 80 seats in the State Duma, but de facto lost the elections. Blatant violations, which were an integral part of the election campaign and which were evident and recorded by international observers and independent Russian observers on polling day, and vote rigging bear witness to the fact that the elections in Russia were neither free nor fair. Many Russians were denied the constitutional right to vote and stand in the elections. Secondly, the people of Russia have taken to its streets and city squares in protest. As we have already heard today, Mikhail Gorbachev, the first and last President of the Soviet Union, is calling for fresh elections to be organised. I believe that more notice should be taken of this. Finally, Madam High Representative, tomorrow you will talk to our Russian partners ….</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, as an election observer, I already expressed in Moscow that the political competition had not been fair and that the parties had not been on an equal footing, especially as regards the flawed law on voting rights, the party law, and free access to the media. At the same time, I would warn my fellow Members that it would be out of proportion to demand repeated elections. This is not the way to deal with Russia; we should instead firmly caution Russian political actors to organise the presidential elections in a fair and straightforward manner. I fully agree with those who spoke before me with respect to the United Russia Party having suffered serious losses and having lost a constitutional majority.</p>
      <p sl="hu">With the leading government party no longer holding a constitutional majority, Russian democracy has taken a step forward. Not only does the party have a strong opposition in parliament, but the riots in the streets also show that Russia is not satisfied with the results of modernisation.</p>

      <p sl="sl">In the past, we had a broad dialogue with people like Mr Kasyanov and with other representatives of the Russian opposition, but I think we can also confess to having neglected this recently.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the conduct of the recent parliamentary elections in Russia has clearly shown that there is deterioration in Russian democracy. Reports are widespread of electoral fraud, harassment and arbitrary detention of peaceful demonstrators by the authorities and with impunity for the election fraudsters, which all flies in the face of Prime Minister Putin’s assurances that the elections were free and fair.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is somewhat unbelievable that no new political parties, including the main opposition party, the People’s Freedom Party or PARNAS, were allowed to register for participating in these elections.</p>
      <p sl="en">Russia must be reminded that, as a member of the OSCE and the Council of Europe, it is legally obliged to safeguard the integrity of the electoral process. Russia must also put an end to widespread corruption and massive self-enrichment at the highest levels of the state and government, as is illustrated by the tragic case of Sergei Magnitsky, who chose to expose the most egregious tax fraud and was, as a result, tortured to death in prison.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, although tens of thousands of unhappy Russians have sent out a clear signal, hardly anyone is under the illusion that the protest movement has enough force to cause a stir throughout the entire system, or even to instigate a change of power. Quite apart from the fact that the political convictions of the demonstrators are widely divergent, Mr Putin enjoys popularity as a stabilising force after the chaos of the 1990s that should not be underestimated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Stability in Russia is also greatly valued by Europe’s business community. In the final analysis, Russia cannot always be measured by the same democratic standards as apply in Europe. Democracy is still in its infancy and it will doubtless take some time before the psychological and moral legacy of 70 years of Communist dictatorship is finally eradicated.</p>
      <p sl="de">No doubt Mr Putin will try to prevent further protest by making carefully limited concessions. Nonetheless, this does offer potential for democratic development. The European Union ought to take advantage of this at the next summit.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I had to leave the Chamber temporarily at the end of the last debate to answer a constituent call, yet Baroness Ashton had a little bit of a dig at me. Baroness Ashton, I am sorry that you consider it so important that Members actually have to be in the Chamber to listen to you, but you are not very popular here, are you? There are 23 Members here, less than 4%. You really should not upset me, as otherwise you would probably lose me as a regular attendee.</p>
      <p sl="en">But that does not diminish what I actually want to say about Russia, which is a rather serious situation. But does it not really show the limitations? I could characterise Russia as a big angry bear that we are trying to teach some manners to. The elections were a disgrace. They should be re-run, as they do not come up to any level of democratic accountability, but then what does the EU know about that? I believe that the Russians call the EU a temporary phenomenon; well hopefully, they are right about that. Is it not the reality that there is absolutely nothing you can do? We can talk with them, but they will do whatever they want. It just shows the limitations of your position.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, can I thank everyone who has participated in this debate and say that the messages that have been given, very loudly and clearly, will indeed be passed through, not just from myself but, of course, in the meeting with the Presidents. We will be raising the elections, that is very clear, and I want to say first of all to Mr Kelam that we are following the Magnitsky case very closely. It is indeed, as he described it, very troubling.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also think it is important to let honourable Members know that we will be meeting with the EU-Russia Civil Society Forum on Thursday as well and that will give us an opportunity to discuss with them recent events and more generally the relationship between us, and we always discuss the international obligations that we have when we meet at the summit.</p>
      <p sl="en">My staff have met with former Prime Minister Kasyanov, who is here again, and of course I met him in July and recognise that he is here with us this evening.</p>
      <p sl="en">In all our discussions with Russia, there are a number of issues that continue to be raised of which, of course, Georgia is clearly one, and in our foreign policy discussions, the particular points that honourable Members have made are indeed part of that.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Iran, yes, Mr Belder, you are right to raise the fact that this for me is a big and major issue and a great deal of my time is taken up with working to see how we can move forward on this. Russia is part of the E3+3 and works very collaboratively with us, with me, in order to try and find ways in which we can persuade Iran to turn away from the issue of acquiring nuclear weapons, which I think all honourable Members are very concerned about.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk too about the common neighbourhood, as Mr Vigenin called it, we discuss the issues of Transnistria and of Nagorno-Karabakh and, as I have indicated earlier in this debate, it is very important that we see some progress there. I was quite concerned when I was in both Azerbaijan and Armenia at how tense the situation is. Russia could play a part in helping to reduce that and through the Minsk Group to find a solution to it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the points that have been raised about ensuring that we show that we take democracy seriously and expect Russia to as well are very important. As for Ms Sinclaire, I meant no offence at all. I merely turned round and said, ‘I am sorry she is not in the Chamber’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Last week, the European Parliament voted through the report concerning the extension of the visa-free travel area between the Kaliningrad enclave and Poland. I hope that this will pave the way for the Kaliningrad region to further open up to Europe. However, complete demilitarisation of the enclave has to be an essential precondition. For we should remember that this territory is still being used by Russia as a means of exerting military pressure on the European Union and NATO. In recent weeks, the Kremlin released information regarding the deployment of Iskander missiles in the region. Since December 2010, Russia has also been developing radar systems responsible for the positioning and trajectory control of ballistic missiles. The missiles located in the area pose a significant threat to the safety of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, while their importance as part of the strategic protection of Russia, as argued by the Russians, is negligible. Therefore, the issue regarding the demilitarisation of the Kaliningrad region should unquestionably become one of the discussion topics at the forthcoming summit. It is also important to raise the problem of free passage for shipping through the Pilawska Strait and the attempts by the Russian side to restrict the right of innocent passage, which applies to this category of straits.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The following item is also extraordinarily important and extremely urgent.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">It is a statement by the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Syria (2011/2880(RSP)).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as you indicated, this is an extremely serious issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, since we discussed the situation in Syria last October, the brutal repression has continued. The situation is dramatic and particularly worrying in Homs. As honourable Members will have seen, the UN reports the number of victims has reached 5 000 people – and this may well be a conservative estimate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation is totally unacceptable. The brutal repression of civilians has to stop. Assad must listen to his people, his neighbours, to the Arab partners, to Europe and to the world. We all have the same message: he should stop the violence to his own people. He should let that transition get under way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thousands remain in detention. The recent report of the UN International Commission of Inquiry indicates that crimes against humanity were committed by the security forces. Some people in Syria are taking up arms to defend themselves and the risk of widespread armed confrontation is increasing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this complex and difficult background, we have ratcheted up our sanctions and we have done whatever we can to build a growing international consensus to isolate the regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have been in regular contact with the Arab League Secretary-General, al-Araby and hosted him at the latest Foreign Affairs Council. The Arab League has our full support in their demands on the Syrian regime, including the immediate cessation of violence, withdrawal of military from cities, and the granting of humanitarian and media access.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also backed their plan to dispatch an observer mission to protect civilians, offering our assistance, and have welcomed their decision to impose sanctions. Regional leadership is key and should continue. The role of Turkey, with which I have been in regular contact, and its decision to impose sanctions is also crucial as we seek to weaken the regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have worked hard on the international scene, stepping up contacts with key international partners to isolate further the regime and its supporters. I have discussed this with Secretary Clinton in Washington, with Prime Minister Lavrov in Moscow, with the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and with Foreign Minister Davutoglu when I met him in Bonn while he was visiting there.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the UN, successful efforts by the EU and Member States led to a resolution in the Third Committee of the General Assembly. A Special Session of the Geneva Human Rights Council was called at my initiative and a new resolution was adopted with unprecedented support in early December, establishing a Special Rapporteur for human rights in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now all members of the UN Security Council must assume their responsibilities in relation to the situation in Syria. The EU and its Member States will continue to lead the efforts for a strong and united message.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Syrian opposition has grown more active and is better organised, certainly over the last few months. Like honourable Members, I have met this morning with a Syrian Human Rights activist and I know the role that this Parliament has played in engaging with those activists and encouraging them and their work. I have met with other leaders of the Syrian National Council and welcomed the ongoing efforts by the Syrian opposition to try and establish a united platform and to work for a shared vision for the future of Syria and the transition to a democratic system.</p>
      <p sl="en">We all agree on the importance of a strong and inclusive opposition political platform taking in all religious and ethnic communities. It is essential that the Syrian opposition maintains and develops its clear commitment to a peaceful and non-sectarian approach. The coordination with opposition on the ground to set out plans for the transition is of the utmost importance.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the sanctions track, our strong response to the Syrian regime’s policy of repression has been further reinforced. Further individuals and entities linked to the regime have been added to the assets freeze and travel ban: now, 86 individuals and 30 entities are on the list. At the beginning of this month, new measures were adopted to strengthen and complement the existing sanctions. In the oil sector, we have added a ban on the export of key technologies and equipment. In the financial sector, we have expanded the prohibitions on contacts with Syrian banks and we have also established a ban on the export of monitoring software and equipment in the telecommunications sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">But despite the efforts of everyone, the Syrian regime has remained defiant. None of the opportunities offered by the Arab League have yet been accepted. We think that they need to comply fully with the Arab Plan of Action. But they want to find excuses and dilute the effectiveness of an observer mission but the Arab League, I am pleased to say, remains strong in their position.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude with a word on the humanitarian situation. I believe it is increasingly worrying. Conditions are worsening in the places most badly hit by the violent repression and armed confrontation. These include electricity cuts, water supplies, shortage of basic commodities in the areas most affected such as Baba Amr, a quarter in Homs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Most recently, a systematic denial of access has made it impossible to independently assess the situation. We are particularly concerned about the consistent reports of abuse related to the harassment of medical personnel and difficulties for wounded victims to safely access emergency health care.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to assume that the information provided is correct, in the absence of free and unimpeded access for aid agencies to independently assess and respond to the most urgent needs.</p>
      <p sl="en">DG ECHO (European Community Humanitarian Office) is closely monitoring the situation from Damascus and was able to carry out a field mission in October. The ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) continues to negotiate access to detainees.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made it clear that we are ready to provide emergency assistance should humanitarian needs be confirmed. We are also recognising the vulnerability of Syrian refugees hosted by neighbouring countries, particularly Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and we are ready to support these refugees if the host countries request our help. We have made that knowledge available to them.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I call on the Syrian authorities to allow this humanitarian access without restriction and across the country, so that Syrians who are in need can receive immediate assistance. I hope that we will see action in the Security Council and that all members will take their responsibilities, respond to this and respond to what the UN Commissioner for Human Rights has said, with a great sense of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as Baroness Ashton has said, the situation in Syria is getting worse by the day, with an extremely high toll in terms of human life.</p>
      <p sl="es">You mentioned the figures released by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: more than 4 000 people, of whom 1 000 are members of the security forces, and this augurs a bloody civil war in the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">Statements of condemnation have come from all sides – the United States, the European Council, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union. However, Baroness Ashton, I believe that the time has come to move from words to action, because condemnation alone will not bring a halt to this situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the economic side, what can we do? You got it right, Baroness Ashton: implement the economic sanctions we have introduced, stop Syrian oil imports to the European Union and support the decisions of the Arab League and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="es">On the political front, we should firstly support the deployment of ground forces requested by the Arab League. Secondly, we should strengthen relations with the Syrian National Council. I would also like to ask your opinion, Baroness Ashton, on the French initiative to create a humanitarian corridor protected by international troops. Lastly, we should obtain a more solid resolution from the United Nations, overcoming the reticence of some permanent members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, whose position is absolutely unjustifiable, continuing in the vein of Resolutions 1970 and 1973, which, in the case of Libya, made it possible to put an end to a government’s criminal violence against its own people.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, what I have to say is, in fact, very similar to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You and we have done a great deal – imposed sanctions, established contacts with the Arab League, with this and that organisation – yet, given the 5 000 deaths that we have now had in Syria and, above all, such a bleak outlook there, I think we actually need to keep in mind a number of scenarios.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The fact is, all the scenarios that I read about are potentially jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire, whether this be slowly repressing the regime which is not going to relinquish power of its own accord, or a violent clash offering arms, for instance, to the Syrian free army, which could lead to greater repression. Whichever scenario we consider, they are all relatively bleak.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We expect you to come up with a scenario that is a little more constructive and to say: this is what can be done, these are the risks, this is what we intend to do. There is the humanitarian aspect, which you highlighted, but which is not a scenario in itself; it is merely offering a lifeline to those now fighting for their freedom.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to tell you some wonderful stories about this side of things – but I do not have the time here – stories which we have been told by Syrian women about how they are coping, how they are involved in mediation, how they care for the victims, set up hospitals in their homes, establish funds to support the families of victims who are in prison, who have been tortured or who have disappeared. Internal opposition is therefore increasing and it is to them that aid should be delivered.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, firstly, we need to come up with a scenario and, secondly, step up humanitarian aid, but for pity’s sake, we need to take action and at least do something.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as we speak, the Syrian city of Homs is being surrounded by no less than 400 tanks. We have seen this movie before. However, in Hama in 1982, there were no cameras acting as eye witness to the world. Now we know what is happening. Al-Assad has killed and tortured to death 5 000 citizens including children; tens of thousands are imprisoned and, instead of al-Assad meeting the ultimatums of the international community, specifically the Arab League, he has given his own citizens an ultimatum to give up members of the opposition, which remains largely peaceful.</p>
      <p sl="de">Al-Assad orders to shoot and kill and has confirmed in his interview last week that he, as Head of Government and commander-in-chief, takes no responsibility at all for what is happening in his country. He has lost his dignity and his legitimacy and I believe that the EU must do everything to prevent the massacre from going on any further. The impunity must end.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have to act more credibly and forcefully by imposing additional targeted sanctions, specifically on the families supporting this murderous regime and keeping it in power, and by implementing the Council conclusions on Syria of 1 December in which the EU decided to stop the export of technologies used to monitor the Internet, to breach and track people’s communications and information flows and to take them out of their homes based on the signals from their cell phone.</p>
      <p sl="de">The information war that is going on is real. And as was the case with oil sanctions, the statement in relation to the digital arms trade – which we have fought to stop for years – has been made. However, we still have to await its implementation, and this is hurting our credibility.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking of credibility, I think it is disturbing that Cyprus blocked Turkey’s participation in the Foreign Affairs Council on Syria. What will you do to ensure that this does not happen again and that we can work with this vital partner, Turkey, on establishing humanitarian corridors and in collaborating through Turkey with NATO as well? The Syrians need the EU and Turkey to cooperate and I urge you to work on this credibility issue, which is very important.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to stress the last point raised by Ms Schaake, because, indeed, not only is it a disgrace, it is also utterly ludicrous, that the European Union and its Council have not come up with the political means to invite Turkey to the table to discuss the situation in Syria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is now clear that the future scenario called for by Ms De Keyser can only come about through dialogue between Turkey, in particular, the Arab League and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is true that there is no written script, but, nevertheless, we do have some assurances. Firstly, Bashar al-Assad will fall. He will fall. That is the deeply-held belief that we all share and, at best, he will be handed over to the International Criminal Court. He will therefore fall.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What this tells us is that civil society has an incredible capacity, not only to mobilise itself, but also to coordinate and organise itself, and to do so neighbourhood by neighbourhood, city by city, through a totally effective and impressive horizontal network. Just look at what they achieved with the first of six stages of the general strike in Syria, when they called on everyone not to go to the mosque, not to go shopping, to close shops early, to stay at home, not to make telephone calls, to carry out some form of civil disobedience. ‘Dead Syria’, just like the ‘dead city’ that is often referred to.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can see how impressive the organisation behind this is. What we have here is a population adopting the approach of civil disobedience and non-violent action. I do not really want to repeat what you have said regarding the report by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and which was picked up by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, but I do not get the feeling at all that we are now on the brink of civil war. What is certain is that growing numbers of soldiers, including those in the Free Syrian Army, are assuming the role of protectors of the people in coordination with local committees.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is absolutely essential that we offer our assistance in this very specific battle on the ground, which is being conducted in a non-violent manner with the Free Syrian Army offering defence and protection. This is where we must be effective, offering very simple but practical things: help with radios, communications, intelligence capabilities for the opposition, capabilities in the field of new technologies once sold to al-Assad, but which we must now supply to the opposition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are the concrete steps that we can take to strengthen their operational capability and I think …</p>

I thank the Commission, and indeed the Commissioner, for delivering on what she said she would.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, in relation to the Syrian National Council, whilst I welcome the recognition of it, I must say that it is not entirely inclusive. Therefore, we have to ensure that we keep the door open for all groups. Only last week, I hosted a conference in Parliament to which all opposition groups were invited. Many attended who were not part of the SNC. It is clear that, whilst of course it is right that they all maintain and indeed develop and promote their individual ideologies and policies, it is vitally essential that, unless they unite in the purpose of opposition, they will not realise their goals of freedom, democracy, transparency and, above all, the right to claim their country for themselves, a goal which the vast majority of Syrians want to achieve.</p>

I come from Cyprus, but I believe that the pressure being exerted by my colleagues for Turkey to participate in settling Syria’s problems should also be exerted on Turkey to liberate Cyprus, to allow between 200 000 and 300 000 people to return to their homes, and to withdraw the 40 000 troops it has stationed in Cyprus.

We therefore call on the Syrian Government to start a national dialogue with the political forces of the opposition, with a view to finding a peaceful, political exit from this dangerous situation immediately, before it is too late for the country and its people. If we, as the European Union, wish to play a decisive role in promoting democracy and human rights, we need to focus our efforts on stating …</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I have some urgent matters arising from the written and oral sources available to me on the appalling power struggle in Syria to bring to the attention of Baroness Ashton. Let me add this: the things I am about to say have been very much coloured by daily telephone contacts I have been having with a friend of mine, an Arabist, who is studying for a PhD in Damascus.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will just run through them: that is, my questions to you, Baroness Ashton. Are you maintaining direct contact with the Syrian National Council or is that reserved only for some of the more prominent Member States? What is your view of the revelation that, not only is this Syrian National Council dominated by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, but it also adopts a different slant when in dialogue with its foreign contacts (to whom it projects itself as anti-Iran and anti-Hezbollah) than it does domestically (where it projects itself as anti-Israel)?</p>
      <p sl="nl">My third question: if the Assad regime were to fall, the last and only secular state in the Middle East would disappear. That is stressed by every foreign – that is, not Syrian – analyst in Damascus that I have spoken to. What implications do you think that will have for Syrian religious minorities, which make up between 25 and 40% of the population?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Syrian domestic and international opposition leaders hold two conflicting views. Dialogue with the Assad regime versus a violent overthrow of the regime: that is, civil war. What do you think about something which a Syrian dissident to whom I spoke today proposed: namely, that we should make European support for the Syrian National Council conditional on their commitment to negotiating with the Assad regime, in order to prevent the country from disintegrating.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the latest television appearance of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was quite grotesque, as he denied any responsibility for the thousands killed in his country. There is a certain air of defiance in his claims that he has no fear of sanctions. The measures taken by the EU to date, such as the weapons embargo, the freezing of accounts and the bans on investment and on the import of oil, are certainly hitting the Syrian economy. As economic pressure is increasing, the noose around Assad’s neck is certainly tightening. This is the only way that Europe can exert pressure on the regime. We are largely in agreement with the Arab League on this issue. It is important that not only the West, but also the Arab League and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, should call on Assad to implement serious reforms and to end the bloodshed.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear that resistance is growing among the population. One only has to consider the latest general strikes. However, these will only hurt Assad when the capital, Damascus, and the economic centre, Aleppo, are hit. Both cities seem to be firmly in the grip of the dictator. Even though the Syrian opposition is now touring the world’s major political powers in an effort to drum up support, it must be clear that there can be no question of military intervention on the part of the European Union. If Assad gives in to the economic pressure and a civil war really does break out, we can certainly expect a flood of refugees. The European Union needs to take appropriate precautionary measures now.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, we are all agreed and have been for some months now. Mr al-Assad no longer has any legitimacy and must step down. The extent of the repression against his own people is totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After those made by the European Union and the United States, I welcome the Arab League’s decision to adopt coercive measures against the Syrian regime and to look for the most appropriate means for protecting civilians. We must continue to work together with the Arab League and Turkey. The Syrian regime’s days are numbered, but we must keep up the pressure on this disgraceful regime, which has already killed nearly 5 000 people. I call on the European Union and the international community to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, the Security Council’s silence is scandalous. The EU-Russia Summit this weekend is an opportunity to highlight the human consequences of this repression and to get Russia to review its position at the United Nations. If there is no end to these abuses soon, the country could plunge into civil war, and the region as a whole will suffer the fallout.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, the impunity with which the Syrian authorities have slaughtered 5 000 people or more is, obviously, intolerable and cries out for revenge. The way in which President Assad is shirking the responsibility for this is grotesque. The inability of the UN Security Council to adopt a clear resolution on this matter is frustrating, especially as more violence now seems imminent.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EU should continue its efforts to isolate the regime, to expand sanctions, to seek allies in the region. A regime that so brutally attacks its own people will fall, sooner or later. The only drawback is that we do not know if this will happen quickly or only after a bloody civil war has been waged with an opposition that feels compelled to arm itself.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is therefore essential that, in a country that has never known any real opposition, we help the opposition to organise itself in a way that will ensure all parties and communities feel represented. Baroness Ashton, I think that we, as the European Union, could help ensure that this opposition becomes stronger and more credible and that it is well organised.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to continue in the vein that Mr El Khadraoui has just outlined, because it is true that everything we have done so far has been insufficient. Neither the embargos nor the sanctions are achieving enough. The Syrian regime is still massacring the populace, and there is no other option than to carry on working to get the army to return to its barracks and to stop people from being massacred. This is why I believe we must continue working on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I would like to reiterate that we must strengthen the democratic opposition. It is true that they are activists, but we should focus on working with the Syrian National Council, regardless of who is in it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Syrian National Council is a fairly representative platform, not just outside Syria, but also inside the country. It should be regarded as a valid dialogue partner, being best placed to tell us what is happening there and how the international community and Parliament can support these efforts, because these efforts have …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are starting to gain an appreciation of the effects of the sanctions aimed at crippling the efficacy of the Syrian regime. Many opposition leaders have welcomed the sanctions as a means to cut off the government’s ability to maintain its massive security apparatus, but many observers have also stressed the damage that some of the sanctions are doing to the Syrian people, with skyrocketing prices for basic foodstuffs and the rapid devaluation of the Syrian pound.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to continue using sanctions. We should intensify our pressure against the selling of arms to the Syrian regime, and we should further penalise those providing military equipment or technological support. However, we should avoid impacting too much on ordinary citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, it is fundamental to promote the acceptance of an international role in ending the conflict in Syria. I am not talking about the acceptability of a Libya-like scenario for Syria, but of mediation undertaken by a multilateral entity like the UN, the EU, the Arab League or others. I would be glad to know what your ideas on this issue are.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Baroness Ashton stated that repression must come to an end in Syria and the phase of transition should begin.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, we are all wondering how this could actually come about: it is true that sanctions have become harsher, although we need to step them up further to make them more effective, but at the same time, the regime does not even listen to the Arab League any more.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore what is and what might become our future role? I think that Baroness Ashton’s efforts should, above all, focus on putting huge pressure on the UN, China and Russia, because if President Assad feels he has support in China and Russia, he will not feel isolated.</p>
      <p sl="it">The role these two nations are playing in the United Nations is truly objectionable, as is the funding that the European Union bestowed upon Syria – or rather on President Assad – until a few months ago. Was he not a dictator before now? Has he only just started depriving his country of freedom and democracy?</p>
      <p sl="it">We therefore need to step away from this concept of political correctness, in which anyone who does business with us is automatically considered worthy of financial concessions and a relationship with the European Union. In Syria …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have taken part in this extremely important debate, where we have looked at how we can best support the people of Syria.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to deal with a few of the issues that were raised. I will begin with what was said by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra at the beginning and to reassure honourable Members of the things that we are trying to do. We have strong economic sanctions, we keep them under constant review and we ratchet them up in order to try to put on as much pressure as possible. We hope that the new sanctions that the Arab League are going to put on will also have a strong effect in order to make the regime realise what they must do. That does include an oil embargo.</p>
      <p sl="en">We worked closely with the Arab League. That is why we invited Secretary-General al-Araby to come to the Foreign Affairs Council. We are supporting them in any way we can as they think about how to get monitors to do their deployment on the ground. So we have already made it clear that we will support them in any way that it is possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The idea of a humanitarian corridor has been dropped. Some ideas come and they are looked at and examined and then it is decided that they are not going to work in the way that we wanted. Therefore, that idea is no longer on the table. It is very important – as a number of honourable Members have said – that we continue to work in the Security Council to try to get a stronger, unanimous view on what needs to happen. Indeed I did raise this when I travelled to China and I raised this with the Foreign Minister of Russia when I was in Moscow very recently. We raised the problem with Syria – the difficulties to the people of Syria – in all of our international meetings.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just say to Ms De Keyser, we do meet with the opposition. We have met those who have come forward and asked to meet with us. We do not discriminate about whom we meet. We talk to them all, but we give the same messages about the need to be inclusive and to be supportive of the human rights of everybody who is concerned about what is happening in their country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have made it very clear that al-Assad must go, but I must correct something that Ms Schaake and Ms Flautre both said. It was not Cyprus that blocked Turkey coming to the Foreign Affairs Council. This is totally and utterly untrue. What happened was that we were asked, we discussed the matter and I invited the Secretary-General of the Arab League. He wished to come on an institution-to-institution meeting. The previous week, I had met with the Foreign Minister of Turkey – Foreign Minister Davutoglu – and I proposed at the Foreign Affairs Council, on the day that the Arab League were coming, that at the next meeting, we should invite Foreign Minister Davutoglu. I was supported in that by everyone, including Cyprus. So please, for the record, it really is important that you understand that it was not Cyprus blocking. I did not invite them because in discussion with the Arab League, they wanted to meet institution-to-institution. Therefore, I have invited the Foreign Minister of Turkey, whom I meet and discuss these issues with a great deal. I am looking forward very much to seeing him when he comes in January.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important, as everyone has said, to involve all groups. I am glad, Mr Karim, that you appreciate the ‘No disconnect strategy’ that has been announced today by Neelie Kroes. We are working very closely with her on that. That will be important because of the significance of technology, which a number of honourable Members have raised as well. We will continue to meet with all of the groups.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Belder, we do meet with the Syrian National Council. I have already met with them. It is not just Member States who meet with them, though I encourage Member States to meet with opposition parties and opposition leaders in order to get the breadth of our experience of what is happening and to look for ways in which we can support people more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are supporting the Arab League, Mr Arlacchi, in its efforts to try to move the situation on and to persuade the regime to understand what it has to do. We are very clear that al-Assad should go. We have made it very clear for some months that, frankly, if you behave in this way, if you kill your people, you have lost the rights for leadership. The important thing is to try to work with all our partners to put the pressure on.</p>
      <p sl="en">I just want to echo again the importance of getting the UN Security Council to now move on this. We will do everything we can, but we actually need international partners to really push forward with us on this, in order that we can get the maximum effect.</p>

      <p sl="en">The attacks throughout Syria perpetrated by the regime’s forces have increased in their brutality, with rape, torture and executions commonplace and more than 5 000 deaths reported, and are reminiscent of the ruthless tactics during the 1982 Hama massacre. President al-Assad must immediately cease the use of lethal force against peaceful protestors, stand down from power and allow the citizens of Syria to choose their own leaders by free and fair elections. Time is running out for the Baathist regime, and the international community must act decisively as it is likely according to the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that crimes against humanity have been committed. There is also looming danger that Syria may be plunged into a bloody civil war, with the Islamic Republic of Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia the other. I deeply regret the intransigence demonstrated by Russia and China at the United Nations Security Council in vetoing more hard-hitting sanctions against Damascus, and call for the High Representative to urgently increase her efforts to build an international consensus against the regime’s behaviour.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mário David and Marek Siwiec, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy (2011/2157(INI)) (A7-0400/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-505-000" speaker_id="96973" name="Mário David" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, our first report on the revision of the European Neighbourhood Policy has already clearly laid out the positions that Parliament is on course to take. It was with great satisfaction that we saw most of the principles and proposals that we have advocated in this House included in subsequent Commission and Council communications. I am grateful, moreover, for the excellent and constant collaboration and coordination that we have maintained throughout this time with Baroness Ashton and with Mr Füle and their offices.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Firstly, we have seen the stepping up of our relations with neighbouring peoples. By prioritising relations with the general population and with civil society organisations in particular, we will give a greater objectivity and a greater effectiveness to our neighbourhood policy, which claims to be exclusively founded on the universal values that we advocate and share.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would stress, however, that the EU does not intend to impose a predefined model or formula for political reform in third countries. However, when our taxpayers’ money is at stake, we must give more to those who are making better progress in realising the values in which we believe. This principle means that the faster a country progresses in its internal reforms, the more support it will get from the EU. The principle of ‘more for more’ is, as such, correct, fair and coherent. This means, obviously, that we anticipate having cases or countries where we will have ‘less for less’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The neighbourhood policy is now based on defending the pursuit of common values and the commitment to democracy, human rights, rule of law and good governance. However, this quest involves a greater accountability. Our partners are called upon to have greater responsibility in the process, and so we advocate the principles of greater differentiation, greater conditionality and ‘more for more’.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In taking a position of rapprochement towards our partners from the bottom up and with tailor-made policies, we are making the development and institutional capacity more effective, along with the ‘institutional building’ that we so wish to support, and which constitutes the basis of the rule of law and the democratic process, that we wish to see implemented as quickly as possible in neighbouring societies, economies and communities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The idea is to give a voice to citizens as well as to civil society movements that share our values, supporting organised movements that strive to effect positive and democratic change in our countries, improving rights for women and children, building and deepening principles of freedom, whether they be of expression, association, religious belief, the press, choice, etc. with fair elections, the fight against corruption, a rule of law, greater social justice, respect for minorities, protection of the environment and efficiency of resources.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The serious social and economic problems that our neighbours have to face must be the focus for immediate action. It is clear that, without our firm support, the democratic processes under way could fail. These are the ideas that we always uphold for the European political future of good neighbourliness. These are the proposals that make up the report which we present to you for voting.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Now is the time for action. For our part, we will continue to pay close attention and exercise the new powers of monitoring and control that are now with Parliament. To finish, I would like to thank my colleague, co-rapporteur and friend, Mr Siwiec, to whom I would like to express my special thanks for his remarkable work on the eastern aspect of this neighbourhood policy. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and all of you for your many suggestions proposing amendments that were put forward and that I believe have enriched our work. Lastly, a final word for the secretariat of the Committee and the policy advisers for their excellent support work, from which I have greatly benefited.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, today marks a very joyful day for all those who, for the entire year, have been reflecting on how Europe should shape its relations with its close neighbours. This report, which has been prepared during an unusual year, is now ready. The past year has been one in which a single great slogan has resounded throughout the world: change, change, change. People have clamoured for democracy, for a better life, for values that are so close to the heart of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Neighbourhood Policy was once designed as a kind of consolation prize for those countries which lay close to the European Union, but which would never be part of it. These included both countries which are nearby, for example, on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as countries in the East, which once formed part of the Soviet empire. Meanwhile, everything has changed. First of all, the attitude of the people living in these countries has changed, and so too has the position of the European Union towards these countries. We now realise that a policy of empty gestures, of hypocrisy, of maintaining relations with regimes whose stable governance turned out to be illusory, simply does not make sense. Investment in fiction and investment in dictatorships has turned out to be entirely pointless. This year, we heard the powerful voice of the people of North Africa who are demanding freedom and democracy, and who want to fight for core values. A few years ago, the same voice was heard from Kiev’s Maidan Square. At Maidan Square, millions of Ukrainians came out in force to demand the same as the people in Africa are demanding today. What, therefore, is the nature of this new neighbourhood policy developed by the European Commission? Here, I would like to express my enormous respect for the work of Commissioner Füle, who has taken the place reserved for the Commission. First and foremost, the neighbourhood policy means applying an integrated policy in relations with the East and with North Africa. Why a so-called integrated policy? When it comes to freedom, democracy and tolerance, there are no geographical divisions. People are, as we firmly believe, all equal. They all wish to live with dignity, be it in Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Tunisia or Egypt. This new policy is based on values close to our hearts, on the fight for democracy and freedom. It gives an opportunity to the people who want to fight for these values. In some cases, this struggle will be protracted. This is a new, people-oriented policy. Our desire is to create the foundation for this new policy, for these new relations. First of all, we want to achieve this by convincing societies that we wish to create opportunities for their people, through contacts with non-governmental organisations, leaders and the media. We want them to be convinced, and to convince those closest to them, that it is worth looking in the direction of Europe, and to the European Union as an institution which supports these values.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We assume that the speed of change will be determined by the countries themselves. We explain that the notion of ‘benchmarks’ amounts to doing as much as you want to do with our assistance. The ‘more for more’ rule, as Mário David has rightly said, also means ‘less for less’. You can take from one to give to another. Therefore, today marks a great celebration. All that is important to us, to the European Union, to the countries that gained freedom, is now on offer to those who live near us. We can complain and say that much still needs to be done both in the East and in North Africa, that we are dissatisfied with the situation in Azerbaijan, in Armenia. We can improve our policies in Georgia and Ukraine, we can talk about Moldova’s progress and point out that there is much yet to be done in Egypt and Tunisia. It is important, however, for us to ensure that matters proceed in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Mário, thank you for your cooperation over this report that we have written together. I would also like to thank the Commissioner who articulated such important matters in his communication. Finally, I would like to thank all those who helped us put these wise thoughts into words.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very grateful to Mr David and Mr Siwiec for their excellent report on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Since I came in front of the Committee on Foreign Affairs last May to present the new approach to the European Neighbourhood Policy, both Baroness Ashton and I have been determined to deliver on the commitments that we have taken. While I am fully aware that much remains to be done, let me give you a few highlights of what has been achieved so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the principles of mutual accountability and a shared commitment to universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, we have developed a new approach in which our interests and values converge more, investing in democracy. This explains why, for example, we have doubled our financial support to Tunisia this year, a country that has organised truly democratic elections and has made tangible progress in the areas of freedoms of expression and association.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we have taken even tighter sanctions against the regimes of Gaddafi in Libya, Lukashenko in Belarus, and Bashar al-Assad in Syria, while simultaneously working to intensify our cooperation with civil society. With these two latter countries, it is no longer business as usual. We have been working hard to deliver on extra European Union incentives that, to quote your report, ‘should be given to the neighbourhood countries to engage in the common goal of building deep democracy’.</p>
      <p sl="en">On money, we have overhauled our financial assistance to make our financial incentives more effective. We have set up a new spring programme of EUR 350 million for the southern partners and will create a similar one for our Eastern partners. The funding of the European Investment Bank was increased by EUR 1 billion, and EBRD eligibility was extended to the southern neighbourhood. The Commission has already provided EUR 20 million to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to ensure that it can swiftly start its operation in support of the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking ahead, it will be important to secure adequate funding for our neighbourhood policy under the next financial framework. Last week, the Commission has approved a 23% increase. I hope that the European Parliament will support this ambitious approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for access to markets, the Commission has asked the Council for a mandate to negotiate agreements on deep and comprehensive free-trade areas with Morocco, Jordan, Egypt and Tunisia. In the East, we have made progress on the DCFTA with Ukraine and have also decided to launch negotiations on DCFTAs with Georgia and Moldova.</p>
      <p sl="en">As for mobility, we have already launched comprehensive dialogues on migration, mobility and security with Tunisia and Morocco, which aim at preparing mobility partnerships, including agreements on repatriation of irregular migrants, but also on facilitation of visas for legitimate travel. After those already concluded with Georgia and Moldova, a new mobility partnership was concluded with Armenia on 27 October 2011. Of course, the extra incentives will be given as a matter of priority only to those countries that are firmly committed to the process of transformation and political reforms. This is to fully respect the principle ‘more for more’, which is at the heart of the new European Neighbourhood Policy approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">The renewed ENP is not only a partnership with governments; it is also a partnership with societies. The new Neighbourhood Civil Society Facility was launched in November with a EUR 22 million budget for this year. Unlike other existing instruments, this facility aims at empowering civil society to participate more actively in the reforms. We are advancing in the preparation of the European endowment for democracy. In addition, we have stepped up our engagement with civil society organisations in Belarus and Syria, as they can best support the necessary reforms and political change in those countries. The path of reform will be bumpy and difficult. This is why we need to be persistent in our support to our partners. Implementation of the new ENP approach needs to remain at the top of our political agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not only because historic events are taking place on our doorstep. It is because our destinies are linked, and our security depends so much on what happens in these countries. I count on your continued support in this endeavour.</p>

Thirdly, we need to find an effective and transparent support model in which we avoid creating instruments that overlap with those we already have. Even though we strongly support the specific aim of the new endowment for democracy that the Commissioner mentioned, we have a few question marks when it comes to the structure.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Fourthly, there will obviously be a strong focus now on our neighbours in the South, but we must not jeopardise a reasonable balance in relation to the support for our Eastern neighbours who want to keep their EU perspective alive. It is important that we do not let them down in this respect.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs focused more in the opinion which I prepared on the countries of North Africa, bearing in mind that, if we get on well with our neighbours and take care of them, it is as if we are taking care of our own home and our own family. We highlight the economic, social and education reforms on which we need to focus in order to help these communities. We also highlight the fact that the social partners need to step up their action. Finally, illegal immigration needs to be controlled and we need to prevent a ‘brain drain’. We also need to correlate and link the financial aid given by the European Union with whether or not these countries respect our positions on employment regulations.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to propose an observatory.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, strengthening the regional dimensions of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is one of the European Union’s priorities in the coming years. Further strengthening of both of the regional dimensions of the ENP, namely the southern dimension and the eastern dimension, should constitute an integral part of the central policy itself and should proceed while maintaining a proper balance between the two dimensions. The adoption of the Euro-Mediterranean strategy for energy efficiency, the promotion of Euro-Mediterranean interconnections in the electricity, gas and crude oil sectors, the development of a low-emission economy, effective waste management and nuclear safety are further elements of an intensified dialogue for the increased security of energy supply.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Union should undoubtedly engage in building closer cooperation in the field of research, development and education in order to create a common area of knowledge and innovation. The European Commission’s decision to allocate additional funding to the European Neighbourhood Policy seems fully justified. This support should be given to meet the needs of reform leaders and should be conditional on tangible progress and ambitions to move closer towards the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the situation in countries neighbouring the European Union is changing, and is changing dramatically. Our policies should therefore also be amended in line with those changes; they need to evolve. New governments and new structures are being established in North Africa. East of the European Union, unfavourable changes are taking place. There, democracy is dying or has never existed. The Belarusian authorities have no respect for human rights, while in Ukraine, these values are being neglected.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Consequently, the European Union has to change its point of view. We need to increase cooperation at regional level. Local authorities have a better understanding of how the programmes of the European Union should be used for the benefit of its citizens. This is why we should strengthen cross-border cooperation and make full provision for the border regions in our regional development and neighbourhood policies. Union funds should be moved from central national budgets to regional programmes. In this way, they will not be held hostage to national policies, which do not always work and often do not develop as we would wish.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), we focused instead on communications regarding the new partnership for mobility, for two reasons: because of the aspirations expressed, aspirations to rights, including, it would appear, the right to mobility, and also because, to date, our migration policy with these countries clearly rested in the iron fists of dictators who, I am glad to say, are no longer in place.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We therefore take a very positive view of the partnership for mobility but would like to question the link still established between the readmission agreements, legal migration and the fight against illegal immigration, relying solely on the report prepared by the Commission itself on readmission agreements. The report says that implementation is inconsistent and not transparent, that the negotiating mandate is unrealistic, that there are serious risks of human right violations and that even this assessment acknowledges that visa liberalisation has no impact on illegal immigration.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore think that a little further reflection is needed and then, above all, we need to develop an approach with these countries that is fully rooted in the mutual benefits of mobility, establishing a structured dialogue. And when we talk about partnership with civil society, this means both mobility and other issues, it is critical that this partnership with civil society, which is the key to success, includes a concrete mechanism for consulting civil society at all stages, early on during the implementation and evaluation.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have two different neighbouring regions, one to the east and one to the south. Naturally, there are certain fundamental principles we hold in common. The most significant of our shared neighbours to the east is Russia. This can sometimes make life difficult. I believe, however, that the European Neighbourhood Policy should act as a signal to Russia that we intend to recognise our neighbours as independent countries. They are our partners and must make decisions for themselves, including, for example, in relation to Ukraine’s association agreements. Nonetheless, as I have said, we certainly want to see them as friends, and we also want them to enjoy friendly relations with Russia. We must, however, fully recognise the independence of our neighbours. Naturally, we also want the closest possible relations with these neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Commissioner Füle has already clearly stated with regard to our southern neighbourhood, it is very important for us that we should not simply take one or other election result we do not like as a reason to abandon these relationships to some degree, or to place them on the back burner. When we hear of election results that alarm us, because they seem to strengthen Islamist or fundamentalist forces, this makes it all the more important to enter into dialogue with the countries in question, with their people and, of course, with their governments. That is the message from our two rapporteurs.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us allow our neighbours a genuine opportunity for true partnership. This is an offer from the European Union that they really should accept.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs for this excellent report and thanking Commissioner Füle for his comments.</p>
      <p sl="de">It seems that we are at what I would call an awkward juncture in the history and the development of the European Union. We are personally, as far as the Union is concerned, clearly in a very difficult situation, and in a situation which is such that some of our Member States, or most of our Member States, might be less inclined to show generosity and comprehension vis-à-vis neighbouring Member States which are at various stages of development towards being democracies functioning according to our rules.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am personally slightly distressed when I learn that several Member States are, for instance, very reluctant to open their market to agricultural products coming from some of our southern neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the same time, these same governments, same populations, are extremely demanding when it comes to the democratic criteria that those societies should be fulfilling. But that is very difficult. When you cannot develop your economy because you cannot export the products you are best at producing for the time being, it is very difficult to build development.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to conclude by saying that I agree very much with what our colleague, Mr Swoboda, said. We are the ones who insisted on elections. We are the ones who insisted on having elections soon. The people have not always voted the way we would have preferred, but it is now going to be our business to engage both with the new executives and with the civil societies within all of our neighbouring countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">We have just had the debate about the situation in Syria. For this reason, I wish to state quite categorically: we must learn from the mistakes we have made in dealing with the Arab despots. As we look to the East, this means: no poor compromises with Lukashenko and no shady deals with Yanukovych. We cannot countenance a new agreement while the opposition still languishes in prison.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Siwiec has referred to the need to strengthen civil society. We should not let this simply become a statement of good intentions. The Civil Society Forum of the Eastern Partnership is an important component of the neighbourhood programme. A good start has been made, as recently witnessed at the meeting in Poznań. That is why it is important that we should support existing approaches at this point and call for coordination with the EU through a dedicated secretariat.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, very often when we talked about our neighbours, we used the term ‘stabilisation’. Today, we should feel ashamed of having talked about ‘stabilisation’, because we often did so out of concern for our own comfort zone, to feel good about ourselves. Frequently, the term ‘stabilisation’ was not accompanied by any real will to conduct a dialogue with our neighbours – the neighbours of the European Union. It is excellent that the concept of ‘stabilisation’ does not feature in the Siwiec and David report. It is also excellent that Commissioner Füle, who is listening to us, does not use the term ‘stabilisation’. We should be talking about integration. Integration does not always mean fast accession to the European Union. For many countries, this is certainly not possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to talk now about our neighbours to the east. There, we really must talk about a reunification with Europe, about integration, knowing that this is a very difficult and long road. We must be realistic, but we must forget about stabilisation, because stabilisation, in our European Union language, often meant supporting regimes, and we should be honest with ourselves about this. So, on the one hand, I am glad that there is more money for neighbourhood policy in the new budget, but I would like to ask the Commissioner, and anybody else involved, to allocate money to the EFD (European Fund for Democracy), which is the fruit of the Polish Presidency, and to make sure that this money will be forthcoming. This is a specific instrument which shows that we want integration, particularly with the younger generation. This is why we should be talking about a new breath of life as regards the Eastern Partnership, about some great initiative – maybe the University of the Eastern Partnership? We must achieve this. We must send signals today that despite internal problems, despite the crisis in the Union, we have something new to offer. This is what our neighbours need today, and especially the younger generation. If we fail to do this now, there will surely come a moment when we need their support for some issue or other, and they will then remember that we rejected them in difficult times.</p>

      <p sl="es">As you know, Mr Füle, our position on the neighbourhood policy is very critical, because the Arab Spring revealed it for what it was. The neighbourhood policy made the European Union a necessary collaborator with Ben Ali and Mubarak. We were not there and nobody expected us; it all happened without the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We think that, on the issue of the neighbourhood policy, we should clear up once and for all whether compliance will ever be required with Article 2 of the association agreement, one of the neighbourhood policy instruments, which makes the agreement conditional on strict respect for human rights, and whether any association agreement will ever be frozen if a regime fails to comply with it.</p>
      <p sl="es">So far, this has never happened. We have gone through the experience of the Arab Spring, and right now we have a problem with some states, such as Morocco and Israel, with which we have association agreements. Morocco, which has an advanced statute, held elections with a voter participation rate of only 23% – just 23% – according to official figures. Morocco is unlawfully occupying part of the territory of Western Sahara. Will Article 2 be applied at some point? Are we ever going to use it, Mr Füle?</p>

Another important element is the effort to strengthen cooperation with civil society. The Council quite rightly adopted the proposal to establish the European Foundation for Democracy to assist political parties and trade associations. I welcome the decision to approve an additional 23% funding, along with the expansion of the European Bank into the regions, and I consider that the success of the European Neighbourhood Policy will create conditions that encourage the inhabitants of these regions to remain in their states and will have an significant impact in helping to reduce immigration, both legal and illegal.

Every one of us acknowledged that the processes of the Arab Spring are welcome and forward-looking.

      <p sl="bg">We must also thank Mário David and Marek Siwiec for the great efforts they have made throughout the year in ensuring that Parliament reached an overall position which will help us present our view to our voters as well. I believe that they expected us to be active and present our ideas for developing relations with our neighbours both to the east and to the south.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Incidentally, Parliament also made its contribution to expanding multinational cooperation at parliamentary level by creating the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly.

There have been widespread popular protests across the Mediterranean southern shores brought about by the fall of despotic regimes, and to the east continuing tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, and Georgia with Russia, and a clear deterioration in the democratic values in Ukraine, with the arrest of the leading opposition figures.</p>
      <p sl="en">The recent victories for Islamist parties in Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco beg the question of whether the Arab Spring will shortly become the Arab Winter, as hopes for multiparty, pluralist free market democracies fade in the Middle East and North African countries.

The European Union must support these processes of democratic change, drastically altering its former complacency, which gave the impression of aiming for stability but was nothing more than inertia.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Article 8 of the Treaty of Lisbon states, our neighbourhood policy should be based on universal values such as human dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law, as well as having conditions and specific requirements, since not all processes are the same. There should be country-specific procedures in each case.</p>
      <p sl="es">In any event, we must embark upon dialogue with new political groups, including moderate Islamist forces, based on the values mentioned previously. We should strengthen our relations with these countries, their political and social forces and their civil societies. This is a job for the EU institutions and also for European political and social groups.</p>
      <p sl="es">Aside from the political support, we must provide economic and financial aid to these countries. Commercial opening should be gradual.

Parliament cannot fail to evaluate this conditionality, and it is bound to have a bearing on the issues of human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance and combating corruption as elements in its evaluation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I would just like to say a word, first, on the implementation of the new ‘more for more’ approach. Last week’s announcement that there is to be a 40% increase in the budget for the European Neighbourhood Instrument is very positive, especially since, according to this new approach, it will be distributed to satisfy both the needs and efforts of recipient countries. Naturally, good students should be rewarded more than those who are less diligent, but when it comes to learning about democracy, care must be taken to encourage all progress, even the tiniest. However, I see no signs of this distinction either in the Commission’s communication or in the latest conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also like to make one more comment about the Union for the Mediterranean, which is a key player in bringing the two shores of the Mediterranean closer together. Involving the UfM is an undeniable factor in the success in areas such as the environment, economic development or young people. The same will be true for support for democratic transitions. However, the EU must also do its share of the work. As the rapporteurs point out, the multilateral component of the European Neighbourhood Policy should serve to aid the early, effective launch of UfM projects.</p>

The Arab Spring has shown that, in the age of the Internet, regimes that appear tough are collapsing like a house of cards. Many colleagues have mentioned the report’s successful proposition of ‘more for more and less for less’. I believe that this principle is important in relation to the Belarusian regime. The European Union is rightly toughening sanctions against managers and the companies they control, but sanctions and trade restrictions should not have a detrimental effect on the already difficult lives of ordinary citizens in Belarus, where there has been raging hyperinflation. It is regrettable that the Belarusian authorities have not responded to the Brussels initiative to ease the visa regime, particularly because, as proposed in the report, we need to move more swiftly towards a visa waiver with those eastern countries that meet the requirements set.</p>

At a time when Soviet-style rule is making a comeback in Ukraine and Russia, the European Union must not divert its attention from the east.</p>

      <p sl="it">The huge leap forwards which this new phase has brought about must be achieved with strength and determination, to build the conditions for our support for the transition processes taking place.

      <p sl="it">Nevertheless, we have to remain involved and not turn our backs on the situation. We should instead monitor these changes, paying closer attention and increasing our involvement.

      <p sl="it">These should be the cornerstones of a new neighbourhood policy if it is to be effective and not run into the mistakes of the past. I hope that the good work carried out by Commissioner Füle continues in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, the European Neighbourhood Policy has our warm support, especially in the light of the new course that is now being steered. I will focus on one small aspect of it, namely ENPI, the instrument for cooperation across the EU’s external borders. This concerns small-scale joint projects, sometimes involving cooperation between hospitals, sometimes involving cooperation between universities, projects which involve tangible contact between individuals.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For the 2007-2013 period, we have siphoned money away from the Regional Fund for ENPI. As part of a parliamentary study, a hearing, we have examined how well it has been functioning and concluded that it is barely functioning at all. We are also aware that the emphasis has been on capital cities, in particular, and that people in the regions, who are our partners, have had a tough time catching up with the cities. In recital 8, the report clearly indicates that, in the future, we need to employ more of those ERDF and Interreg cooperation methods. That is a very important signal, in my view. We simply need to pick that up in order to improve efficiency, as well as flexibility. These are, therefore, things that can be implemented very easily.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Polish Presidency said something similar, just now, in its conclusions. You, therefore, have our support for this approach, but the ENPI does need to find a better way of functioning and one that is more cross-border-oriented. Our policy is not that capital cities should take centre stage, but the very projects that are closest to the people. Commissioner, how are we going to tackle this? I am a member of the Committee on Regional Development and would like to develop this further with you in the next regulation. We were able to work under an enhanced procedure this time around and I am given to understand that Mr Brok and his people will allow us to do that again.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, Turkey is a candidate country for accession to the European Union, but I believe that the EU’s foreign policy cannot wait for the outcome of this process. Turkey should therefore be drawn more into the European Union’s foreign policy, including by means of the European Neighbourhood Policy. It is therefore necessary for the Commission, as well as the External Action Service, to find any possible ways of drawing Turkey into the European Neighbourhood Policy. We can see that Turkey is active in promoting democratic reforms in the southern neighbourhood of the European Union. We need to draw both Turkish institutions and also non-governmental organisations into the European Neighbourhood Policy, which would create a synergistic effect. We need to restore a structured dialogue between the EU and Turkey in order to coordinate the neighbourhood policy of both countries. Finally, I believe that, in light of new trends, such an approach also needs to be applied to Russia.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs for having brilliantly handled the difficult task of bringing together these two neighbourhood policies, while also extending my gratitude to Commissioner Füle, who is trying to bring some political structure to this neighbourhood process, something that was lacking in the past. For different reasons, these regions are of great strategic importance to us, which is why we are not just helping these countries, but actually acting in our own interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is clear to me that these countries are free to make their own decisions, that people have the feeling that we support their freedom and their way of life, and that we need to see both of these elements existing in harmony if this is to work. That is why structured aid is important to me – aid that happens faster, that includes opportunities for growth, employment and education and that can be provided where it is needed rather than simply commissioning studies. In the past, we were content with the soft option of simply commissioning studies on issues such as expansion in Central and Eastern Europe and other questions. The money then went to Germany, the UK or the Netherlands, where the recipients of the studies were located, rather than to the countries that needed it. I believe that improvements are in order here, so that the money really reaches people on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to promote the multilateral process. In North Africa, for example, 15% of trade is purely internal. If the multilateral approach is promoted, then there are enormous opportunities for growth, as well as opportunities to come together more closely on a political level, overcoming disputes between countries because incentives are provided, offering benefits when countries cooperate. Nonetheless, it should not always only be our bilateral relations with the relevant countries and the associated free trade zones, association agreements, perhaps, in particular, the Eastern Neighbourhood, that have a European perspective. I would say that it is important to discuss issues relating to the European Economic Area. However, the same applies to our willingness to open our borders in the interests of fair trading conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I believe it is important to place greater emphasis on the question of promoting democracy and that the idea of an endowment foundation is a good one. You should, however, reconsider whether this cannot be achieved at Community level. We have a lot of money in the pot, as well as an instrument for supporting human rights, etc. We should make use of this before it atrophies. It would be a major mistake if we were to allow this to become an intergovernmental arrangement.</p>

Given that it is five years since Romania and Bulgaria became EU Member States, I call on the Commission to develop a European Union strategy for the Black Sea. This region is of paramount importance as part of the European Union’s external strategy in the energy sector. I should also stress the need for cross-border cooperation in the Danube region, given that the EU strategy for the Danube region adds significant value to the EU’s policy for Eastern Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The first point is the concern of many Algerians regarding current reforms and, in particular, the law on associations to be voted on in the Algerian Parliament. Algerian civil society is concerned that this law could stifle society as a result of two new things that it introduces. Firstly, all associations will have to apply for a licence in order to exist. Secondly, foreign funding, including European, will no longer be allowed.</p>

As a concrete example, I would quote the interest of Russia and Ukraine in the extension of the broad-gauge railway deeper into the European Union. Currently, this railway ends at the Ukrainian border, and goods transported from the eastern coast of Asia cannot proceed smoothly into Europe. Many European companies would, however, make good use of such a transcontinental main line in the opposite direction to transport their products to the emerging Asian region. The joint profit from employment and economic development would certainly be beneficial for a better understanding between Europe and the participating countries.</p>

The European Union needs to advance its work on visa facilitation and gradually move to a visa-free regime. I would like to emphasise that attention should be paid to young people, the enhancement of synergies between Youth on the Move and the European Neighbourhood Policy, an increase in cooperation in the field of academic education and vocational training and the promotion of exchanges between higher education institutions and public-private partnerships for research and entrepreneurship.

As external borders, the outermost regions transmit our values of democracy, peace, respect for human rights and fundamental rights to the third countries in these regions. Regions such as the French overseas departments absolutely need to be more integrated into their geographical areas. As they are far from the internal market of the Union, this integration is vital to their development and represents huge potential for the further development of the European Neighbourhood Policy with neighbouring third countries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, our debate has put the wind in the sails of this new policy. The entire debate that has taken place in the European Parliament has put the wind in the sails of the changes under way, changes in which we have participated. We are participating in the better world which these changes aim to build, and we are also building a part of this better world for ourselves. Four hundred amendments to this document were tabled. We incorporated the amendments into our document.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, those were very encouraging words. I am grateful for them. Let me share with this House a couple of personal points as a reflection on this very productive debate. It is not the first, and will not be the last, on the important issue of our relationship with our neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first point is the importance of our addressing the internal and the external challenges at the same time because, whenever we try to forget the external challenges and focus only on the internal, or the other way around, we become not stronger, but weaker. It is that balance – taking care of our internal needs, strengthening integration – which enables us to be stronger externally also. It is that balance which turns challenges into opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point is on defending our borders, a subject mentioned in the debate. I am in favour of strong external borders; I am in favour of defending strong external borders; but I am against walls. We worked very hard to remove the wall dividing our continent and we should not, at the end of the process, try to rebuild that wall around our external borders. We need strong borders but ones which will be open, as one of you put it, for commodities such as democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">My third point is that I appreciate that the main aspect of interaction with this distinguished House is not this kind of plenary meeting – although such meetings have a huge importance – but the operational steering that both the Commission and the European Parliament have been engaged in for some time already. It is that operational steering which will help us to address a number of issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some of you mentioned regional cooperation and cross-border cooperation. Others have a number of ideas about how to approach intelligent conditionality. By the way, sooner or later, I will be working very hard on that arrangement, and will come to this House with the High Representative to discuss our ideas about how to deal with ‘more for more’ principles. It is one thing to include such conditionality in our philosophical or conceptual approach to neighbourhood policy, but another thing to determine the relevant criteria. How exactly is it going to work? How exactly, according to what formula, are you going to spend those EUR 350 million in the framework of the Arab Spring? These are important questions and they need to be answered in dialogue with this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cooperation with this House is also important if we are not to lose our way on the difficult road before us, because we are entering uncharted territory. Books will be written about what kind of reaction we provide. To help ensure we do not lose our way, I do not only need the input of this House; I also need you to help us to learn from our own mistakes and, sometimes, misjudgments, and provide us with feedback.</p>
      <p sl="en">My fourth point is to reaffirm that democracy and women’s rights go hand in hand. Our neighbourhood policy will help those trying to break the political, economic and social barriers to equality, through measures ranging from enshrining women’s rights in new constitutions and laws to practical ways of supporting women in meeting their everyday challenges. This is a priority we are promoting across the board, and I am glad the European Parliament report shares that vision.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has also been concern about the possibility of our moving funds from the EU development and humanitarian aid budget to the neighbourhood policy instrument. It is a fact that the European Union budget is finite; it cannot expand for ever, so we have to make choices. But let me make it absolutely clear that those funds we have already reallocated to the neighbourhood policy instrument from the development cooperation instrument came from allocations for middle-income countries where absorption was low.</p>
      <p sl="en">My sixth and last point is that we will be issuing our next progress report on the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy next spring. I hope to be able to inform you in more detail on that occasion about what we are doing to deliver on the renewed ENP and the results of our policy. In the meantime, I need all the interaction, and all the support, you can provide because we are talking not only about a new neighbourhood but also about a new commitment, a new engagement and a new philosophy as regards our relationship with our neighbourhood.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Parliament’s contribution to the process of assessing the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is, apart from anything else, surely necessary in order to demonstrate our continuing interest in this topic. Perhaps our recommendations will also help us to avoid being caught on the hop quite as much as we were by the onset of the Arab Spring at the start of this year. In its conclusions, the assessment could also limit efforts to ‘purchase democracy’ for Belarus for USD 9 billion, and rule out a repeat of the undignified level of Member State participation at ENP events such as this year’s Eastern Partnership summit in Warsaw. The qualified Polish Presidency did not deserve something like this. My reservation applies to the current government of the Czech Republic. As far as the Southern dimension of the ENP is concerned, when implementing the European Parliament’s recommendations it is essential to respect the distinct civilisations, cultures, religions and historical traditions of the countries of this region. The success of the ENP in the Mediterranean area is virtually a conditio sine qua non . We must also explain to our voters why political Islam is no longer a concern. Suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, for example, was seen as part of the war against terrorism for the past 10 years. We also need to convince our voters that spending their money on the Southern dimension will not result in an Arab Winter. If we do not do this, it will surely be Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen and Pia Kjaersgaard who do the ‘explaining’ instead of us.</p>

This year has been full of upheavals for the countries neighbouring us to the south. However, this does not mean that the countries to the east are not a priority. Many things have changed since the neighbourhood policy was launched. In actual fact, progress has been made recently. The European Union does not wish to impose itself as a model, but there are certain values which we should not abandon, even in these circumstances. The freedom of expression as well as press freedom are vital to the process of democratisation in the countries neighbouring the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) is a highly important policy. It should be emphasised that, in the resolution on this issue, explanatory point B now includes the rather vague formulation ‘the EU-ENP should be value-based’. It is not clear from this vague formulation how individual EU countries will cover the unpaid debts of the Gaddafi regime, nor is it clear whether tacit support for the various Islamic groupings that have grown far stronger in the recent elections in the Arab states of the Maghreb is the answer. A question arises as to what values will be promoted by the Union as a whole, and what values will be promoted by individual states. The creation of Euro-Mediterranean Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes is clearly a positive step. It is not clear from the resolution as a whole, however, whether the policy towards neighbouring states in the immediate future will be based on EU openness towards these partners, or on looking for ways to strengthen the external borders of ‘fortress Schengen’. It is very noticeable that the resolution makes no criticism whatsoever of dictatorial aspects of the regime in Georgia, and has somehow overlooked the constant procrastination over declaration of a Palestinian state. The parts relating to Belarus overstep the boundaries of good taste by meddling in the internal affairs of a neighbouring state, while skating over many negative aspects of Turkish foreign policy, for example, on the occupied area of Cyprus. For these reasons, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left cannot support this motion for a resolution.</p>

Respect for human rights and the basic freedoms, for democracy and the rule of law, are the EU’s common principles and objectives, which must really become common values shared by our neighbouring partners.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Secondly, consistency in terms of values must be translated into consistency in political action. We must therefore acknowledge the positive results achieved by our neighbourhood policy, as in the case of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, but also the adverse developments, as in the case of Belarus and Ukraine, and draw the necessary conclusions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The eastern states neighbouring us which have shown a clear commitment to building genuine democracy and carrying out the necessary reforms should be given the definite prospect of European integration.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Lastly, consistency must be a feature of our approach to our whole neighbourhood. As I have emphasised already in this Chamber in the past, differentiation must be the basic criterion which applies to both the southern and eastern neighbourhoods.</p>

      <p sl="fr">At long last, the European Parliament realises the importance of territorial and regional cooperation in its priorities for the next neighbourhood policy. The focus of the previous European Neighbourhood Policy was primarily on bilateral ENP action plans mutually agreed by the EU and each partner. We now also need to think about multilateral and local cooperation. We must focus our efforts on the southern component of this policy to provide long-term support for the democratic transition, economic development and regional integration of our southern neighbours. We therefore need to strengthen the cross-border dimension of this neighbourhood policy, as it represents only 5% of the overall budget of the ENPI. This dimension may act as a catalyst for many structural initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean. Establishing a genuine EU-Mediterranean partnership means not only taking the aspirations of the peoples into greater account, but also providing real investment in concrete projects. Local and regional cooperation arrangements ‘cemented’ on a daily basis between the North and South will do the same, if not more, for the democratisation of southern countries as major bilateral agreements void of operational variations.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Andres Perello Rodriguez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption (COM(2010)0490 – C7-0278/2010 – 2010/0254(COD)) (A7-0224/2011).</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and their assistants and collaborators, as well as the secretaries, for the work they have done, because I believe it is thanks to them that we have managed to reach a hard-fought and difficult agreement on first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are putting forward for debate a report that, in principle, should have been simple but has been extremely complex, as can be seen in the fact it has run five months over its initial timetable. However, we have ended up with a report that meets the two objectives set: firstly, to ensure the greatest possible clarity in the labelling of juices and certain similar products, and secondly, to guarantee the highest possible quality in the contents and ingredients of these juices.</p>
      <p sl="es">This agreement could be said to be the best possible outcome and can be summarised by highlighting the features of the main points on which we have reached agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, the rules we will surely approve tomorrow, and which I ask you to vote in favour of, fully maintain the distinction between pressed fruit juices – also called fresh juices – juices from concentrate and fruit nectars. Of these, the first two – pressed juices and juices from concentrate – will not be allowed to contain added sugars once the rules come into force. This means they will be sold to consumers in their pure state and, by definition, only fruit nectars may be sweetened.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nutrition claims of the ‘no added sugars’ type will vanish under the rules on labelling. For a limited length of time, however, a note may be included on packaging to clarify the situation for consumers, informing them that no juice may contain added sugars following the date of approval. Our aim is to ensure clarity and transparency at all times.</p>
      <p sl="es">A much-needed dose of clarity is being introduced in the area of mixed juices, with the juice’s name having to be the same as its main fruit ingredient. This means the various fruit ingredients in the juice must be listed in descending order.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our discussions on the best way of ensuring equal treatment for all products consumed in the European Union, whether manufactured within the Union or not, were no less complex. In this area, we also reached an agreement that, with a few exceptions about products which do not greatly affect juice, and which must abide by the Codex Alimentarius, has resolved the matter in this directive quite well.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is no exaggeration if I tell you that Parliament has listened to all the sectors involved – farmers, consumers and manufacturers. Maybe the Council and the Commission should have paid more attention to the farmers, because although it is true their request arrived a little late, it is no less true, as I see it, that they were paid little heed.</p>
      <p sl="es">There will probably be someone who can say they did not get their way 100%. In a report such as this one, with many interests involved, even if this may not seem to be the case, it is impossible for everyone to get their way in the negotiations. I am not referring to the Council, the Commission and Parliament, since everyone knows about the codecision procedure, but also the sectors involved – the industry, consumers and farmers.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I can assure you that, if any sector has the slightest complaint or feels that it has not got its own way, it is definitely not the consumer sector. This is something I can say quite clearly.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why we feel we have done a good job, and it is on this basis that I ask you to support this report with your vote.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, honourable Members, I should like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Perello Rodriguez, and all the members of the parliamentary Committee on the Environment, for their work and commitment in reaching this agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the agreement that was reached between the three institutions on the amendment of the directive on fruit juices. This directive on fruit juices contains a number of provisions ensuring the free movement of goods within the European Union, their quality, and, as Mr Perello Rodriguez pointed out, consumer protection. The compromise reached sets out the key points, particularly in terms of consumer information, and meets the requirements of Parliament on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to point out that this is one of the first proposals by the Commission in the agricultural sector following the ordinary legislative procedure established by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. I appreciate all the more that through joint efforts between our institutions, discussions were able to be finalised at first reading. I think that it was a really good experience for everything that lies ahead in this ordinary procedure in the agricultural field.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This proposal for a directive introduces a few new provisions. For example, it prohibits the addition of sugars to fruit juices and also specifies the timeframe during which the consumer can be informed of this ban, as stated by Mr Perello Rodriguez.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some of the existing provisions have also been elaborated in greater detail. For example, the provision relating to ‘multifruit’ juices has been revised so that the consumer is clearly informed by the product name of the list of fruits that make up the juice. Similarly, at the request of Parliament, the three institutions agreed on the fact that fruit nectars containing sweeteners could not be marked ‘no added sugar’ on the label.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Also at the request of Parliament, we have introduced a new article confirming that, in addition to goods produced in the European Union, imported goods must also comply with the directive. Lastly, other provisions, such as the distinction between fruit juice and juice from concentrate, have not been aligned with the Codex standard which, in this case, is less demanding. On this point, we are therefore more stringent than Codex standards. This decision, approved by a large majority of Member States and supported by Parliament, therefore meets our objective of encouraging better consumer information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With this agreement on the amendment of the directive on fruit juices and similar products, we now have a legislative text that clarifies certain requirements of the current directive, enriches it with new provisions, and thereby fulfils the objectives that were set.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to voice my agreement on the compromise established and rubber stamped by the Permanent Representatives Committee (COREPER) on 18 November. I therefore hope that there will be a positive vote on the agreement reached.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the purpose of this proposal for a directive is to improve certain provisions relating to the composition, use of reserved descriptions, production specifications and the labelling of fruit juices, with the aim of ensuring better distribution within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The report is a second amendment to Directive 2001/112/EC and aims to make a better distinction between fresh fruit juices and fruit juices from concentrate and nectars. We wanted the rules to be simplified for restoring flavours and to introduce the mention of sugar being removed from the list of authorised ingredients. At the same time, there is also the proposal to authorise a limited period for having the description ‘with no added sugar’ printed on fruit juice labelling.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As far as the producers are concerned, we must give them the necessary period of time to adapt to this situation of producing juices with no added sugar and to inform consumers of all their products in every country that there will be new products available in stores without this description at the same time as existing products.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We must not forget that consumers themselves must be kept informed of all the changes envisaged by the new directive. Last but not least, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on this particularly important report.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-559-000" speaker_id="4319" name="Pilar Ayuso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Perello on the enormous amount of work he has done, on his readiness to collaborate with all the shadow rapporteurs, and also to congratulate the shadow rapporteurs on the way they have all worked with each other. I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="es">The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed.</p>
      <p sl="es">The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled.</p>
      <p sl="es">The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for the excellent work which he has done.</p>
      <p sl="it">It certainly cannot have been easy for such a complex directive to manage to combine the demands of consumers with those of business, just as, to encourage free movement within the European Union, it was not easy to lay down rules on composition, manufacturing specifications and labelling of fruit juices and similar products.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are now at the second amendment of Council Directive 2001/112/EC, which has been necessary in order to continue including provisions of the Codex Alimentarius in European legislation.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am extremely satisfied and I consider the fact that we have avoided the serious risk of finding orange juice on our table which is actually a blend of oranges and mandarins, unless it has been properly labelled as such when sold, a victory both for consumers and for our market.</p>
      <p sl="it">The new changes will finally allow consumers to understand the difference between fruit juices and fruit nectars, and if the fruit nectar naturally contains sugars, then the label can state that the juice contains natural sugars.</p>
      <p sl="it">Important progress has been made, above all, with regard to nectar, and I believe that the directive is going in the right direction to help consumers make informed choices in terms of what they purchase.</p>
      <p sl="it">In Europe, the fruit juice market represents 10% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. I hope that in future, we will be able to encourage purchases of locally produced products that reflect high quality and sustainable development in agriculture in line with European food security principles.</p>
      <p sl="it">The annual demand for orange juice from European industry is estimated to be around a million tonnes, whilst internal production only provides 10% of that. It is therefore obvious that we should increase production of citrus fruits and I hope that the new CAP will include financial incentives to encourage an increase in the cultivation of citrus fruits and the associated creation of a virtuous food and agricultural supply chain to utilise fruit that cannot be used in the fresh market due to small defects or size in the production of fruit juices. This request is obviously directed at Commissioner Cioloş, who is here today.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, Mr President, I believe that this directive achieves two fundamental aims: a more complete labelling system and an increase in product quality.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we heard all about it this morning in another debate: how Europe finds it decidedly difficult to speak with one voice, even when it comes to fruit juices.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Germany opposed the text from the beginning, preferring to protect its own producers of concentrated fruit juice. For its part, Spain, and particularly the region of Valencia, the leading European orange juice producer, was happy to see it mixed with mandarin juice. This is what they do – so they say – in Brazil, a serious competitor and the world’s leading producer and supplier of 80% of the orange juice consumed by Europeans. For Europe is actually a very attractive market: every year, we drink 300 million litres of orange juice, or half of global consumption.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That just goes to show that the agreement reached, dragged out and produced by our rapporteur, Mr Perello Rodriguez, who I would also like to thank, with the European Parliament delegation, the Polish Presidency and the Commission, was anything but clear at the outset. That is why, on behalf of my group, I support the excellent compromise that was finally reached, which focuses on product quality but also clear consumer information</p>
      <p sl="fr">From now on – and it has been a hard-fought battle, mainly with Carl Schlyter – giving a juice or a nectar the name of a minor ingredient: strawberry juice, for example, where the main fruit in the drink is, in fact, apple, will no longer be allowed. This is very common practice at present. It is therefore a real paradigm shift, which will take some getting used to. A further key provision, this time in terms of health, is the practice of adding sugar to fruit juices now being prohibited. Here again, we have another latency period. It was ultimately important that the directive maintained national specificities through the unambiguous designation of products as a ‘fruit juice’, ‘fruit juice made from concentrate’ or ‘nectar’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will end with an urgent appeal to the Commission and the Commissioner, in particular, its influential Directorate for Agriculture: European fruit and vegetable growers are suffering. They are suffering because of the crisis and because of international competition. Keep listening to them, please, and do not promote the marketing of products from elsewhere –China, for example, or anywhere else for that matter.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to thank everyone involved in the negotiations. At times, the negotiations were rather amusing. It could be considered strange that we have spent so many hours on such a limited subject as fruit juices, but at the same time, it was question of rather important principles. Should we maintain the EU’s high standard, where one exists, as opposed to the standard incorporated into international agreements? If we are to have a properly functioning single market, we must stop deceiving consumers.</p>
      <p sl="sv">During the negotiations, I brought these juice cartons with me and I am still bringing them with me right to the bitter end. Here is one example of juice packaging: high quality, full of lovely cranberries. The problem is that cranberries are not the main ingredient of the juice – it is apple. However, I do not see apple mentioned on the packaging or in the name. This is a product from France.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here I have a product from Sweden/Finland. It is called raspberry/blueberry and there are raspberries and blueberries on the packaging. Hidden behind an enormous blueberry there is a very tiny apple. This is misleading, because this juice consists mostly of apple – it contains 10 times as much apple as raspberry and blueberry. Here is another fruit drink that is also sold on the European market. It has lovely strawberries and passion fruit on the packaging, but what do you think is the dominant fruit? It is apple, of course.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Here is another one that is sold in six other countries in Europe. It states strawberry here, but do you think it contains any strawberries? Yes, it contains a very small amount of strawberries, but as usual it is mostly apple, and the apple on this packaging is hidden behind a symbol so that you can barely see it. This is misleading and fraudulent, and we are at last doing something about it. This is what I have been fighting for, and I am very pleased that this was the end result.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Then we also have another issue relating to how the product is labelled, in other words, what is said about the product. To start with, there was a certain amount of confusion with regard to the question of no added sugar, but in the end, I think we resolved it with a good compromise. For a short transitional period, consumers will be informed of the new rule that ordinary real juice must not contain added sugar. Then we will stop the use of this labelling, as it goes against the logic of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is normally the case that if there is a legal requirement for something, you must not highlight that property. If it is a legal requirement for there to be no added sugar, then this should not be stated on the packaging. I can accept it for a transitional period, however. Together with the Commission, we have also decided that it should not be permitted to start stating ‘no added sugar’ when the product contains sweetener.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the end, then, we achieved a result that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are able to support. I would like to thank everyone for the many long negotiations. We also had very interesting discussions and, in the end, we achieved a result that we can present to consumers. They will then be able to buy juice and know what they are getting – if they want to choose cheap artificial juice, they will know every time that it is cheap artificial juice, and if they want to choose real juice, they will know that that is what they are getting. That is what is important.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I support this directive on behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. I, too, wish to congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission, and also the Polish Presidency, who steered this difficult work to a successful conclusion. We should be glad that we are taking a significant step towards improving the quality of foods – juices are an important element of the food available – and that we are improving their quality while introducing more stringent requirements as regards information for consumers. These are all steps in the right direction. The European Union does a great deal in this field, but perhaps it should do even more. We should strive, by all means available, to ensure that food is of the highest quality and, above all, that the consumer obtains accurate and reliable information about food.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The directive achieves these objectives. It was not easy, because – as our colleagues have explained – conflicting interests had to be reconciled. The search for a compromise was long and hard, but the fruit of this work should be a cause for satisfaction. My group will, of course, vote in favour of the directive.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this new regulation seeks to avoid consumers becoming confused when purchasing fruit-based products.</p>
      <p sl="it">Fruit juice can be defined as such only if it contains 100% fruit juice, with no additives, including sugar or anything else. Fruit nectar, on the other hand, can include sweeteners, sugar or honey up to 20% of the product weight, and the quantity included must, in any case, be indicated on the label. When a product is made from several fruits, this must be mentioned in the list of ingredients, unless all ingredients are mentioned individually.</p>
      <p sl="it">To avoid confusion, there will be a transitional period of four and a half years in which fruit juice can continue to be labelled with the term ‘without added sugar’.</p>
      <p sl="it">With reference to the previous speech by Mr Schlyter, I have also often referred to the Commission the sale of fruit juices which are deliberately misleading, such as those products which cover the entire packaging with the image of a certain fruit, and then reveal in tiny writing on the back that the fruit is only a minor ingredient.</p>
      <p sl="it">The most recent case referred to the Commission, which involves a well-known brand from the same country indicated by Mr Schlyter, has packaging which shows the consumer an image of a waterfall of blueberries with the words ‘100% fruit smoothie’. On the back, in tiny lettering, the label states that the product contains only 8% blueberry juice and 40% apple juice.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to stress that – considering that 85% of orange juice is made from fruit grown outside the EU – in the interests of providing full information to consumers, this would have been a good opportunity to establish the obligation for the indication of origin on the label, but unfortunately even this was not possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">In any case, our vote, despite the few criticisms we have, will be in favour, particularly considering that the long negotiations have created a text on which there is broad agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to build on what the previous speakers, Mr Schlyter and Mr Rossi, have had to say. We criticised the fact that these packs list some fruits not contained in the product. This proposal in its current form will not change this. The positive thing about this proposal is that it will no longer be permissible to add sugar to fruit juices. That is the good news. I do not want to restate Ms Ayuso’s criticisms.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, the fact is, however, that you speak of better consumer information. How can it be considered better consumer information when the pack does not indicate that the poorer quality of the oranges used has been improved by adding favours from other sources? That was not permitted in the past. Hitherto, only good quality fruit could be used, taking flavourings from the same batch and adding it back again. This was a principle of quality. We are now about to abandon this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The second issue here is the addition of sugar. We have a labelling directive and it states that if it is printed on the packaging, it must be in the product. We are now going to confuse the consumer by stating ‘no added sugar’ on the pack. As this has been left off packaging for five years, the consumer will now believe that products contain sugar again. There is obviously a lack of clarity in the legislation you propose.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point relates to the procedure followed. I would like to address my fellow Members here. When only nine of the 31 amendments tabled in the Committee on the Environment are included in this so-called compromise, and four of these are technical measures, then we have nothing to thank the committee for. The text contains none of the committee’s proposals. The wishes of the Council and Commission have clearly been implemented in this instance, which is something that has greatly displeased us. Let me be quite honest with you. I intend to vote against this compromise because it is a poor solution, because it reduces the quality of products, and because it marginalises the procedure and Parliament itself. I cannot be a part of that. We should stop and think carefully about how we deal with a matter like this in future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We could have had the first and second readings, but there is no need for a hasty decision. After all, our sole remit is to make decisions all day long. The document before us now is a bad piece of work.</p>

But as to the issue of which fruits are on the package and what the name of the fruit juice is, that is actually solved in this text; the name shall correspond to the dominant fruit, as in the ingredients list. So, if the highest concentration is apple, it will say apple, raspberry, blueberry in that order. So that is actually a change that we won; that point is actually changed.</p>

That is the situation we already have, after all. Perhaps we should remind ourselves of what we actually agreed at the time. The Labelling Directive requires that ingredients should be listed in the order of their proportions. Suddenly, we are going to drop this idea and do something quite different. This is a problem I constantly encounter with European legislation – we simply forget what we have already decided. We are then surprised to find that consumers do not accept this and are angered by European regulations.</p>

For a while, I was concerned that we would abandon the principle that we follow when it comes to labelling of food, namely, that it is prohibited to intimate that other products within the same product group contain substances that they do not. This did not happen, and I would like to thank the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs in particular for that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr Schnellhardt made a very good point with regard to follow up. I would like to make a plea to the Commission in this regard: it is, in fact, up to you to follow up on this and ensure that the legislation that we will adopt tomorrow is actually complied with on the market. In this regard, I think that you can be a lot tougher with the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Fruit Juice Directive is particularly important as its aim is not only to provide more detailed and more precise product information for consumers, thereby protecting their health, but also to guarantee the high quality of the specified products which are sold on the European common market.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The amendments to the directive will provide the necessary safety for consumers and result in the development of an ever-increasing number of products made according to healthier recipes and with a healthier content. These new rules will strengthen the innovations and competition in one of the most highly developed industries in the European Union – the food and drink industry.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to support Andres Rodriguez’s report, featuring an example of legislation which not only affords consumer protection, but also encourages good practices in food production.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, is it not the case that this European House is completely detached from reality sometimes? In my view, this piece of legislation, this compromise, as it has been styled, on fruit juice, is an example of that. I will tell you what the reality is.</p>
      <p sl="nl">After work, the average European rushes into their local supermarket, five minutes before closing time, with two tired children in tow, and is then confronted with a whole wall of fruit juices and fruit drinks, including so-called ‘fruit nectar’. I have asked a number of shoppers what the word ‘nectar’ makes them think of. It makes them think of all sorts of things, from bees to natural products. However, the last thing it suggests to them is that sugar might have been added to this so-called natural product. That is a fact. This average European is not going to read the small print when they have two crying children sitting in their trolley. That is not something they are going to have the time to do.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I, therefore, found the original Commission proposal more than justified. It contained a provision to the effect that any sugar being added to those fruit juices, or nectars, should be explicitly and clearly stated on the packaging. However, that proposal has been scrapped in its entirety. We no longer explicitly state on labels when sugar has been added to products, while at the same time, we do state, on fruit juices where the addition of sugar is prohibited, that no sugar has been added. That is turning the world on its head, surely! We state ingredients that are not there on labels while failing to state ingredients that actually are .</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am astonished that the Commission is now defending this, because, when its proposal came out, it issued a lovely-sounding press release in which it said that we were going to get better at informing consumers when sugar had been added. Now it seems that the reality is very different. First, they make a big song and dance about it and, now, they are agreeing to this half-baked compromise.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am also astonished that members from the leftist groups, who are always the first to rush to the fore when it comes to providing better information to customers, are actually perpetuating customer confusion about this. Despite the fact that I am, sadly, going to be in the minority, I am going to vote against this compromise tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am one of Ms de Lange’s fellow Members on the left and, as a member of both the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of this Parliament and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I support this compromise, which was reached on 18 November 2011 by the rapporteur, Mr Perello Rodriguez, the Polish Presidency and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to consumer protection, I welcome the measures that have been taken in order to protect consumer interests by supplying them with as much information as possible, by ensuring unambiguous labelling of fruit juice, and in enabling them to distinguish between the different types of product sold on the market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is essential that, even if they are not featured in the name of the product, all fruits used must be indicated in the ingredients list in descending order of volume – Mr Schlyter has clearly demonstrated this. As regards the addition of sugar, this should be clearly indicated in the list of ingredients and the maximum quantity of added sugar should be specified.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore – and this was the purpose of my amendment – in order to help consumers differentiate between juice and nectar in terms of their sugar content, the phrase ‘with no added sugar’ shall be allowed and will be reviewed five years after the entry into force of the directive.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, it is quite clearly in the interests of consumers when purchasing drinks to be able to tell whether they are purchasing genuine fruit juice or just a drink made from a concentrate – a so-called nectar. This is clearly about tightening up the directive, and it is a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I nevertheless followed with concern proposals to introduce a new requirement to label nectars with the terms ‘sweetened’ or ‘with added sugar’, followed by an indication of the maximum quantity of sugar added, calculated as dry matter and expressed in grams per litre. Such a change would greatly confuse consumers, and would obviously have a negative impact on producers. Nectars would become the only category of non-alcoholic drinks subject to a mandatory statement of the quantity of added sugar, which would put these products at a significant disadvantage compared to other drinks. I am therefore pleased that common sense has prevailed, and that the proposal did not go through.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The citizens of the Czech Republic will also surely be pleased that, despite the euro crisis, European institutions have managed to solve a key long-term dispute as to whether tomatoes are a vegetable or a fruit. This European directive has established once and for all that tomatoes are the same as guava fruit. I nonetheless have doubts over Amendment 22, under which carrots are considered a fruit. I am afraid I will not be able to convince Czech gardeners on that score.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, on several occasions, the European Parliament has expressed the opinion that information plays a very important role in ensuring that the foodstuffs consumed by consumers are safe. Only by receiving full, non-deceptive information about products used will consumers be able to make a proper choice. This year, we have taken a step in this direction by approving the regulation on the provision of food information to consumers, and now we are going further by setting additional requirements for specific categories of foodstuffs. Drinks going by the name of fruit juices can often be found in the shops today. However, it is often unclear what fruit they are made of, how much sugar or sugar substitutes they contain, or whether they are juices at all or a drink produced from certain other substances. The document we are discussing today is another step towards clarity in terms of establishing what can be called fruit juices. It is very important for all juices that are marketed in the European Union to be subject to the same requirements. Exceptions should not therefore be made for juices imported into the European Union. The European Union is a big enough market for producers to be able to adapt to the requirements we have introduced.</p>
      <p sl="lt">When we vote tomorrow, we can adopt this directive at first reading. It is important to bear in mind how lengthy the procedure would otherwise be. Although I am somewhat disappointed that the text negotiated at the trialogue does not reflect all of the amendments adopted by the committee, I nevertheless feel that in this instance, the agreement of all parties is more important as I believe that this will contribute to legal certainty and the protection of consumers.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I am sorry that Ms de Lange has left. I do hope that her colleagues in the Group of the European People’s Party will not stand up to defend the nonsense she said. After all, there is no such thing as popular, liberal or socialist fruit juice. There is either high-quality fruit juice or low-quality fruit juice. For this reason, I fully endorse the tabled proposal. Already a couple of months ago, when we were debating the directive on the labelling of foodstuffs, I stressed that regulation should, first and foremost, serve the interests of consumers. In the case of fruit juices, it is particularly important to eliminate means by which consumers can be mislead. It is a shame that Ms de Lange is not aware of this. Common belief holds that these products are all of natural origin and are healthy, but it is not so!</p>
      <p sl="hu">Consumers are very often misled. Currently, there can be several markings on the packaging of fruit juices that can be misleading to consumers. The directive rightly aims to eliminate such practices. I agree with the prohibition on producers depicting fruit varieties not actually included in the fruit juice on the package. I also endorse the mandatory requirement to clearly indicate if a fruit juice was produced from concentrates, and to prohibit reference to such products as fresh fruit juice. It is important to indicate if a fruit juice contains artificial flavour enhancers. We must also make a clear distinction between fruit juices and fruit nectars, the latter being produced from concentrates or powders and having a high sugar content. All these requirements are in the interest of consumers and I therefore agree with the proposal and the directive.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, I am delighted to say a few words on this interesting topic.</p>
      <p sl="ga">One of the great delights of being a Member of the European Parliament is that you can buy freshly pressed orange juice from machines both in Brussels and in Strasbourg. The one question I have though is: why is the price in Strasbourg almost twice the price you pay in the Parliament in Brussels? However, having said that, I also feel that there is a market for similar machines to be made available to consumers right throughout the European Union, because there is confusion regarding fruit juices – those pressed from fresh fruit and those from concentrates.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The second point which I want to make is that I was amazed in researching this to discover that 82% of the orange juice used within the European Union is imported, mainly from Brazil and the USA. I will agree with previous speakers that this has to be addressed in the reformed CAP so that we can avail of the opportunity to grow fresh fruit, particularly oranges for orange juice, within the European Union where there is a perfect climate for it. Certainly, that is an opportunity that we should not miss. It would improve fresh fruit and it would also lead to a reduction in the carbon footprint and CO2 emissions.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Labelling is absolutely vital; we have to give the best information possible to consumers, particularly in relation to added sugar. An awful lot of consumers at this point in time do not make the distinction. I think there is not just a need for what we are doing here this evening; there is also a need for an educational process. People are hungry and thirsty to get this information and, if they have it, they will act on it. This is a good move and I welcome it.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Perello Rodriguez, for the good work he has done. I would like to draw attention to a few points I feel are important.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Firstly, I think that one of the basic obligations that we all have is to make the necessary efforts to stimulate European production. In actual fact, some European Union Member States have the potential and facilities to meet a large part of the fruit juice consumption on the European market, and we must support this sector.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The positive impact of this can be viewed in a number of respects. There are benefits for the environment by ensuring that all the fruit is picked, which means that we avoid destroying produce unsuitable for direct sale or leaving it unpicked in the countryside, which causes the proliferation of pests. There are also socio-economic benefits because it generates added value for creating jobs and incomes for producers.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The second point which I would like to emphasise concerns the use of the words ‘with no added sugar’. I think that they are extremely important for consumers, especially for the different risk groups and children, since nowadays, the consumption of fruit juice is part of a healthy human diet and can be a factor in a balanced lifestyle.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I think that the compromises that have been reached are sufficiently clear and appropriate for differentiating between the individual types of drinks and their content, and will contribute to changing consumer habits, with the aim of achieving and supporting a good state of health.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Last but not least, I think that it is important that we do not lose sight of the balance between protecting consumer interests and those of European producers. Consumers are entitled to know exactly what they are consuming, but this does not need to lead to rules being imposed which will hurt European producers. This is a very important condition for small and medium-sized enterprises as they are far more sensitive to any legislative amendment.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally, I think that we need to adopt the compromise version, even though it does not contain all our initial proposals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a very rare thing for all sides of the House to be completely satisfied with anything. I believe, however, that this compromise is a very good one for the consumer because it establishes freedom in decision making. This is something that we always wanted to achieve with food labelling. We are not looking to nanny anyone. We do not want to tell people what foods to buy or what drinks, whether a fruit nectar or a fruit juice. What we do want, however, is to provide the basis to enable consumers to make their decision based on reliable information. The compromise before us today establishes this freedom.</p>
      <p sl="de">Something we definitely need to do in parallel with this legislation is to run an information campaign. We need to educate people. This principle, health literacy, is one that we must bring to life. If people assume that a fruit juice with nothing on the pack to indicate that no sugar has been added actually contains no sugar, this means that they do not know enough. After all, a fruit juice must, by its nature, contain sugar. Not all consumers are aware of this and I believe that we – the European Parliament and the European institutions – really need to catch up in this regard. We need to empower people to make such decisions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the quality, non-defectiveness and natural properties of food products are, from the point of view of our citizens, one of the most important areas for supervision by the bodies of the Union, an area which affects their daily lives. The fact that Council Directive 2001/112/EC is being amended for a second time means that, to ensure the necessary quality of fruit juices and similar products, it is necessary to respond to changes in production technology and the development of knowledge regarding the quality of this production. Producers frequently take advantage of loopholes in the rules and often offer consumers fruit drinks which do not contain the ingredients as declared on the label. More precise rules for the labelling of packages with regard to the actual composition of fruit drinks, as well as the fact that it will no longer be possible to add sugar to drinks labelled as fruit juice, will allow consumers to better distinguish the goods offered and to make a more informed choice from a wide range. We therefore expect broad support for the adoption of this directive.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I believe that everyone present in this room agrees with the basic directive of the report. However, the magical number was pronounced by Mr Kelly: 82% of the orange juice used within the European Union is imported. And in order for us to be able to take steps in line with the directive and reach a healthy, normal ratio, we will, on the one hand, need to increase fruit production in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="hu">On the other hand, we need to increase the percentage of fruit juice produced from European fruits among fruit juices available for purchase in the European Union. It is extremely ambivalent to be discussing this while in Central and Eastern Europe, vast fruit plantations are being cut down by orders or instructions of the European Union. In Hungary, for instance, it is the European Union that forces farmers to cut down fruit plantations. Yet, if the European Union were to spend only a fragment of the amounts it spends on African countries on the replanting of fruit plantations and the revitalisation of the processing industry, there would by now be prosperity in all of Eastern Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first and foremost, this debate has demonstrated how a seemingly simple product like fruit juice can rouse such passions. As several of you have mentioned, this shows that the fruit and vegetable sector is of real value to us, that it is also seen in a positive light in terms of our health, and that we therefore have an interest in protecting and supporting this sector, as we have been doing through the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the best ways to support the fruit production sector is to gain and maintain consumer confidence. Following the Escherichia coli crisis this year, we saw how a lack of confidence among consumers could have a negative impact on producers. That is why I think that this directive, which we negotiated jointly and, I agree, is a good compromise, helps to strengthen consumer confidence as well as being beneficial for producers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to reassure Mr Schnellhardt, if that may help him to change his mind and to vote in favour of this directive, that this directive is fully consistent with the Labelling Directive because all the ingredients will be indicated on the label and in the name of the product, in the order of the quantities contained in the juice in question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore as you can see, it does not clash with the Labelling Directive, which indeed requires all ingredients to be listed, except that they must be listed in descending order of percentage content.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Szegedi, I do not know what led you to think that the European Union forces Hungarian producers or any other European producers to uproot their trees. This has never been the case for any product and nothing forces a producer to make such a choice. I can assure you that there is nothing in the common agricultural policy or in any European decision that forces any European fruit producer to uproot their trees. Therefore, you need not be concerned, as fruit and vegetable producers will continue to receive support that will allow them to grow quality produce.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The decision, which I hope we are going to make, will help consumers to appreciate this quality. Some of you have raised the fact that a large quantity of juice is imported from outside of the European Union. What is important in the European Union is that we continue to ensure that the juices and fruits we produce succeed not so much in terms of quantity but of quality, because that is where added value lies. I think that it is important to support this, especially as we have a limited potential area for agricultural land, in any case, more limited than that of other producers around the world.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The way in which to help our producers to successfully earn a living is, above all, by helping them to grow quality produce and to realise its potential. I think that this directive will also help us to make a step in this direction.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to express my thanks, once again, to Mr Perello Rodriguez, and to thank all those who have worked on reaching this compromise and on moving towards a positive decision tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, thank you to the Presidency of the Council and the Commission and thank you to everyone involved.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, I would be lacking in sincerity if I did not add something else. Each of us in Parliament is free to speak up for whatever interests we deem fit, be they those of an industrial sector or any other of our choosing. However, I believe we must be honest with ourselves and with others, and not conceal our defence of whatever it is we are defending by disguising it behind other names or issues.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have to say that not one of the shadow rapporteurs, who have worked hard on this and some of whom, like Mr Schlyter, have even added some hints of humour, which we really needed, have received any complaints from any consumers’ association.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason, nobody here can say that we are not providing consumers with information and nobody can try to claim that they speak for consumers’ interests more than the consumers’ associations themselves do. This is not our intention. You should read this directive again in depth and pay respect to the work done.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to say a few words about three speeches, those by Ms Ries, Mr Kelly and Ms Nedelcheva, which mentioned the need to promote and consume local products. The truth is that the European Union, virtually regardless of the country of production, is a powerful consumer and producer of fruit and packaged juices. We should encourage consumption of our own products as far as possible, in order to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions and promote European products at a time of crisis, particularly in agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why I support the three speeches that raised this issue, and add my voice to them. I also accept and support the Commissioner’s comments about working harder to improve both quality and quantity. We must do this, but the Union is a single entity and the place in which an item is produced is irrelevant. This must also be reflected in our fruits and juices.</p>

This new arrangement allows for something previously impossible, namely, that flavours can be added to a fruit juice from other fruits or a different batch, perhaps leading one to assume that the juice was produced from less sweet fruits.

      <p sl="es">What we could not accept is something that is technically impossible, which is to compulsorily add to the juice – to help goodness knows who – the flavour of the very fruit being pressed. This is technically impossible when the juice is stored in four-million-litre tanks and you need 10 000 litres to get two litres of flavour, and this should have been made clear.

      <p sl="pl">There is still a lot of confusion in the fruit juice market. When choosing juices, consumers are not entirely sure whether the juices are made from squeezed fruit or from concentrates. Another incorrectly interpreted term is the word ‘nectar’, the definition of which, as the rapporteur underlines, is not agreed even among manufacturers. Information about sugar content is absolutely necessary, particularly for persons with health problems. Uniformity of terminology and clear consumer information about products are the top priority. Another issue to be borne in mind is that increased consumption of locally produced juices should be encouraged. Over 80% of consumption in Europe consists of juices imported from across the Atlantic. Obviously, our citrus fruits are not as beautiful and ripe as Brazilian ones, but they are ideal for juice production. If we want to ensure food security in the EU and protect the environment by reducing CO2 emissions from transport, we should strongly support the European fruit juice market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Consumer associations inform us that the majority of people interviewed do not really understand the difference between a ‘fruit juice’ and a fruit ‘nectar’, between a ‘juice with no added sugars’ and a ‘natural fruit juice’. We believe that more needs to be done to clarify the situation to allow for free and informed choices. For example, a mixture of 90% apple juice and 10% strawberry juice will have to be labelled as ‘apple and strawberry juice’, whilst currently, the label is allowed to state ‘strawberry juice’. A generic name such as ‘juice mixture’ can be used if the product is manufactured from three or more fruits. This is the direction taken by the resolution which was voted on today, making the consumer the focus of the legislator’s attention. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to which I belong also considers as equal the demands of producers: until now, European producers have been treated differently compared with their colleagues in third countries (the US and China, for example), who have imported fruit juices into the EU which have occasionally not undergone the strict controls to which European producers were subject. Today, we have guaranteed that this discrimination will stop, by imposing the same obligations on importers from third countries and ensuring that consumers can freely choose what product to buy on the basis of its quality.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, actually there is a connection, because if you have a party and drink lots of fruit juices, then you have to do the cleaning up afterwards. So I think there is a direct logical link. That was a debate about helping consumers; this is about saving the world. So it is a very important debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission proposal is to remove phosphates from the detergents which we put into domestic washing machines: not controversial; all Member States appear to agree, and the Commission produced a very good draft regulation. Why we want to take out phosphates, I should add, is because, although they act as abrasives within the washing process and help to eliminate the dirt, when they are discharged into water, they cause eutrophication, which leads to the growth of green algae that spreads across lakes and waters and seas, depriving wildlife of oxygen. So we need to remove them; everybody agrees on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">It came to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and we discussed it and thought it was a good step forward – thank you, Commission, for the proposal – but why not throw in dishwashers as well, as they also use phosphates in their detergents? The committee voted by 48 to 8 to include dishwashers, and we thought: good, we are improving the situation for everybody. But there was a small problem. The Council was taken by surprise by this change and did not agree. Here, I would like just to say a warm word of thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs and the other members of the committee who helped, the committee secretariat and my own assistant – they did a fantastic job working on this and presenting a united front.</p>
      <p sl="en">So we talked closely to the Polish Presidency, who were also magnificent in their enthusiasm and cooperative spirit. They said that they did not have a majority in the Council so this was very difficult, and so on. The big moment of change – the turning point – came when Denmark had a national election, and the reluctant government of the right – which had been resisting dishwashers – changed to a new government. The new Danish Environment Minister is a Green and immediately sent a signal saying that he was reversing Danish policy. Suddenly, there was a chink of light in the Council position, and Member States started to move towards Parliament’s position, which was extremely pleasing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I asked to see my own minister in the Member State I know best. He said he had absolutely no time at all to see me. I tried again: same refusal. The third time, I was told I could have half an hour in about six weeks’ time. I finally got to see him and was told it was completely impossible to agree to this, so I retreated, dismayed and disappointed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Meanwhile, keeping in touch with the Polish Presidency, we found things were moving very satisfactorily towards a majority in the Council, so we embarked on an informal first reading conciliation to try and explore whether we could find grounds for agreement on a single first reading. The Council worked very hard and we reached a final document – which is pretty much the document in front of you here – which recommends that both washing machine and dishwasher detergents be included.</p>
      <p sl="en">We then waited with trepidation to see what Coreper would actually make of this document we had negotiated and, to our enormous pleasure, the message came back a few weeks ago that Coreper had agreed to Parliament’s position by 25 Member States to 2. To my amazement – and yours, Mr President – our coalition government changed its position (but without telling me), meaning that it was no longer against the proposal. So this was a happy situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Colleagues, I want to recommend the position that we have got from Parliament. It is a very good proposal and I hope that everybody can vote for this tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Newton Dunn for the report. I will support it with my vote. However, I have a question that pertains to the fact that this report currently concerns the reduction of the phosphate content of laundry detergents. When will there be a strategy that also covers, say, fertilisers, where we reduce the phosphate content of those, too? After all, the report does refer to fertilisers, but does not include them among substances that present a danger to waters. Now, in many cases, they do endanger water reserves, that is, groundwater reserves. So will there be such a strategy, and if yes, when will it be drafted?</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, that was a very good question. In fact, this proposal, if approved, will reduce only a small amount of the phosphates that go into our waters. As you probably know, the largest proportion comes from the human body – partly from foods and drinks that we take in and then let out again. So this is a proposal that I hope the Commission will make; perhaps the Commissioner will address this point about how we can reduce other inputs of phosphates, including fertilisers. Let us see if the Commissioner answers the honourable Member’s question.</p>

    <intervention id="2-591-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Mr Newton Dunn for all the effort he has put in – together with the Hungarian and Polish Presidencies and all the shadow rapporteurs – on this work which affects all of our daily lives. These are some of the most important issues which a legislator must oversee in the best way possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">As Mr Newton Dunn has already mentioned, this regulation aims at amending a regulation from 2004, the so-called detergent regulation, with the aim of harmonising the phosphate content in laundry detergents and household automatic dishwasher detergents across the European Union. That is why I used the phrase ‘daily life’.</p>
      <p sl="it">Following the limitations outlined in the regulation, expenditure on phosphate removal from waste water treatment plants will fall, since the chemicals needed to remove phosphates will be required in smaller quantities. Furthermore, the EU will improve surface water quality in regions where tertiary treatment in waste water treatment plants is not, or is not yet, in place.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am very pleased that Parliament and the Council support the Commission’s proposal to limit the phosphate content in household laundry detergents and I warmly welcome the amendment which will see the content expressed in ‘grams per standard washing dose’, since this will be an incentive to innovation and to more compact formulas being produced.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament and the Council have also decided now to include limitations on the maximum phosphate content in household automatic dishwasher detergents to come into force from 1 January 2017. The Commission will present a report to examine whether the maximum content and the date of entry into force of the regulations regarding detergents for dishwashers are technically and economically achievable for all operators in the European Union without having negative repercussions for consumers or for the environment. On the basis of this report, and if deemed necessary, the Commission will be in a position to present a new proposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">In a spirit of compromise and with the aim of allowing the adoption of the regulation at first reading, the Commission may accept the compromise text, although it does contain some content which moves some way from the original proposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, the Commission regrets the fact that by now including maximum content limits for household automatic dishwasher detergents, the principles which encourage ‘better regulation’ and ‘evidence-based policy making’ have not been followed. Given this, we thought it was best to release a statement to this effect.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, the Commission can also accept all the compromise amendments and is happy that, thanks to the cooperative attitude of both institutions – Parliament and the Council – it has been possible to achieve an agreement at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I would just like to enter the debate which followed Mr Newton Dunn’s speech to confirm that the Commission’s proposal on fertilisers is planned for 2012 and that phosphates will not be the only or the main issue addressed in the proposal. An impact assessment is currently under way and will soon reach its conclusion.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO Committee) on this subject, I have been intent on finding a balance between the needs of all the concerned parties. I, of course, am referring to consumers and the environment, but also to the requirements of industries linked to the various detergents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The compromise that the rapporteur, Mr Newton Dunn, has achieved strikes this balance. Indeed, it was essential to postpone the phosphates limit for dishwasher detergents, as how could the removal of all phosphates be beneficial when it would cause people to have to run the dishwasher twice or even increase the water temperature? Excessive consumption or overheating of water is bad for the environment and for the consumer’s wallet; therefore, we must wait until we have found effective alternatives to phosphates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, it is regrettable that the IMCO Committee’s opinions on the greenwashing ban and on labelling promoting the sustainable use of detergents have not been taken into account. It would have been beneficial to further raise consumer awareness with regard to the sustainable use of detergents in daily life, because there are still too many bad habits causing environmental damage.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water and phosphates form a close bond. I would like to begin with water: water, in both the literal and figurative sense, is an elixir of life for us. In the European Water Framework Directive and its related directives, we have created an instrument that can ensure good quality in our waters throughout Europe. Phosphate is also a central component of life without which nothing can exist in this world. It is a finite resource, however, and high-quality sources of phosphate are beginning to dry up.</p>
      <p sl="de">The amendment of the detergents regulation and the ban on phosphates in household cleaning agents now achieves two targets. We are reducing consumption of this valuable resource, while at the same time preventing eutrophication in our waters. Water does not recognise borders. Water quality and water hardness do vary greatly in the different Member States, however, and, as a result, our measures must be variable too.</p>
      <p sl="de">For example, there is a major phosphate problem in the Baltic Sea and in the Danube. Other countries have phosphate levels well under control thanks to good sewage treatment plants. Phosphate is filtered out and treated for reuse. Nonetheless, the old principle still applies: prevention is better than cure. Thus, if we can do without phosphates in detergents, we should do so. In my own country, Germany, there have been no phosphates in detergents for the last twenty years. This proves that phosphates are not essential.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a particular need for action in switching to phosphate-free detergents in countries with a poorly developed water treatment infrastructure, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe. For this reason, I welcome the fact that we will be able to impose an EU-wide ban on phosphates in detergents, starting in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="de">Acting on an initiative from Parliament, the Council now also accepts Parliament’s call for a ban on phosphates in dishwasher detergents from 2017 onwards. This blanket ban increases the pressure on businesses to innovate and will oblige them to develop good, phosphate-free dishwasher detergents. There are already good alternatives available which are marketed in several Member States with soft water. Thus, the new regulation also allows Member States to introduce a ban earlier than 2017. In comparison with other impact sources, such as human waste, the impact from dishwasher detergent is very low. In the interests of a sustainable economy, however, we must avoid the use of phosphates wherever possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Newton Dunn, for his excellent work, to the Polish Presidency for its commitment to seeing this issue through, and, of course, to the Commission for the good model provided. We have achieved a good result and can conclude the first reading with a clear conscience.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I am pleased that some of us decided to improve the European Commission’s proposal regarding the limited use of phosphorus compounds in detergents so that it also includes dishwasher detergents. We managed to get this through, even in the face of all those who did not believe that we would.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Some countries, including my own, have already gone ahead and introduced what, in practice, amounts to a ban on phosphates in both laundry detergents and dishwasher detergents. This is working extremely well. The rest of the EU is now following suit, and this of course will make an important contribution to reducing eutrophication in the Baltic Sea, for example. However, other water bodies and environments within the EU will also benefit from this legislation, as will the industry, which will have one common piece of legislation to follow instead of 27 different ones.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our group would have preferred the levels to have been even lower and the entry into force to have been sooner, but we view the compromise that we have agreed with the Council as a major success. This legislation is a simple and effective contribution to reducing eutrophication. However, as has already been mentioned here this evening, the biggest contribution to eutrophication comes, of course, from agriculture. We definitely need to take more measures in this area. There are ways of reducing emissions, even from agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Finally, I would, naturally, like to thank everyone involved, particularly the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, for their excellent work.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, from 1 January 2017, phosphates will therefore be excluded from dishwasher detergents. These measures, which have been long awaited by many professionals and NGOs, will help to reinforce the legislative arsenal of those Member States who have already banned these powerful cleaning agents. Phosphates, which we know are very effective as water softeners, are also pollutants that disrupt the aquatic balance, thus contributing to the eutrophication of European waters.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to give a heartfelt thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Newton Dunn, who wisely and intelligently, alongside the Polish Presidency and the Commission, was able to successfully argue that this regulation could legitimately be extended to include dishwasher detergents.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I have two reservations with regard to this agreement that will cause me to abstain from the vote tomorrow. Please note that these views are my own and not those of my group. These two reservations seem to me to be symptomatic of the state of the spirit of Europe today. The first is that, in my opinion, this agreement does not sufficiently take into account the small and medium-sized enterprises who manufacture phosphates in particular. For example, not far from my home, near Liège, the company Prayon, which creates 780 direct jobs, is rightly concerned about the negative impact of this legislation on its business. This demonstrates that the tenet ‘think small first’ is sometimes difficult to put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second reservation, which has already been raised and is clearly logical, is that as 90% of the eutrophication of our waters comes from sources other than dishwasher detergents, this pollution will continue with or without them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to kick-start Europe: we should not legislate solely on minor issues as we have done here, but on the heart of the matter. It is clear that we must strive for an improved implementation of the directive on waste water treatment, but we must also work to tackle intensive farming and the improper disposal of food waste – the true culprits responsible for the deterioration of European waters.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the Baltic Sea is grateful for this decision – it is Europe’s most sensitive sea. It is precisely the lack of phosphorus that stems algal growth and the addition of phosphorus to the Baltic Sea is particularly damaging – more so than in other seas. I would like to thank Mr Newton Dunn and the other shadow rapporteurs. Without you, we would never have succeeded in convincing the Council that we needed to take a decision to ban dishwasher detergents, too.</p>
      <p sl="sv">As many people are saying, the biggest problem is manure and non-mains waste water outlets, in other words, waste water outlets that are not connected to an operational treatment plant. However, this is a significant contribution, and we have also agreed that the Commission shall carry out a review of the use of phosphates as a whole. This is excellent. I would actually have liked us perhaps to have introduced this a little earlier, but the most important thing is that it will happen and it will be applied by the whole of the industry. I am certain that it will switch over much earlier than the date we have set here. In my country, we have already banned both dishwasher detergents and laundry detergents.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would like to say at this point that this shows that we should have a little flexibility in the internal market. The fact that one country can go ahead and take measures has been very important in this very debate. It is thanks to this that we have been able to demonstrate that it is not expensive to phase out phosphates. On the contrary, it is extremely beneficial, and when people have seen that it works in practice, it is much easier for the whole of Europe to follow suit. I therefore think it is good that countries that want to introduce bans earlier than the date laid down in the legislation have the opportunity to do so.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Then there is the problem of the review of the alternatives. In this regard, we refer to REACH for its implementation. However, I would like to ask the Commission: as REACH has not been used once to prohibit a chemical, will you therefore use it here? If we have identified an alternative that is and should be prohibited, will you use REACH in earnest in order to prohibit it?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Up to now, REACH has only been used to adjust earlier bans, not to introduce new ones. That is something I would like to have an answer to and I await with interest the assessment of phosphate use. I also await with interest the initiative to prohibit industrial applications, too.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation aims to reduce the maximum phosphate content in detergents to 0.5% in weight from 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the moment, that limit will only apply to domestic laundry detergents; the extension to household dishwasher detergents will be evaluated by the end of 2014. This is important because, as has already been stated by the Commissioner, this inclusion will only take place when technically and economically viable alternatives are available, which do not exist or are not easily available today.</p>
      <p sl="it">Choosing to make this addition allows us to vote in favour because in fact – if the original approach proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) had been maintained – it would simply have encouraged the consumer to use twice the recommended dose of detergent in the dishwasher, and so absolutely nothing would have changed for the environment and the consumer would have spent twice the amount to clean their dishes in the same way as before.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the Commission with regard to the inclusion of dishwasher detergents and industrial-use detergents. The Council has also agreed to extend the regulation of dishwasher detergents to a maximum of 0.3 grams from 2017, unless further amendments are made, and to a maximum of 0.5 grams for laundry detergents from 30 June 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe the final test is therefore an excellent agreement, proper and discreet in terms of its affect on businesses, the consumer and the environment, and so our vote will certainly be in favour.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission, the rapporteur and our shadow rapporteurs because I believe that we have reached an excellent compromise. It is very pragmatic. I feel it worth pointing out that, in the Water Framework Directive, we have produced a piece of legislation that will define our century, with the aim of bringing European waters to good ecological status by 2015. Of course, sector-targeted measures will also be required. It is also worth pointing out that we already have directives on drinking water and nitrates, as well as the EOS system, which will be the subject of a proposal for expansion from the Commission this year, and we are now taking a new direction with this directive containing limits for phosphates in dishwashers and detergents.</p>
      <p sl="de">The situation varies in the different Member States. In some Member States, agriculture is the main polluter, while in others, the problem lies with industrial and municipal waste water, depending on water hardness, which is mainly dependent on topographical and other geological factors, as well as the development of sewerage systems and sewage treatment plants in the Member State in question. Nonetheless, the Commission has chosen the right approach in getting to the root of this problem. There is wide divergence in proportions. In some Member States, detergents only account for a couple of per cent, but in others, they account for much more.</p>
      <p sl="de">We now have a compromise that is welcomed by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), particularly because we have also included dishwasher detergents. I believe that we are on the right path to meet our long-term goal of achieving high water quality. We expect that the Commission will continue with this approach, tackling in particular these various sources of pollution which are the main cause of most water problems, as in the agricultural and industrial sectors. We look forward to receiving proposals in this regard next year as well.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my thanks to my colleague, Bill Newton Dunn, for all his work, and mainly for successfully sticking to his guns throughout the entire process and defending an excellent report. The high phosphate content in detergents has a proven, highly adverse impact on marine and river ecosystems.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The phosphates and phosphorous compounds contained in detergents for dishwashers and washing machines greatly stimulate the proliferation of algae in lakes, rivers and seas, resulting in the destruction of normal animal and plant life in these environments.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Some Member States have already managed to observe the irreversible damage from the use of phosphate detergents and have started to take legal measures to avert more disastrous consequences. The European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety showed its concern by supporting the inclusion of detergents as well within the scope of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I was at the Durban conference last week and would like to share with you the fact that the battle for a cleaner planet is strongly forging ahead. Against this background, I firmly believe that the European Union must again show strong resolve and leadership at a global level, creating ever-higher standards of environmental protection, as well as developing innovations and scientific research activities.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for his perseverance because I believe it was very important that there should be no half measures here. If we had only considered washing machine detergents, then we would only have been dealing in half measures. This is because the use of dishwasher detergents has a significant impact on our water. This provision constitutes a first step in ensuring that, in the future, we will allow our waters room to breathe, rather than simply survive, so that excessively large fish and algae populations do not spell the end for this resource.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to see the Commission taking a strict and consistent line in expanding this regulation to include industrial and institutionalised detergents because I believe there is a huge need for such a move. I know that this a complex and difficult area and we naturally need to consider how economic it is. Nonetheless, I believe that this is also our main problem in relation to Durban: you cannot negotiate with nature. We do not have very much time left in this area. This is why I would like to see us taking an urgent approach here. We must not lose sight of one thing: although we have banned phosphates from detergents, substitutes have been found. For this reason, we need to take a close look at these substitutes in the future. I am very grateful that we have a regulation that permits a great deal of flexibility, requiring attention to the question of different water hardness levels and cleaning grades. This should not, however, lead to the dilution of this regulation in any way.</p>

We all want to save the planet and obviously the quality of water is of immense importance to us. From my observations in my country, the quality of water has improved immensely over the last number of years, largely due to European Union policies, especially in relation to the use of fertilisers. In this regard, I think there is a challenge here for us to come up with phosphate-free formulations for dishwashers and washing machines, both in terms of domestic use, but also industrial use.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Ms Klaß said, the quality of water varies – the hardness and the softness – right throughout the European Union. We are creating an opportunity for people to develop these products, but also creating a market by having deadlines by which they have to be introduced. I think that is a very important point.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, several EU countries have adopted measures to restrict the use of phosphates in detergents. Phosphates are synthetic substances that are found in detergents used in households, automatic washing machines and dishwashers and, once used, they end up in our water systems. Here they cause excessive growth of algae that produce toxins and kill fish and plants. The measures that have been taken by countries to restrict the use of phosphates are ineffective, however, because the washing machine and automatic dishwasher loads are covered by mutual recognition. A pragmatic way of solving this problem is to adopt regulations on the permitted amount of phosphorus in detergents used in washing machines and automatic washing machines in units by standard load. Adopting such harmonised rules would then help us to proceed in a uniform manner when dealing with third countries as well. This would protect us, the European Union, as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="ga">To that end, I wholly welcome the content of this report in relation to reducing the phosphate level in detergents and washing powders as much as possible – and eliminating them if possible in the future. As a result of these restrictions that are to be implemented across the whole of the EU, the people of Ireland and the EU will have cleaner water and the threat from vast growths of algal blooms, river weed and water weeds which choke other aquatic life, will be reduced.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The purpose of this proposal for a regulation is to reduce the amount of phosphorus used in detergents in domestic washing machines and to harmonise better the various national regulations. Phosphates end up in our water systems, rivers, streams, lakes and, particularly, in the Danube Basin and Baltic Sea. Phosphorus from household laundry detergents and automatic dishwashing machine (ADW) detergents make a significant contribution to the direct presence of phosphorus in water channels, thereby causing eutrophication. I welcome the broad acceptance that the maximum amount of phosphorus in household laundry detergents should be set at 0.5 g per dose for a standard wash load.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Expressing this limit in grams per load rather than as a percentage by weight, as initially proposed by the Commission, will allow laundry detergent manufacturers to produce more compact, concentrated formulas, which will not contain any greater amount of phosphorus than 0.5% by weight of a current ‘standard dose’, but where the phosphorus (from phosphonates) could form more than 0.5% of the total weight. Likewise, as regards the inclusion of household ADW detergents in the proposal, the limit should be set at 0.5% by weight.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to welcome the outcome of the negotiations with the Council on the use of phosphates and other phosphorous compounds in household laundry detergents. I think that these measures for limiting the phosphorus content per dose of detergent must be linked, without fail, to improving not only the treatment of waste water, but also agricultural methods, since agriculture itself is a source of phosphorus for surface water.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The proposal made by the rapporteur for us to also focus our attention on the practicality of banning phosphates and the possible consequences such a ban would have for industrial detergents is particularly welcome if we really want to clean up Europe’s water. However, we must be realistic and acknowledge that this step is not possible at the moment, either from a technical or economic perspective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, I think that there needs to be greater investment in identifying alternatives to using phosphates and other phosphorous compounds in detergents so that we can achieve the objectives of protecting the environment and public health more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I would like to point out that our efforts must not stop here and that we must promote this approach to limiting the phosphate content in detergents in non-EU countries as well.</p>
