      <p sl="en">Madam President, I will speak English. Normally, I speak Swedish in plenary, but I did all the rest of the work in English and when I tried to prepare the Swedish, I realised that some of the words would be easier – this once – in English, because I had used them during the whole process.</p>
      <p sl="en">After an extensive process in committee, the report on discharge for the Commission for the financial year 2010 has now arrived in plenary. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to both the European Court of Auditors and the European Commission for their very fruitful and professional cooperation during this process. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the opinion-giving committees for their input. Discharge is one of the main prerogatives of the European Parliament, and it is important that we all try to take part in it in one way or another.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me turn to the most important question of any discharge procedure: whether or not to grant discharge. As you can see in the report adopted in the committee, which followed my recommendation to grant discharge to the Commission for the financial year 2010, this was not an easy decision. We know that this is the 17th year that the Commission has not received a clean bill from the Court, and we can even see some small increases in error rates in certain areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reason we came to the conclusion we did is that we got adequate responses from the Commission to the four priority actions that the Commission needs to address in the upcoming months. Specifically, the following four points for action will be addressed by the Commission and I hope it will confirm this today: firstly, financial engineering instruments; secondly, the Commission’s accountability instruments; thirdly, pre-financing; and, fourthly, the Commission’s supervisory role in the cohesion area.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want action in all of these areas in exchange for discharge. The financial engineering instruments kept us busy for most of the time. The Court of Auditors found severe weaknesses in the implementation of these instruments, especially in the area of cohesion. As you all are aware, the Commission proposed using those instruments even more often in the future, which is why we invested a lot of effort in thinking about how we could correct the weaknesses detected.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is now being asked, in particular, to objectively and critically evaluate the use of those instruments and report back, and to assess the specific risks attached to the use of these instruments. Some people make it sound like these instruments are some kind of alchemy that create gold out of nothing, but we see risk and we see costs, and we want them to be evaluated so that we know exactly what consequences they will have.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second point I mentioned concerns how the Commission assumes its financial responsibility for implementing the EU budget. At the centre of that question is the annual activity report and the synthesis report. We need these to be improved and we need them to actually show more than they hide. As a result of our deliberations, the committee required that the Commission deliver a political declaration in which it accepts its final and overall responsibility for the implementation of the budget, including the part which is implemented under shared management.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need the Commission to strengthen its annual activity report and for the signature of the Commissioner responsible to be added next to that of the Director-General, to show that the Commission assumes responsibility. We also want the Commission to analyse whether the Commission’s own corporate governance arrangements could be further improved, for example, by taking on some of the obligations it lays down on others in its Green Paper on EU corporate governance.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015-000" speaker_id="39769" name="Martin EHRENHAUSER" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Austria" birth_date="18-09-1978" birth_place="Linz" p_group="Non" m_state="AT">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, first things first. In our report, we propose that the Commission should issue discharge in respect of the implementation of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds (EDFs) for 2010 and also approve the accounts. I believe that the Commission has made progress in numerous areas. I also believe that a large number of the requirements of the Court of Auditors and European Parliament have already been implemented. Nonetheless, I would like to address a number of points open to criticism.</p>
      <p sl="de">Take, for example, the question of the integration of the EDFs in the European Union budget. We threw away a major opportunity to integrate the EDFs during the discussions relating to the multiannual financial framework. The new target for 2020 is easy to understand. That is a good thing and we must work with urgency to achieve it. We should integrate the EDFs in the budget when the Cotonou Agreement lapses, at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another recurring issue is the error rates. The probable error rate of 3.4% is far too high, significantly exceeding the 2% threshold, and must be reduced. A stable error rate is not a success in my opinion. A number of measures have been implemented by the Commission. If the error rate remains stable, however, at some point one must recognise that these measures have failed and that new measures are needed.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission tells us that the residual error rate is much lower than the 2% threshold. Nonetheless, the Commission fails to offer clear indicators to show how they came up with this calculation. The Commission is already working on a key indicator. This work should be concluded by 2013 at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="de">The control and oversight systems are of only limited effectiveness. In this context, we need to address the delegations area in particular. An electronic monitoring system is to be introduced that will certainly deserve our close scrutiny. I intend suggesting to the Committee on Budgetary Control that we table an own-initiative report that will take a close look at how this monitoring system works and whether it is truly efficient and effective.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to budget support, this has been a recurring issue for 20 years and is always a highlight as part of the debate. I believe that the control options are not really working here either. There is an urgent need to consider the case for reform. I am aware that the Commission, for its part, believes that there are a great many misunderstandings among some Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control in relation to the actual conditions as they apply. The proposal put forward by the Commission at the time that another hearing should be arranged to eliminate these misunderstandings is very good. This would be a good way to move forward here.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our discharge report, we paid particular attention to the investment facility and the EIB. A number of observations need to be made, including the fact that the investment facility is not part of the statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors and is not taken into consideration. The lack of transparency among eventual recipients should also be mentioned – the fact that these recipients are not clearly accessible here is a situation that needs to be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then we come to the question of efficiency and how money is spent. The fact is that around 14% of the investment facility is managed through European institutions and joint ventures. This is a very inefficient structure in my opinion. The money chain is far too long. There are too many intermediary institutions that earn money and interest in this way. We need to try to ensure that development aid does not become an end in itself. For this reason, I suggest that the Court of Auditors should produce a special report examining the investment facility in greater detail. I would ask for your support for this and for the other proposals contained in the report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I am standing in, today, for Ms Ayala Sender, who is in Algeria as part of an electoral observers’ delegation and is thus unable to act as rapporteur for discharge of the other institutions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me start with the good news: we intend to move that the majority of the other institutions should be discharged. We had difficulty with the granting of discharge to the Economic and Social Committee because, although various requirements of the European Parliament in relation to questions of travel expenses claims and similar problems that attract a great deal of interest in the media have been met, we are somewhat concerned to find that there have been some differences of opinion within the Committee in relation to certain decisions on appointments – I trust you will understand my wish to choose my words with care here. The rapporteur has expressed her concerns in relation to this issue at Committee level and we shall continue to monitor the situation. However, this will not prevent us from requesting discharge.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of the Council, the situation is slightly different. Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction and pleasure to find that the Danish Council Presidency is doing us the honour of following this debate. This is a first in all my time as a Member of his House. This is an encouraging sign that we are moving away from the phase where the institutions simply ignored one another during debates. I will return to this point at the end of my remarks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Each year, we find ourselves in a situation reminiscent of ‘Groundhog Day’. In other words, we start the business of discharging the Council for its management of the budget, or at least for the portion that involves European Union resources – in other words, the general budget funds. We assess the documents and we ask pertinent questions. The Council never gives any answers, however.</p>
      <p sl="de">Instead, we have received an offer from the Council to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement. This is something to be welcomed from my point of view at least because I have a difficulty when I find the Secretaries-General of the two institutions negotiating with one another, despite the fact that they do not have a political mandate – please do not take this personally Mr Welle – because, in my opinion, they have failed to pay enough attention to the aspirations, wishes and positions of the responsible Committee.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thus, we have a proposal for an interinstitutional agreement on the table and the position of my group in this House is that we should put the opportunities offered by this interinstitutional agreement to the test. Unfortunately we are in the minority here, because most of my fellow Members believe that the documents describe the functions adequately.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I would like to emphasise once again that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats does not wish to reduce the rights and responsibilities of the discharge authority, but that it would like to see how far we can get with the Council if we follow the strategy of negotiating this interinstitutional agreement. The main problem is reciprocity, as the Council insists that it should be allowed to examine Parliament’s auditing process, adopting the same high-handed approach as it takes to answering our questions to the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">One more thing, Madam President; the bottom line for Parliament is that we cannot accept a situation where civil servants from the Member States control the public representatives who express the will of the citizens of Europe. Everything else is open to negotiation, so perhaps we shall succeed in making a little progress today.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I am the rapporteur for the European Union’s decentralised agencies for 2010 and for public-private partnership enterprises. Discharge procedures are applied to 24 centralised agencies and seven public-private partnership enterprises. In the case of three agencies, I am proposing to postpone discharge, mainly for reasons relating to conflicts of interest and public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to say a few words about the significance of the conflicts of interest. Conflicts between the public duties and private interests of those in public positions have grown as a result of the barriers coming down between the public and private sectors, of public-private partnerships, and of staff switching between both sectors. This has produced grey areas and potential conflicts of interests for those in public positions. The conflict of interest arises when a person in a public position has to make decisions which may affect private interests.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If conflicts of interest are not identified and dealt with properly, they can distort the allocation of public funds and HR policy, and can result in public money being wasted and in ordinary citizens losing confidence in European public institutions. This is why conflicts of interest must be investigated and punished during the discharge procedure. It is our job to look at conflicts of interest when we are carrying out audits and making decisions on discharging all the European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I recommend postponing discharge for the European Food Safety Authority. This agency is involved in authorising the safety of the food and drink we consume every day. Our health also depends on the decisions of this authority. This is why the conflicts of interest in this agency, mainly in the management board, are a matter of concern. There are numerous examples which have also been publicised. I will just mention a very recent one. Diána Bánáti joined an organisation funded by the food industry on 8 May, just two days ago, and resigned, at the authority’s request, from her post as a member and chair of the management board. There are other cases of this in the management board of the European Food Safety Authority, for instance, those involving the groups of experts. In addition, the meetings held by the board members in 2010 cost more than EUR 6 000 per person at the meeting, the highest cost among all the agencies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Medicines Agency is the second body which I am suggesting should have its discharge postponed. This agency is also facing problems of conflict of interest. It has an extremely important role in the procedure for implementing, approving and authorising the medicines we use, which enter the market. The agency has drafted a plan for avoiding and preventing conflicts of interest. However, I am proposing to Parliament that we see how this plan is applied because application and implementation are the key issue. If it is applied properly, we certainly may come to a different decision in the autumn.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The third body is the European Environment Agency, where we have noticed problems relating to public procurement and the spending of public money. For example, a green façade which lasted all of five months cost around EUR 300 000, and was produced without going through the tender process and without being included in the agency’s work plan and investments. There are also other issues relating to public procurement and conflicts of interest even involving the agency’s actual executive director.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Postponing discharge is not an action directed against the agencies, quite the opposite. It is intended to help them and us resolve these problems together. It sends a strong message to Member States and the Commission, and in support of the proposals which they are tabling in the boards of these agencies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I am rapporteur for the granting of a discharge for the European Parliament 2010 budget. As always when assessing the European Parliament for a given year, it is tempting to deal with a wider range of issues than the financial year in question. I would like to state clearly that we are focusing on the financial year 2010, while bearing in mind that this was the first year in which the European Parliament acted within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon. It was also the first year in which we had assistants employed under a different status than before, and it was the first year in which we had a full base year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to admit right at the outset that there were no large accruals or deferrals during this first year, which was progress as compared to 2009. Nevertheless, the European Court of Auditors still highlighted three areas where additional solutions and supplementary information are required.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The first is the question of payments for groups visiting Parliament. We must be careful in this respect, since the system has to work. Secondly, improvements in the purchasing control system. Thirdly and finally, better documentation in human resources management in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As Members of the European Parliament, we, too, pointed out some areas where savings should be made, especially during the present crisis. In addition, as rapporteur, I have put forward sixteen relevant amendments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We would like to suggest that savings could firstly be made by abolishing the Journalist Award, which was proposed in 2009. We would request that this proposal be acted on. Secondly, we would like to point out that construction costs for the visitor centre are overrunning the budget set. We would also like to point out that much more detailed information is needed as regards planned expenditure on European Parliament buildings, even though 2010 showed clearly that the construction and ownership of its own buildings is a cheaper option for the European Parliament than rental.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Security in Parliament is another specific package of proposals and solutions that we consider in this report. We note the progress made and the increased efficiency of translation, especially written translation. Clear progress has been made in this area, although much can be done within Parliament to improve the timeliness of requests.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Two areas that still require improvement are our internal travel agency, where we would ask for more analysis to be carried out in terms of the relationship between quality and the price that we pay for the service. We note improvements in the area of the IT system and we would like to point out that only 5.6% of the entire EU administration budget is spent on the European Parliament. Nevertheless, we could make improvements even within this 5.6%. 2010 has shown that progress has been made and that our institution’s work has become more efficient. I would like to thank all my fellow Members and the Secretary-General for their effective cooperation as well as the European Court of Auditors and our internal auditor for the results that we have achieved together.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Nicolai Wammen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very pleased to be able to participate today in this very important debate on the correct implementation of the EU budget. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Geier and the rest of this House for its very warm reception of the Danish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start by stressing the particular importance which the Council attaches to the proper spending of EU appropriations. This applies especially in times of economic and financial crisis, when many Member States have to cut their national budgets and keep their expenditure under strict control, and when European citizens and taxpayers pay even closer attention to the correct use of public funds, not only at the national but also at the European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 28 February, my colleague, Minister Vestager, was in the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control to present the Council’s recommendation to give a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget for 2010. On that occasion, she was able to participate in a very interesting and fruitful debate on the implementation of the EU budget, which concentrated, in particular, on its implementation under shared management by the Commission and Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">It again became evident that the European Parliament and the Council share the same concerns. We therefore both addressed the fact that a large share of payments from the EU budget is still materially affected by error, and we both follow the overall aim of attaining an unqualified audit opinion from the European Court of Auditors. In that context, I would like to mention that Minister Vestager has informed her colleagues in Ecofin about the issues raised by the Committee on Budgetary Control during the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can only repeat what was said in February. The Council would like to see more progress in the financial management and control of EU funds. It encouraged the Commission to fully assume its responsibility in the implementation of the budget, to reinforce its supervision and control structures, and to strengthen its cooperation with and its guidance to Member State authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council recalls in this context the importance of recoveries and financial corrections which are an essential element in protecting the Union’s financial interest and in improving the management of EU funds. Payment should be interrupted and suspended whenever significant deficiencies are identified and until corrective action is fully implemented. Unduly paid amounts should be recovered without delay and full transparency in the implementation of corrective action must be ensured.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure you that the Council Presidency will make all possible efforts to make progress on this issue and I have noted that many of the Council’s priorities are also those of the European Parliament; I therefore count on your cooperation and support. We can improve the situation if all actors – the European Parliament, Council, Commission and Member States – work constructively together towards the sound financial management and an efficient control of EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ongoing negotiations and the revision of the Financial Regulation are a perfect opportunity to improve and simplify procedures, and to reasonably strengthen supervision and control without creating any excessive administrative burden.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I have to say a few words on the disagreement between the European Parliament and the Council on the discharge procedure between our institutions. The Council is of the opinion that it is important to find a durable solution to this recurring problem and that this solution should be based on three principles: accountability, transparency and reciprocity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, the Council has made a proposal to the European Parliament on the discharge procedure, and the Council has asked the European Parliament to appoint a formal delegation to discuss this proposal and to solve the outstanding issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish Presidency looks forward to the continuing informal dialogue between our institutions on this issue, which we hope can pave the way to solving our disagreements. I welcome therefore this debate today and I am looking forward to a very constructive cooperation with the Commission, the European Parliament, the Member States and the Council.</p>

    <intervention id="4-020-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Algirdas Šemeta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all, let me start by thanking you for the constructive and fruitful work achieved over the last few months. The Commission has been in close contact with your rapporteur and your colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control to discuss all kinds of issues related to the sound financial management of the main EU programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Six Members of the Commission and the Secretary-General of the Commission participated in very lively discharge hearings. This intense dialogue between the institutions demonstrates the importance, but also the complexity, of the matters which we have to deal with. The Commission appreciated very much this trustful and good cooperation and I am looking forward to continuing to work with you on the topics we have discussed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur mentioned four priority actions for the Commission and I would like to stress that the Commission is fully aware of your concerns and your expectations vis-à-vis the Commission, but also vis-à-vis other financial actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to highlight the implementation of financial engineering instruments as one example where the Commission has proactively taken into account the outcome of the discussions we had. Following the Commission’s proposal, Member States have to provide more focused and detailed reports on the implementation of these instruments. As a consequence, by the end of the year, we should have all necessary information to hand to provide you with an analysis per Member State and a comprehensive evaluation of the use of financial engineering instruments. But more has been done. In anticipation of the need for closer monitoring, the Commission proposal for the next programming period already envisages enhanced monitoring and control mechanisms for those financial instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apart from the priority actions highlighted by the rapporteur, the discharge report includes many more requests to the Commission. They are all being analysed and will be followed up. A comprehensive report on the follow-up to the discharge requests and on the concrete actions taken will be issued later this year, together with the evaluation report required under Article 318 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I consider the effective implementation of these recommendations to be of the utmost importance in addressing the weaknesses identified in the implementation of the EU budget. We have discussed the role of Member States in the implementation of the EU budget many times already. Member States have a crucial role when it comes to the operational implementation of EU programmes and projects. The authorities of the Member States are paying out, and controlling on the spot, some 80% of the EU budget to final beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is no doubt that the Commission will continue to assume its final responsibility for the correct implementation of the EU budget, in accordance with the Treaty. But to reduce the error rate under shared management, we do need the Member States’ cooperation and commitment to assuming their responsibility as the first-level financial actors in direct contact with the final beneficiaries.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the last annual report from the Court of Auditors has revealed, Member States’ authorities did not detect and correct many errors, even though they had the necessary information available. Further work on effective – but also proportionate – supervisory and monitoring mechanisms in the current period and for the future is therefore necessary.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission appreciates your support in further developing these mechanisms and improving the implementation procedures at Member State level. The provision of reliable and complete financial information and audit data by the Member States is one example of an area where improvements are necessary. We can see some progress in this regard, but this is not yet satisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why the Commission will, from now on, transmit the annual summaries of the Member States with an analysis of their content to the Committee on Budgetary Control, in accordance with Article 319 of the Treaty. Where appropriate, the Commission will make recommendations to the national authorities on how to further improve this reporting instrument so they can contribute better to the Commission’s assurance process. The discharge authority will be informed about these recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, their publication remains subject to the conditions set in the legislation on public access to the EU institutions’ documents.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I would like to recall the importance of introducing a management declaration of assurance, which the Commission has proposed in the revision of the Financial Regulation. This would be an important building block towards an improved assurance chain between the management and control bodies in the Member States and the Commission services. Here as well, in the negotiations on the Financial Regulation, the Commission is on the side of Parliament to ensure the highest level of transparency and accountability from the Member States. We have, moreover, proposed introducing political accountability through the possibility of submitting national declarations of assurance. Provided that Member States’ national declarations respect necessary conditions, the Commission will, as an incentive, take those declarations into account in the establishment of its own audit strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the European Development Fund, we welcome the Parliament’s recommendations. The area of external aid is, by nature, a risky and complex one. An error level of 3.4% is limited but remains a source of concern for both this House and the Commission. We will take all necessary actions to further improve the EDF’s financial management, securing the effectiveness and sustainability of the EU’s support, which is badly needed by the ACP countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">This discharge procedure provided valuable input for the negotiations on the next financial period. Several new measures included in our proposals for the next generation of EU spending programmes were inspired by the European Court of Auditors and the discharge authority.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will demonstrate its firm commitment to achieving all possible improvements. The discharge report on which you will vote is a clear road map for actions to be taken by the Commission and the other financial actors.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am honoured to be the first President of the European Court of Auditors to be invited to address Parliament at this stage in the discharge procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">The discharge procedure is essential for European Union public accountability. It helps provide citizens with assurance as to what European funds were spent on, whether they were used correctly, and what was achieved with them. The primary responsibility for answering these questions lies with those responsible for managing European funds: the Commission and the relevant national authorities. They need to put in place systems capable of doing so.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court’s role is to provide independent assessments of the quality of their financial management and reporting systems. For the financial year 2010, the Court concluded that the European Union accounts prepared by the Commission do provide a reliable picture of what European Union funds were spent on. We noted, however, that the Commission does not yet provide a complete and reliable set of information on whether European Union funds have been correctly raised and spent.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the basis of our own audit testing, the Court concluded that revenue and commitments underlying the European Union accounts were legal and regular in all material respects. In contrast to this, payments underlying these accounts were affected by material error with an estimated error rate of 3.7% overall. As in previous years, the area most prone to error was cohesion. We also concluded that systems were only partly effective overall and that there continued to be risks in the other areas of expenditure, which need to be managed and disclosed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court recommended that due account should be taken of these risks when revising the legislative instrument for the next programming period. In particular, the Court stressed that reforms should focus on both reducing errors and improving the results we achieve with the funds of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also important to ensure there is adequate provision for transparency. The Commission’s reporting on results achieved needs to be improved. In particular, we emphasised the need to set smart objectives and milestones for the new programming period. This is a point we also stressed in our recent opinions on the new legislative proposals governing the main areas of expenditure for the period 2014 to 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the discharge decision on the 2009 financial year, this Parliament invited the Court to present an opinion on the evaluation report required by the Lisbon Treaty. This report was delivered in February this year by the Commission and we will issue an opinion shortly. The Court believes that this first evaluation report represents an initial step in the right direction and provides Parliament, the Council and the Commission with an opportunity to discuss and agree how it can be made useful to the discharge authority as an instrument for European Union transparency and accountability.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Court believes that an effective discharge procedure is essential for the European Union’s accountability and we are fully committed to working with Parliament and the other partners in this process to achieve that goal each year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament approved discharge for the financial year 2010 on 13 February 2012, at an extraordinary meeting. In our sphere of competence, that means four European agencies: the European Training Foundation, Cedefop, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, and the Agency for Improvement of Working Conditions. We were pleased to establish that the annual reports are in line with the actual financial situation of 31 December and that the procedures carried out and the cash flow in the year in question comply with the financial rules of the agencies. Our opinion matched that of the European Court of Auditors in other respects.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We could reach the same conclusion regarding the transactions that form the basis of the financial report. However, we drew attention to the need to work together more closely in planning future programmes and we welcomed the intention of the Commission to track Member States’ annual reports more closely. For example, in the case of the European Social Fund, the Commission is paying special attention to the added value provided by the European funds. In the case of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, we also pointed out the need to look at why only one third of the available amount has been drawn. This fund is the subject of quite considerable debate but, on the whole, I have to say that we are satisfied; this is the first year in which we do not have to raise serious objections concerning the financial management of the agencies.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on the Environment is responsible for the budget lines for the environment, public health and food safety, and controls 0.76% of the Union’s budget. Overall, we were very pleased with the implementation rates. A full 99.26% of resources are tied up in the environment and climate change sector, while the figure in the LIFE programme, our flagship and our only financial instrument for the environment, was 99.4%. The rate was also above 99% in the health sector too. All the available information leads us to the recommendation that the Commission should be granted discharge.</p>
      <p sl="de">I have been dealing with agencies in various capacities for seven and a half years. These seven and a half years have taught me that it is the decentralised agencies that do the lion’s share of the work in Europe, fulfilling the tasks assigned to them by the legislators, Parliament and Council under the ordinary legislative procedure. For seven and a half years, I have seen how the agencies are under particularly close public scrutiny. More than ever before, the specialist committees are particularly rigorous in exercising political control over the agencies. We want to know what staff in the agencies do, how they do it, and what happens with the resources from the Community budget. The agencies’ budgets are not arbitrarily organised in the budgetary process, nor are the agencies absolved of responsibility in the discharge process.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, during these seven and a half years, I have never experienced so many half-truths, insinuations and misinformation being used to create an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion towards the agencies and the people working in them during the discharge process. This is not worthy of the working practices normally followed in this House. This fatal combination is the reason why the Committee on Budgetary Control has applied to defer the discharge for three agencies, the Medicines Agency, the Environment Agency and the Food Safety Authority. Of course, I support criticism of excessively high carry-overs to the next year and of the extremely high cost of governing body meetings. However, these issues do not justify the deferral of the discharge.</p>
      <p sl="de">Speaking from my seven and a half years of experience working with agencies, I can only recommend that our decision in relation to granting discharge should not be based on an unholy mix of half-truths, misinformation and insinuations. With all the information available to us, we can confidently grant discharge to all agencies without exception.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first, please let me make a remark. Today, the part-session of the European Parliament is debating 43 reports concerning discharge, which means that we can spend somewhat less than four minutes per report on how the money of tax-paying European citizens is spent. To put that into numbers, the European Parliament is so amazingly capable that it can control EUR 1 billion in funds used in the budget of the European Union and the budgets of the various agencies every minute. In my opinion, if the European Parliament is that amazingly capable, then this body should be appointed as some kind of European auditing company. Perhaps this limited time is unworthy of such an extensive matter.</p>
      <p sl="hu">With regard to the question of cohesion policy, the error rate is lower than in the previous programming period. I feel this is important to mention because following the discharge procedures, the question of the error rate always tends to be used to cudgel cohesion policy. In the field of cohesion policy, the error rate primarily results from disregarding public procurement rules and payment entitlements. I think this certainly underlines the need for simplification.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, the Committee on Fisheries has carried out an exhaustive job, considering that this is a post-Lisbon codecision matter.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this sense, the execution rate was 97.20%, hence a good execution rate as recorded in the accounts. Despite this, however, under one of the headings, a specific heading, the heading for fish markets, number 1102, had very little execution, for which the Commission gave some quite satisfactory explanations, but these do not suggest that there will be much change in the following years.</p>
      <p sl="it">Equally, one of the issues underlined is the execution of international fishing agreements. In these, the commercial aspect is too dominant compared with the aspect linked to growth in the sector: 72% is a commercial agreement. Therefore, the fishing agreements probably need to have a slightly different execution that takes into account the policy objectives of these agreements.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will close, Madam President, with just one more small comment, which is that there are reports that have been challenged for almost a decade, the closure of which is still being delayed.

      <p sl="da">Madam President, overall, we in the Committee on Culture and Education are happy with the implementation of the budget for 2010, which is also apparent from the opinion that the committee adopted earlier this year. Our satisfaction is expressed in paragraphs 1 to 4 of our opinion, the details of which I will not go into here. However, there is one area with which we, as a committee, or as Parliament, cannot be satisfied. This is explained in paragraph 5 and, to put it briefly, concerns a very promising pan-European TV network, to which the Commission chose to put a stop at the last minute. This was done without the consent of Parliament and the Council, and the reason given for doing so was the fact that we are living in times of austerity. Therefore, it is obviously a little surprising to find that, instead of saving the money, the Commission is choosing to spend it on the TV channel Euronews and a host of public relations activities within the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="da">This is clearly not something that we, as Parliament, can be happy about, and therefore the Committee on Culture and Education, along with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has chosen to withhold the funds for the Commission’s budget until it commits to re-establishing the network concerned. Until this happens, as budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education, I cannot recommend the release of these funds that we are talking about, and I would ask the Committee on Budgetary Control to look into the matter so that we can get this important initiative re-established.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to give you our opinion on the discharge of Europol and Eurojust.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to Europol, there is very little and, in fact, almost nothing, to find fault with. The annual accounts essentially reflect the financial situation in 2010, and all of the transactions that they are based on comply with the rules and are therefore also legal. The only things that stand out are the high carryovers compared with the accrued costs, which, overall, are actually low. Europol attributes this to the move to new headquarters, which is clearly understandable. However, Europol promises to take additional measures in future to avoid such high carryovers. In addition, Europol is committing itself to monitoring the implementation of the budget on a monthly basis from 2012 onwards. I recommend that we check whether that does actually happen. Against this background, I recommend that we grant discharge to Europol.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where Eurojust is concerned, the annual accounts also essentially reflect the financial situation in 2010. All of the transactions here are also legal and compliant with the rules. However, here too, a high level of operational expenditure was carried forward to 2011. Eurojust’s explanation for this was that it was mainly due to an Organisational Structural Review project – a new computer infrastructure and the costs related to data processing. The agency has stated that it will improve all of this in future, and that it will also improve its compliance with the tendering requirements. I recommend that we check this in future, too, and in particular, that we check whether all vacant posts are actually filled in future. This situation has improved. However, if these posts are not filled soon, we will have to consider cancelling some funding, and that would have a negative impact on Eurojust. I nevertheless recommend that we grant discharge.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should first like to welcome the efforts made by the European Police College (CEPOL), which has made a strong recovery after the problems we experienced with it. I do, however, regret that the amendments I submitted in the Committee on Budgetary Control regarding the merger between CEPOL and Europol were not adopted and I should like to protest against the amendments accepted in the vote in committee and against this merger.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission will propose a new legal basis to us, probably in the autumn or at the start of next year. I believe that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) is much more competent than the Committee on Budgetary Control to adopt this new draft legal basis. Furthermore, I propose granting discharge to the three agencies (the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Environment Agency (EEA)). Why? Because we do not have sufficient reason to justify a postponement, much less to refuse to grant discharge in the autumn.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, accountable spending of public funding is currently a matter of great interest in the European Union. In particular, in this time of austerity, we at European level need to show that we are being extremely accountable when it comes to what we achieved, in this regard, in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am also a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and I have looked at various agencies and the Committee’s achievements in this field in 2010. As far as we are concerned, we are heading in the right direction. However, when it comes to the agencies, in particular, there are a lot of critical comments I could make, but I do dare argue that LIBE is heading in the right direction – as well it should.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I have two more questions for the Commission. First of all, the question of SIS I and SIS II. Do we have any more data on this at the moment? What are the spending trends (particularly since the system as such is not up to scratch)?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the External Borders Fund. I get the impression that we are still under-utilising the funding there at the moment. It is striking that, on the one hand, our citizens are saying that external borders should be better monitored and that, on the other hand, we are under-utilising funding.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction plays a crucial role in respect of a priority which should perhaps be supported more strongly and incisively by the European Parliament, and that is the battle against drugs and drug addiction, at a time when addiction is not limited to drugs and psychotropic substances, because there are other addictions that should and could be better tackled through a list of actions that the European Union should support.</p>
      <p sl="it">To go back to the assessment, we found that the financial management was properly carried out, and we believe that in the financial perspectives for 2014-2020, more resources should be allocated to a context in which adolescence is often subject to serious attack. Information sharing on the web is important, as are Facebook and the Internet, but these, too, can sometimes lead to specific types of addiction.</p>
      <p sl="it">The monitoring centre could propose improvements for supporting multilingualism and we believe that it can improve its work, which is extremely positive, still further by introducing flexible measures in organisational terms. Stronger ties, which, in actual fact, already exist, with other agencies and with the Member States would allow us to confirm that the prospects for growth in this delicate area exist, based on a principle and value which is that of an overall strategy on addiction, and therefore not just on addiction to drugs.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the role of the European Parliament is, as is the case with every parliament, to legislate, to represent the voice of the voters and to scrutinise policy. We have those three roles. As regards the last role, namely that of scrutiniser of power, scrutiniser of the implementation of policy, we are not as good at that as we are in the role of legislator or that of voter representative.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This applies, in particular, to our scrutiny of the spending of the European Development Fund. This fund is outside the EU budget, thus a lot less transparent to us than the Development Cooperation Instrument. It is money that is spent outside the EU and, hence, it is even more invisible to us. However, we do have the power to grant discharge for it. That is very clever of us, but I think that we should not overestimate ourselves. National parliaments do not carry out audits either.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The European Development Fund should therefore be brought within the EU budget as soon as possible. That would strengthen our opportunities for scrutiny. It is very unsatisfactory to have to work like that. However, if it is brought within the EU budget, that should not be an excuse to reduce the total amount of development money.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Madam President, I was entrusted with drawing up opinions for the civil liberties LIBE Committee. I have drawn up opinions regarding three agencies, namely, Frontex, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Data Protection Supervisor.</p>
      <p sl="mt">The LIBE Committee has now extended its competence to cover a good number of European agencies, and naturally we should not only establish new agencies, but also ensure that these operate correctly and that their allocated budgets are used appropriately. While carrying out my analyses, I identified a number of issues and practices that need to be improved upon, one such example being the use of allocated budgets during the year following the particular year for which they were initially allocated. This is a practice in which we ask agencies not to persist. I also came across personnel recruitment procedures which could have been carried out in a better way. In my opinion, I stated that these practices have to be rectified.</p>
      <p sl="mt">Nevertheless, I can say that the overall management of the agencies regarding which I carried out my investigations is satisfactory, and should therefore be accepted. Moreover, even the Court of Auditors declared that we should grant discharge to these agencies, in light of the fact that their annual accounts were legal and regular.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as shadow rapporteur for the Parliament’s discharge, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Liberadzki, for the work he has done. In committee, I think, we reached a good compromise which identifies concrete areas for improvement. I urge all my colleagues not to accept any appeals to reject this resolution but, on the contrary, to support it. I will briefly address three points which I consider important in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">First: public procurement. We need clearer rules. We call on the Bureau to review all control mechanisms in order to guarantee the most competitive prices for the services and goods offered.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second: security, which is still a major issue for many MEPs. In the report, we have targeted concrete areas where improvements could be made.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third: the internal auditors’ report. We hope this will be provided to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control on time, so that we can make a clear assessment of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now let me quickly comment on some issues arising from the Commission discharge. First, I want to congratulate rapporteur Christofer Fjellner for his excellent work and energy during the whole procedure. There are a number of important aspects this year, of which the first is shared management. This year again, the Court of Auditors has not been able to issue a positive declaration of assurance on the Union budget. I call on the Commission to find the appropriate tools and to apply stricter and adequate sanctions in order to ensure that Member States assume their responsibilities. I note, however, the presence of the Council at today’s debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second aspect concerns financial instruments. Their use is continually increasing and they are indeed useful, but we do not know to what extent. We need to assess them better, using appropriate indicators, and to establish a clear link between inputs and results.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third aspect is that of instruments for financial assistance. The EU budget guarantees loans and the balance of payments in the European Financial Stability Mechanism for a maximum of EUR 110 billion. This is almost an annual budget, and we definitely need clearer accountability and greater transparency with regard to operations under these instruments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to welcome the important role that the Court of Auditors plays in the whole discharge process, and I am certain that our fruitful cooperation will continue on all aspects of budgetary control.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, I wish to give the opinion of the European agencies from the perspective of the European Socialists. We are speaking about the agencies, which form an important part of the European institutional superstructure. They were created by the governments in agreement with the Parliament to benefit European citizens by performing the assigned tasks. In other words, they were not established by accident. Every single agency was created through a political and policy-based codecision procedure, and their operation is sometimes very complex. These organisations are too important to be used for power games and political games, and suggesting their abolishment is also something that could have serious political consequences.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The agencies play an important role, which is why it is crucial that their operation and management be as flawless as possible, since that is the way to guarantee their good reputation in the minds of EU citizens. Nevertheless, the European agencies operate from less than half a per cent of the European Union budget. They are subject to just as strict controls during the discharge procedure as any EU body. In our opinion, such controls need to be proportionate with their weighting in the budget. Disproportionately strict control in itself is wasteful, and currently we feel that the organisations of the European Court of Auditors and the European Parliament in charge of the discharge procedure are using their limited personnel and material resources to deal with the agencies to a disproportionate degree. We believe that needs to end. It is unacceptable that we are wasting half our resources on cases accounting for roughly half a per cent of the budget.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We had serious concerns regarding the highly critical approach of the rapporteur, because she worked on a basis of guilty until proven innocent. Instead, we think that good faith and a natural sense of justice need to be taken as the starting point until the contrary is proven. I think that the remarks made so far have borne out our approach, since the opinions given by the committees were significantly more positive here, in the part-session too, than the opinion of the rapporteur, and I think that Parliament as a whole is more inclined to agree with that.</p>
      <p sl="hu">I now wish to address some points consistently raised in the report, namely, the question of how can we use the most appropriate procedures and tools to avoid potential conflicts of interest, especially in the case of those agencies that need to bring in industry or technical experts. We therefore recommend, as did the Ombudsman, that special attention be paid to this question. We strongly supported the European Court of Auditors preparing a special report on this topic, and we also strongly support the interinstitutional working group of the Council, Commission and the Parliament keeping this topic on the agenda. However, that is not a reason not to approve the 2010 discharge. I would like to say therefore that the approach adopted by the rapporteur needs to be reflected on. In the future, it would be wise to prepare a report in cooperation with colleagues from her own party and the other parties from other committees that is better accepted in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, although the Danish Presidency is not listening, unfortunately, I would, first of all, welcome Denmark to this meeting. It is the first time in many years that the Council has attended.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is the seventeenth consecutive year that we have had a negative report from the European Court of Auditors. That alone should be a reason for Parliament not to grant discharge to the Commission. I do not think there are many national parliaments that would be so lenient towards their governments if that were to happen, nor is the trend heading in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Over the years, Parliament has made a lot of suggestions as to how this could be done. The role of Member States is essential in this regard. As the Commissioner said, 80% of the money is spent by Member States. That is why the European Parliament clearly stated in Article 44 of the 2006 interinstitutional agreement that Member States should submit annual statements of assurance and that the Commission should then provide comments on them. Parliament would be able to analyse that and start a dialogue with the Commission on improvements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For six years, Parliament has not been able to acquaint itself with those annual statements. That is extremely odd. If you have an agreement between three parties, then it would make sense to me that those statements should also be available to those parties.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I welcome the Commission’s statement but, unfortunately, the Commissioner did not make any reference to Article 44 of the interinstitutional agreement. That article is essential. I find it extremely unfortunate that he has failed to refer to it. However, he has made some progress. His statement will have an impact on the voting behaviour of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which will probably differ from that of the Committee on Budgetary Control itself. At the time, they voted against, but I will keep the surprise until the end.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I shall confine myself to five reports in this debate: the discharge of the Council and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITER), on the one hand, and the reports of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Environment Agency (EEA), on the other.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As regards the Council, I call again for reasonableness and for us to accommodate the demands of the discharge authority. We want nothing less than insight into the accounts. Transparency of spending is quite simply necessary, because the Council’s spending is of an essentially different order than forty years ago.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As regards ITER, I call for my amendment to be approved. It is aimed at reassessing the ITER project and at taking stock of our future financing needs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Next, the agencies. There is a fundamental distinction between EMA and EFSA, on the one hand, and EEA, on the other. EMA and EFSA have been under fire for years and, as far as EEA is concerned, we actually just want to dot the i’s. As regards EMA and EFSA, I would draw your attention to the funding for both agencies. Seventy-three per cent of EMA’s funding already comes from fees paid by the pharmaceutical industry. For EFSA, the European Food Safety Authority, that is not yet the case, but it will come onto the agenda. And that is dangerous. We need appropriate rules and, if we do not get them, the very least we will see out there is the perception that the results of product evaluation may have been interfered with.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Committee on Budgetary Control calls attention to the need to fight conflicts of interest and the revolving door policy. With regard to EMA, we find ourselves in the role of a former director who has formed a consulting firm while still in office, who is now working there and providing consultancy to the pharmaceutical industry. That is a reprehensible practice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Turning to EFSA: I visited the European Food Safety Authority in Parma just last week, together with an EEA delegation. The good news is that EFSA is committed to transparency and change. It has also shown that the efforts of Parliament and individual members of this House are really working. The work done by the rapporteur, the work of a member such as José Bové, is remarkable and is very helpful. EFSA recognised with much delay that there was something wrong with one of its former employees moving to a company like Syngenta. We call particular attention to the ties between members of the management board, EFSA’s scientific experts, and ILSI, a notorious lobbying organisation funded by food giants such as McDonalds, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, BASF, Danone, Kraft, Monsanto, Syngenta and Unilever. That is problematic. It is good that the chair of the management board resigned the day before yesterday, because her ties with ILSI have been, and still are, too close. Incidentally, since yesterday, she has been in that organisation’s active employment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">EFSA’s scientific research should not only rely on research and data from industry. Independent experts and independent research must also get a chance. We have to monitor the ties between scientific experts and the biotech industry, the food companies and lobby groups. We are not going to grant discharge now because we want to issue a concrete action plan, so that in October, we can grant discharge to EFSA, too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With regard to the Court of Auditors, I ask that a report on potential conflicts of interest at EMA and EFSA be published urgently.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, a few brief comments on the European Environment Agency. The agency’s utility value is not at issue. However, what is at issue are a number of past practices: director’s ties with an NGO and potential problems concerning public procurement. I call for close cooperation between Parliament and the EEA so that we can clear up these matters and so that we can grant discharge to the agency in October. Thank you, Madam President, for allowing me to speak for a few additional seconds.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their work and their rational approach. The European Court of Auditors has found a whole series of deficiencies in the running of individual bodies and agencies, just as in previous years.</p>
      <p sl="cs">With regard to the Commission, we see a recurring problem in the sharing of management in cooperation with Member State audit bodies. In view of the fact that there are two areas with an alarming error rate, we must rapidly adopt a regime that would enable the Commission to assess the individual problems of Member States and react to them in time.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The large number of errors in the management of individual agencies is of concern. We are therefore pleased that the rapporteur decided to postpone the granting of discharge for four of them. We should think about how to achieve a reduction in operating costs, for example, by sharing services between agencies according to geographical proximity or according to policy area.</p>
      <p sl="cs">With regard to the European Parliament, we support the search for savings. For example, it is possible to reduce expenditure on awards, as the rapporteur has already said here, or reduce expenditure on the presentation of Parliament, such as the expenditure on the Parliamentarium or the House of European History.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to end by saying that until the EU budget as a whole receives a positive statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group has decided not to support a grant of discharge for any part of the EU budget, and, on the contrary, has decided to support a postponement in the cases proposed by the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the procedure whereby we in this House approve the use of the EU budget by the Commission and the other institutions is our greatest responsibility as representatives of the citizens of the Member States. Yet, year after year, while the Court of Auditors fails to give the EU spending a clean bill of health, this House is happy to approve the management’s performance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The auditors’ report for the year 2010 reveals that the error rate – a fine name for the irregular use of funds – has grown from 3.3% to 3.7%. They add that 50% of the transactions sampled were affected by errors. How can we tell taxpayers that their money has been properly spent when we have this situation? Worse, how can we ask taxpayers to put even more into policy areas such as cohesion, energy and transport, where the error rate has increased to an astonishing 7.7%?</p>
      <p sl="en">The increase in the number of agencies from three to 24 in a decade is a matter of concern. The Commission seems to have little control over them, which means that, in the discharge reports, one sees the same stories again and again: conflicts of interest and a revolving door to outside employers at least as efficient as the ones in this building.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet while this House is prepared to turn a blind eye to the deficiencies of those responsible for most of the budget, including itself, it puts great energy into refusing to approve the management of the Council’s budget. It is not that I want to defend the Council, but this is merely playing politics – and that, in essence, is what the discharge procedure has become, a political game. So, dear taxpayers, nobody actually cares how your money is spent. The solution? Stop sending money to Brussels!</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, the European Union has an annual turnover of billions of euro. This is effected by the Commission, the Council, Parliament and a whole host of institutions and agencies. These several billion euro have not just fallen from the sky. They come from hard-working taxpayers in the 27 Member States. What is more, these are taxpayers who have experienced cuts and reductions in recent years. Therefore, an absolutely key question is: who is checking, on behalf of these taxpayers, how all of this money is being spent?</p>
      <p sl="da">The European Parliament is the only institution that is directly elected by EU citizens. The answer is therefore the European Parliament, as national parliaments cannot scrutinise the whole of the EU. Or perhaps is it more correct to say that Parliament does this where most EU institutions are concerned. Parliament does not do this where the Council is concerned, however, simply because the Council refuses to answer the questions we ask about its accounts. The Council has had various explanations for why it considers itself to be above parliamentary scrutiny. First of all, the Council referred to the so-called gentlemen’s agreement, but when we dug this out, it emerged that it was a unilateral declaration by the Council – a declaration which, incidentally, originates from 1970, that is to say, nine years before Parliament was even directly elected.</p>
      <p sl="da">Now the Council is referring to the fact that, pursuant to the Treaty, Parliament is only permitted to approve the Commission’s accounts, and when it has done so, it will also have approved the accounts of all the other EU institutions. I think this is a very interesting point of view, as the only logical conclusion we can draw from this is that, in future, we will have to put our questions concerning the Council’s accounts to the Commission. If the Commission is unable to answer them, it will obviously have consequences for our approval of the Commission’s accounts. That would, of course, be absurd. Therefore, I also hope that the Council will see sense and answer the questions that we have put to it. There is rarely complete agreement in a parliament, but in the Committee on Budgetary Control’s recommendation for this meeting, there was absolute unanimity on postponing the decision concerning the Council’s accounts to the autumn. We have thereby shown our good will, as it will give the Council and the Danish Presidency yet another opportunity to tackle this secrecy and instead accept budgetary control by Parliament, which applies to all other EU institutions. Better late than never!</p>

I would like to express my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its numerous very sensible suggestions on this subject. I would also like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs for his increasing efforts to regulate budget aid in a sensible way. Budget aid is appropriate if there is a degree of certainty that the local administration is capable of using this budget aid to implement the projects undertaken in cooperation with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, we need to come up with a consistent concept in the area of development aid. I find myself repeating at every discharge hearing that all development aid spending needs to be introduced into the Commission budget at the same time and not just because we want to avoid exceeding the 1% limit. The money will certainly be spent. The question is simply whether it is spent in a coordinated, consistent and mutually agreed way and whether the European Parliament can play a role in spending decisions, rather than just monitoring spending.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is for this reason that I believe it is necessary to focus on the question of long-term and short-term measures in the context of development aid. We need long-term sustainable measures that will lead to improvements in the relevant countries as the years progress. Naturally, we also need short-term measures that can provide rapid relief in response to disasters, such as earthquakes, etc. However, when it comes to long-term projects, we cannot allow standards to be relaxed simply because the conditions in a particular country are not what they might be. Our projects need to make sense and have a purpose, otherwise we will find ourselves spending money for no good reason.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Ms Andreasen has just asked the European taxpayer to stop paying money to Brussels because, supposedly, no one is interested in spending practices. Exactly the opposite is true. This House is extremely interested in the spending practices of the EU institutions and what happens with the European taxpayers’ money. The problem is that our conclusions are different from those of Ms Andreasen. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats certainly comes to very different conclusions in relation to the situation of the European agencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let me give you a brief run-down based on the example of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Thanks to the work of our rapporteur of last year, Mr Stavrakakis, the EMA now has the strictest ‘Conflict of interest’ system in Europe. The rapporteur for the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has come to the conclusion that this is not enough and suggests that the discharge should be deferred, arguing that this system must first prove itself. This is precisely the opposite of the burden of proof outlined by Ms Herczog in her contribution.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms Macovei, if the effectiveness of this system is to be put to the test, then this is the job of the next rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. If we find that the system does not work, then we can fine-tune it. However, to insist that an agency should not be discharged until the system has proven itself is to turn the burden of proof on its head.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I fail to understand your claim that you are not seeking to damage the agency. The damage has already been done. We simply need to take a look at how the media has reported on your report, questioning the independence of stakeholders or experts in the agencies. You have already inflicted the damage that you say you wanted to avoid.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do indeed have a problem. The problem is that we cannot find independent rapporteurs or experts because you will find it difficult to identify university lecturers who have not worked for industry in the past. It is also the function of the agencies to cooperate with the private sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">Perhaps we really do need absolute clarity in declarations, separation of responsibilities and regulations. This cannot be achieved by deferring the discharge, however, Ms Macovei. For this reason, we will not be supporting your report.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask who among you personally knows Professor McGlade, the Executive Director of the European Environment Agency (EEA)? I am asking that because most of you are on the verge of calling her integrity into serious doubt. This is the case despite the fact that, year in year out, the EEA has been viewed as an example of how an agency ought to be managed, despite the fact that, year in year out, the European Court of Auditors has stated that everything is fine with the EEA, and despite the fact that the EEA itself has refuted all the allegations or has shown that they simply are not true.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Postponing discharge is nothing more than a political motion of no-confidence against the current director. To be perfectly honest with you, the only conflict of interest that I see in Professor McGlade is the one between her incredible commitment to the agency of twenty hours per day and her personal health. That is the only real conflict.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The lack of any grounds for the postponement of discharge for the EEA makes me wonder if there might be a hidden agenda here. Might the EEA be too strong? Might Professor McGlade be too good a director? I hope that is not the case and I therefore make an urgent appeal, especially to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), to stop chasing shadows and to just grant discharge to the European Environment Agency, which it is entitled to.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, I should like to speak about the issue of granting discharge to agencies and specifically, the European Food Safety Authority. More than two years ago, I questioned Mr Dali about a possible conflict of interest concerning the President of that agency, Ms Bánáti. It turned out that I was correct: yesterday, Ms Bánáti was forced to resign on the eve of the forthcoming vote. Since she resigned, she has been recruited as director of the largest international agri-food lobby, the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), which brings together all the companies in the sector. We now have a genuine problem. Everyone is aware of that, including the director of that agency herself. We need to take a close look at the issue of conflicts of interest and the transparency of assessments. The same goes for medicines. Today, I am asking to postpone the vote on the discharge, not for financial reasons, but, very specifically, to ask the Commission to introduce clear rules in favour of transparency and against conflicts of interest.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – I think that this is a positive move, but it is not enough. We need clear rules. We do not, however, have clear rules on conflicts of interest at the moment, not only for the appointment of management boards, but also for the appointment of experts. That is why I think that we have to take our time. If we refuse to grant this discharge, we shall have an historic opportunity to create transparency so that there can be no ambiguity about these agencies. I am in favour of the agencies and their development, and also of an increase in their state funding to avoid conflicts of interest with the private sector. I am campaigning today to strengthen the agencies, but that can only be done by combating conflicts of interest and ensuring transparency.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, here we are again. Year after year, nothing changes and European taxpayers’ money continues to be wasted. The stark truth is that in 2012, we are still being asked to grant discharge to accounts which the Court of Auditors has condemned. ECR MEPs believe that taxpayers have a right to expect their money will be spent properly, so today we will be voting against the discharge. In some areas, we have gone backwards in tackling mis-spending. The error rate in Structural Funds has increased significantly, which is particularly disappointing given the Commission’s rhetoric on improving the situation in regional policy. There has been a clear failure of oversight from the Commission so I am encouraged that the Committee on Budgetary Control accepted our proposal that there should be a full-time budgetary control commissioner in the next Commission term. Such an important role cannot be a part-time job if we are serious about protecting taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also good news that the committee agreed with us on refusing to grant discharge to three agencies, but we should not have granted discharge to any of the agencies until they could demonstrate responsible management of public money. In such a difficult time for the European economy, it is completely unacceptable that even a penny of taxpayers’ money is squandered.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I will just focus on the report concerning discharge in respect of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). As you all know, EIGE meets all the requirements for sound finances and fulfils its commitments according to its remit.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Unfortunately, a sentence has been slipped into paragraph 3 of the committee’s proposal proposing a merger of EIGE with the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). This is a very strange proposal in view of the fact that EIGE was set up only a few years ago after more than 10 years of pressure from this Parliament. Even though EIGE and FRA clearly have aspects in common, there are also a lot of ways in which they differ.</p>
      <p sl="sv">EIGE focuses exclusively on gender and the structures and policy that could make us more effective within the area of gender equality. It concerns the labour market, social security, decision making and being able to combine work with family life. The European Parliament places gender equality high on the agenda, even when the Member States sometimes lack vision and ideas. We therefore need a fully-fledged institute that acts as a resource and that carries out indicative background work and monitoring within this important policy area. Paragraph 3 should therefore be deleted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I was the rapporteur on the discharge of the agencies in 2008. At the time, I wrote a wide variety of reports dealing with the issues criticised here in plenary and suggested that discharge should not be granted to 16 out of 20 agencies. These proposals were all voted down at the time. For this reason, I have a lot of sympathy for Ms Macovei, as she has succeeded in obtaining majority support on three report issues in the Committee, but is obviously finding this support waning. This development is very regrettable. I do not believe it reflects the will of Parliament that we should carry out such controls.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also regret the fact that you have failed to block the granting of discharge to a report relating to the ITER undertaking and that there was obviously no initiative in this regard. If one reads your report, it is evident that you are highly critical of numerous points. However, it is not clear that discharge is likewise to be blocked in points 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 and 27.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, interinstitutional cooperation between Parliament and the Council is vital for supervising the budget’s implementation. This is why any stalemate caused by the Council’s lack of compliance with the requests made by Parliament, in its capacity as the decision-making authority on budget discharge, is regrettable and damages this process. The decision to postpone the budget discharge must not be regarded as an obstacle hindering the negotiation process between Parliament and the Council. However, Parliament needs to stick to its guns and refuse to grant budget discharge if the Council is not going to comply with Parliament’s requests and meet all the conditions it has stipulated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Economic and Social Committee gave a prompt response to the comments made by Parliament. However, Parliament must keep a close eye on the investigations being conducted by OLAF and the European Ombudsman into the alleged irregularities in the administration of the Economic and Social Committee.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the European Development Fund (EDF), and I am confident that we will be able to reach agreement in this area, not only in committee, but also in plenary. This debate – and this is surely also important to mention – is taking place under the very particular circumstances of the hard times of economic and financial crisis within the European Union and, essentially, also worldwide. That is precisely why the attention of the general public is also on our debate here concerning discharge and the review of the budget. After all, we all actually want the budget to be correctly implemented and for it to be meaningful and, above all – I mention this with regard to the EDF in particular – sustainable, too. The EDF is our most important instrument for reducing poverty, that is to say, in the best interests of the European Union, for preventing wars and also for giving people prospects for the future. I am absolutely convinced that that is also the way the citizens and taxpayers see it.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Social Democrats support the report that we voted on in committee, although this was only after our amendments had been adopted and the report took a slightly different direction, as meaningful and necessary criticism is only right and proper. However, as Ms Herczog already mentioned, an attempt at politicisation is being made here, for example, with regard to the criticism of the United Nations. It goes without saying that the UN must improve its efficiency and, in particular, become more transparent. However, it is also an important partner for our work and it has useful infrastructure. We must, in any case, provide training in our offices and increase capacity, as that is the only way to work efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is something I would like to emphasise and, to conclude, I would like to state that we need a common assessment of the error rate and, of course, also a different agricultural policy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Europe has major economic and political problems. There are no excuses for carelessness with public funds, and the error rate in the budget is unacceptably high. However, the Commission itself is not responsible for all of the errors, we know that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Member States bear the main responsibility, and the major shortcomings that were mentioned earlier with regard to how the money is used at national level are unacceptable. Responsible politicians in these Member States must take responsibility for these errors – whether they are right or left leaning. It is no good pointing the finger at Brussels and the EU when it is your own management of the funds that has been careless. A number of the Member States have also refused to publish their annual reports concerning EU funds. Why this secrecy?</p>
      <p sl="sv">Commissioner, you have promised today that all reports are to be made available. That is good and it is what we want, but I think it is probably a bit late. We ought to have more time to be able to read through these reports and carry out a thorough analysis. I therefore believe that we should postpone the decision on discharge for the Commission so that we have time to go through all the facts. I think this is a reasonable request, and in view of what my colleagues in my group said earlier, I think that more people would be able to support it.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Lastly, I would like to say something about discharge in respect of the European Development Fund. It is problematic that the European Development Fund remains outside the EU budget. It must be integrated into the normal budgetary control process.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Criticism with respect to public procurement has been targeted at a green façade. It was a work of art and was acquired in accordance with the rules on works of art. The green façade was a very successful information project for the International Year of Biodiversity. Over half a million people saw it. The cost per 1 000 viewers was 50 cents.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Commission has recently proposed that the 2013 budget be increased by 7%. This is incredible. Government leaders in Greece, France and the Netherlands are having to stand down because they have to cut spending, but the EU budget is allowed to grow by 7%? Incredible.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is another reason to be critical about the size of the European budget. As regards the discharge for 2010, the rapporteur’s excellent work has made it clear that various agencies are spending their budgets irresponsibly. At the European Environment Agency, in particular, there seem to be many more things that have gone wrong. As long as the accountability of the agencies is not in order, we need to postpone their discharge.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At the same time, I need to point out that accountability for the European Parliament’s budget is also below standard.

      <p sl="it">Quite apart from some serious errors of management, especially as far as the Economic and Social Committee is concerned, I am puzzled by the very nature of their budgets, which are purely administrative. For both, in fact, we have 70% of expenditure on staff and the remaining 30% on buildings. I wonder what real added value these institutions can give to Europe. I am definitely in favour of a Europe of the regions, but the way the body supposed to represent them here is structured seems to me to make it pretty useless.</p>
      <p sl="it">Over EUR 200 million is spent on these two institutions each year with no concrete return.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is not primarily our job to give an opinion on whether the money was spent as we would wish or in agencies of which we would approve. It is, of course, to decide whether or not it was spent in accordance with the authority given to the agency in question. Some of these reports contain few, if any, criticisms, and the criticisms are minor. Assuming the rapporteurs were provided with accurate information and that they took account of that information, then Parliament should attest to that.</p>
      <p sl="en">A good example of this is Ms Macovei’s report on the European Centre for Disease Control.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Wammen, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, welcome to all of you! We are pleased that, for the first time, you are taking part altogether here in this debate on discharge. This really is like Christmas and Easter all in one day for us. It is something quite special today, and I would like to emphasise that once again.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to take the opportunity to address the President of the European Court of Auditors first. The debate has shown that, with regard to the agencies, we really need your Special Report on cost benchmarking of the European Union agencies. You informed the President of Parliament that, due to staffing problems, you were unable to prepare this report. I would ask you most sincerely to provide us with this report. It is a useful report, which we have been counting on, and are still counting on, to a considerable extent in the Working Group on agencies. I would ask you once again most sincerely to give us this report, in particular, the figures that we know to be very promising. We need these figures. Please give them to us. We also need your opinion on the subject of conflicts of interest in the agencies.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we are seeing here resembles a civil war in terms of relations within the European Parliament. I would simply like to point out that there is definite justification for criticising the agencies. Three of the 32 agencies have been criticised – that is to say, there are three agencies where we and our rapporteur see problems. I would like to expressly support the rapporteur on one particular point and that is regarding the European Environment Agency. My fellow Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament – and Mr Gerbrandy – you are making a mistake here. We have uncovered facts in this regard, and the more time we spend on this, the more questions we are forced to ask. It is simply not acceptable for an agency to give subsidies to a non-governmental organisation, for this non-governmental organisation to arrange seminars in distant parts of the world, and for it to then invite the employees of this agency to these seminars. I do not consider this to be acceptable. If you find that acceptable, then that is even worse! In my opinion, we need to do something about this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to address the Council. You spoke of reciprocal screening. However, it is Parliament that grants discharge; you make a recommendation. That is why we also had a nice debate again yesterday as part of the negotiations on the Financial Regulation. We need an interpretation of Article 319 of the Treaty, and of Article 335 – autonomy of the institutions. We have tabled proposals in this regard. However, it would be up to you to make a statement on these.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for their methodical work and excellent reports. In the present economic and financial crisis, the pressure on government finances has never been greater. Efficient use of public money is more important than ever. At the same time, our role as the European Parliament is to render account to the public and we must confirm that taxpayers’ money is being used correctly, transparently and efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="el">Given that political cohesion is at the heart of the debate on the error rate and its impact on the EU budget, it is vital that we underline what is an error and what is not: an error is a transaction that is not in keeping overall with current regulations. An error does not mean that resources have been lost or wasted or that fraud has been committed.</p>
      <p sl="el">With targeted efforts by the Commission and certain Member States, the error rate can be reduced significantly. I am sure that everyone will agree that, during the next cohesion policy programming period, there should be a greater degree of simplification, transparency and responsibility, with controls that marry efficiency with cost, as this will ultimately help us to improve how we protect the financial interests of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">During last year’s discharge procedure, we tried and, in my opinion, we managed to increase transparency and tighten up the administration of the budget. That, of course, does not mean that everything is perfect and that there is no margin for improvement and that there are no problems whatsoever. However, we are trying to identify and address the problems. In the current major economic and social crisis, the importance of monitoring has become more significant than ever and all of us – the European Parliament, the Commission, the European Court of Auditors and every other body – must be determined to address and resolve the problems in order to achieve even better results.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the 2010 budget and the European Court of Auditor’s report in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">This report contains both encouraging and less encouraging elements. Firstly, with regard to the funds that are directly controlled as well as managed by the Commission, it can be seen that the error rate is falling. This is the case in agricultural policy in particular, where an encouraging result was achieved with a 2.3% error rate.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, in cohesion policy, which has been a problem area for many years, we have an error rate of 7.7% – and two thirds of these errors should have been rectified by the Member States. That should not allow us to cease in our attempts to influence the Member States in this regard to ensure that the error rate is reduced.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I would like first of all – on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, but also as committee chair – to thank Commissioner Šemeta as well as the President of the European Court of Auditors most sincerely for their excellent cooperation. I expressly agree with those Members who welcome the fact that the Council is also here today, represented by Mr Wammen from the Danish Presidency. The cooperation with the Commission and the European Court of Auditors is exemplary. The cooperation with the Council, Mr Wammen, is in need of improvement – and it is on the part of the Council that this improvement is required. I would like to ask and encourage you to pass that message on to the other members of the Council, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Parliament, we expect an improvement in use of funds for which we have shared responsibility, and for the Council now to accommodate Parliament here in the trialogue so that in future, we can reduce the error rate. After all, we must also finally make some progress on the discharge of the Council. It is not acceptable for there to be public expenditure that is not subject to any democratic scrutiny. ‘No taxation without representation’ was the battle cry of the American Revolution. Democracy requires there to be no public expenditure without democratic scrutiny. You mentioned the principle of reciprocity, but that is clearly not appropriate in terms of the relationship between the Council and Parliament, as the Treaty of Lisbon clearly stipulates that the Council recommends, but Parliament decides. That is not reciprocity; it is not symmetry, but asymmetry. Here it is important for Parliament, as the directly elected body of the citizens, to have its rights upheld.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I support the idea of a special budgetary control commissioner. I would not support this idea were it not for the fact that we have to create an additional commissioner post, as we will soon have a new Member State, namely Croatia. If we have to have this post, then let us create it for this area, as the citizens of European Union Member States pay a lot of attention to the money spent by the European Union, its agencies and its Member States. This is the first point.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second point is that we may have different opinions: some of us want an increase in the budget and the budgets of the agencies, while others are against. Yet everybody agrees that conflicts of interest are absolutely unacceptable and these issues have to be clarified once and for all and put to rest so that everything is transparent and crystal clear. Otherwise, the authority of European Union institutions will decline, as too will the authority of our Parliament, which will be unable to respond to this problem decisively.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have lost count. Is this the 17th year in which the auditors have failed to give a positive declaration on the EU’s budget or, in other words, have we now reached 17 years in which taxpayers’ money has not been properly accounted for? I note the statement in the resolution on the discharge of the Commission budget that progress has been made since the resignation of the Santer Commission, but I have to ask: ‘Really?’</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2008, Commissioner Mandelson was accused of a conflict of interest after holidaying with a Russian oligarch whose company subsequently benefited from his department’s decisions. In June 2011, Commission President Barroso ran up a EUR 25 000 hotel bill for a four-night luxury stay in New York. Then there was the Commission memo issued by DG Trade in 2009 which encouraged officials to conceal information from public scrutiny. The EU and its institutions have failed to practise what they preach and what places them above the citizens they purport to represent. It is time the UK left this mess.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to touch on a question regarding the report on the European Institute for Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="en">Paragraph 3 proposes the merger of the European Institute for Gender Equality and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Gender equality is a founding value of the European Union and has implications broader than simply those of human rights. I have to say that these two bodies have completely different objectives. The Institute for Gender Equality was planned over more than 10 years. The initiative for it came from this Parliament, and after long preparations, it started work in 2010. I have not heard anything to suggest that its work has been inefficient. The main argument is that of saving resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this House, we often speak about greater integration in the European Union, in order to bring it closer to our citizens. Agencies, institutes, other EU bodies and the Member States all help us to deliver the message of the European Union. To have more Europe in every Member State is our goal. These bodies contribute a great deal to both EU and national policies. If we are concerned with saving resources, we need to talk about reform in a broader sense, systematically, and not only merely in terms of merging some of the EU institutions or agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">When we talk about savings, we can talk about Strasbourg and about other things, but money is not always what is at issue. There are certain things that we deliver to our citizens, and I think that having this kind of agency in Member States is crucial. I call on you to vote today not to merge these institutions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, when we talk about the discharge procedure, we are automatically talking about the use of European money and about us having to pay much closer attention to the way in which European money is used. I was the rapporteur for the report on protecting the European Union’s financial interests, and I agree that European money must be used with the utmost care, particularly at a time of crisis, but even during times of economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, there is a yawning chasm between this situation and turning the budget discharge procedure into a stage for the rapporteur to parade on and engage in self-promotion. I would say that there is a disproportionate political reaction between what is going on in the European agencies and what the rapporteur would like the actual situation to be.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the rapporteur, Monica Macovei, is only after self-promotion because we have both the procedures and tools we need to resolve problems promptly when they occur. I believe that this is an overhyped political reaction, and Ms Macovei is only seeking to raise her own profile.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there are currently 32 European agencies employing 5 500 people, with operating costs of about EUR 700 million. There is no doubt that their activities are, in large part, justified: after all, they carry out work on behalf of European institutions and facilitate the decision-making process, as well as discharging the Union’s obligations, as in the case of Frontex, which protects our borders. Even so, it is necessary to review how they function and, in particular, the rules by which they operate as regards conflicts of interest, since many examples of the latter have come to light in recent years. This issue could undermine the credibility of the assessments, expert opinions and certificates issued by some agencies and, as a result, undermine the authority of the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The financial policies of agencies should also be reviewed. Some of them, such as, for example, the Human Rights Agency in Vienna, are incapable of using their budgets and hastily spend most of their funds in the final month of the year, or else try to carry funds over to the following year. Consideration should be given to the future appointment of a temporary committee in Parliament to review the operations of agencies both from the point of view of the grounds for their existence as a separate entity and as regards their operational rules and, in particular, issues concerning conflicts of interest, impartiality or leaks of confidential information. These are very important issues. There should certainly be a debate about what constitutes a conflict of interest in order both to ensure high standards for agency employees and to ensure procedural transparency. We have to remember that, at a time of economic crisis, when budgetary restraint is expected of Member States, it is particularly important that the European Union should manage its resources carefully and reduce waste or irregularities and even fraud.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising that EU agencies, including the Agency for Human Rights, are of fundamental importance when it comes to achieving the aims and policies of the EU. Despite the fact that they account for just 1% of the EU budget, they are of unquestionable benefit to Member State citizens.</p>
      <p sl="sk">In connection with the discharge for the Agency for Fundamental Rights, however, I think it is necessary to emphasise that, if the agency is to continue functioning and to develop its activities as effectively as possible, it must adopt a number of measures to help it overcome the main problems relating to budgetary activities, expenditure, project funding and staff recruitment. The claims about alleged harassment of employees are also of great concern, although a case has already been brought in relation to this. It is now therefore necessary for the agency to give an adequate response to these allegations and clarify the handling of informers, because it is not clear that existing regulations on the protection of informers have been applied consistently, and the agency should have informed the European Parliament about this and submitted a written report. Budget planning is another negative aspect. The agency should also make improvements in this regard. The high volume of transferred funds is causing concern and the Court of Auditors has repeatedly drawn attention to this already.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, we are now talking about the budget for 2010, its surveillance and the granting of discharge.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The general public has a right to know what their taxes are being spent on. The use of public funds must be transparent and open.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I speak on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and I would like to raise one issue in connection with the future. It is important that we know how the external relations budget is being used. The Commission and the Council could consider making it possible, even on a daily and weekly basis, to follow online the movement of development cooperation funds and all money in the external relations budget. That is the modern approach, and a way for people to be able to see what good comes of the use of the taxes that they pay, in the poor regions of Africa, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would also like to mention a problem, which does not concern the external relations budget, it is true, but is a problem, nevertheless. It is quite incredible how, over the last six years, the Commission has disregarded commonly agreed rules and kept Parliament in the dark about the use of Council funds.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on the 2010 discharge, and I wanted to talk about the European Institute for Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="it">The year 2010 was especially significant for this institute, because it became financially independent. Therefore, two years since achieving financial independence, 92.3% of the posts in terms of the human resources of this institute have been filled, and it is now fully up and running.</p>
      <p sl="it">The institute plays a central role in identifying measures to resolve the considerable discrimination against women, in particular, by carrying out studies and research, drawing up statistics, and exchanging best practices in equal opportunities within the 27 Member States of Europe. The institute currently plays a fundamental role for the various Member States and the European Commission, which are evaluating the introduction of legislation on increasing the number of women involved in corporate decision making. Its work is therefore crucial.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am therefore against the request to consider the merger of the institute in Vilnius with the European Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna. These two institutes have totally different roles – as I have said, the institute in Vilnius deals with equal opportunities issues while the agency in Vienna focuses on human rights – so I call on all my fellow Members to support the amendment for the abolition of paragraph 3.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Day in, day out, our citizens are listening to alternating stories about growth and savings, and that is why agencies which are extremely important for Member States should also focus on their own consumption, on reducing their own costs, and on making savings.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I support the position adopted by the rapporteur, my colleague Monica Macovei, who is definitely one of the most appropriate people to deal with postponing the budget discharge for the European Environment Agency, as well as for the EFSA and EMA. This action must be taken in order to clarify and remedy the problems identified in their financial management.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am thinking particularly about the presence of conflicts of interest, which is a problem at both EU level and in Member States, including Romania. Decisions made in such situations are against the public interest and result in the inappropriate use of taxpayers’ money.

I have also heard calls for the Court of Auditors to submit as soon as possible its report on conflicts of interest in the agencies. I had already pointed this out in writing to this institution on several occasions: rest assured that you will have this report.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members who participated in this fruitful debate. Your contributions demonstrate the will of the discharge authority to contribute to more effective budget execution, aiming not only to meet policy objectives but also to ensure that financial support reaches those who need it most. This is a question of effectiveness, fairness and justice. Moreover, the European budget is the most concrete expression of the solidarity among European people and, therefore, it deserves the utmost care and commitment on the part of those managing and controlling it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Improving the EU’s financial governance is a demanding task involving many stakeholders and financial actors. At the forefront are the citizens of Europe and the benefits they derive from EU-financed projects and programmes. Their interests and the protection of EU taxpayers’ money are the main drivers for our ambitions and our efforts to improve the financial management of the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next, we have the financial actors. The Commission is fully committed to endorsing its final responsibility regarding implementation of the budget. But the effective involvement of all financial actors, without exception, and their commitment to value for money and sound financial management are instrumental to further reducing the risk of errors. In this respect, more effort is needed, in particular, on the effectiveness of control and management systems, but also on the transparency and accountability of the European and national authorities in charge of ensuring optimal use of EU money.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the Commission will endeavour to keep this Parliament, as discharge authority, fully informed of the execution of the European budget. It will therefore continue to provide the necessary information in the accounts and via the various reports announced during the hearings of the Commissioners responsible. Moreover, the Member States’ annual summaries, accompanied by an analysis and guidelines, will be transmitted in a user-friendly manner to the Committee on Budgetary Control in accordance with the provisions of Article 319 of the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several concrete questions were raised during this debate, and I would like to reply to them. Ms Ivanova raised the issue of outstanding commitments, and I can only agree that the outstanding commitments need to be substantially reduced. Therefore, the Commission has proposed an appropriate level of payments for the 2013 budget. Then Mr van de Camp raised the issue of external funds in relation to the Schengen Information System (SIS I and SIS II). You will know that many difficulties were encountered in the past in the development of this system. It is now operational and the Commission is carefully monitoring it to ensure it functions in an effective and reliable manner. The Commission is ready to report on it if requested to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the funds for external borders, the Commission can execute the allocated budget when we receive claims from the Member States. I will pass your concerns on to my fellow Commissioner in charge of this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you, namely Mr Berman, Ms Hohlmeier, Mr Schmidt and Ms Jäätteenmäki, raised the issue of the status of the European Development Fund (EDF). In the financial framework for 2014-2020, the Commission has proposed keeping the same setting, i.e. outside the Union budget, but it has also made a clear commitment to assess all other options for the financial period post-2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were, of course, many points made about the agencies, and I would like to say a few words regarding the Food Safety Authority, in response to Mr Bové. The Commission regrets the appointment of Ms Diána Bánáti as an executive director of the International Life of Science Institute, as that position is clearly incompatible with her role at the EU Food Safety Authority. The Commission will decide with the Council on the next steps to be taken to replace Ms Bánáti.</p>
      <p sl="en">For the future, I want to inform you that the interinstitutional working group on traditional agencies, in which Parliament is participating, has addressed the need to develop a consistent policy on preventing conflicts of interest for staff, advisers, experts and board members. This work has to be done in the working group and I hope it will produce an appropriate solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I want to assure you that the Commission will address all other measures and actions included in the discharge resolution to be adopted today. Many of these measures have already been proposed in the review of the Financial Regulation and in the legal bases for the next financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will also invite all the other parties actively concerned to join our efforts and to share our objective of further improving the execution of the EU budget.</p>

I hope that our two institutions can soon enter into a lasting agreement on an updated discharge procedure. It is high time that we found a solution together.</p>
      <p sl="da">As I mentioned in my introductory speech, as long ago as March 2011, the Council tabled a proposal for a memorandum of understanding for cooperation between Parliament and the Council during the annual discharge procedure. This memorandum contains specific proposals for how we can exchange the necessary information and documents in a way that respects the respective roles of our institutions in the procedure. I would therefore like to make it clear today that the Council’s proposal is not an ultimatum. It is clear that we must get the negotiations under way between our institutions in order to reach an agreement, and I therefore hope that Parliament will soon be able to establish a negotiating delegation so that we can get started on the work. We all need to be aware of our responsibility and play our part in finding a solution. We owe this to European taxpayers in particular, who are entitled to see us work together to find an effective and lasting way to keep our institutions’ expenditure under control.</p>
      <p sl="da">It is not the time for fighting between institutions; instead, it is time for cooperating and for showing our citizens that we can enter into compromises and deliver results. I therefore hope that very soon, we will be able to sit together around the negotiating table.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am sorry that I could not be here for the whole debate. I am very happy that the Danish Presidency is here – they are in other places as well having trialogues – but I have followed the debate extensively.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem here is shared management, and shared management is exactly the same as it was when I was a kid and my sister and I had the shared responsibility of cleaning the house. Nobody cleaned the house and then we stood there blaming each other. The problem is not all over the place. It is in Structural Funds and in all Member States. 60% of the errors come from three Member States: 31% from Spain, 18% from Italy and 10% from the UK. 58% of the errors could have been corrected by Member States, according to the Court of Auditors. I think it is high time that the Council debates this amongst themselves; it is your taxpayers, it is your money.</p>
      <p sl="en">That does not mean that the Commission is without responsibility. They have the responsibility to control and sanction those who do not play by the rules. I ask myself: does the Commission not have the tools to do that? Or do you not use the tools that you have? My response has been that it is a combination. You lack some tools, but you do not use the tools which you have effectively enough. Therefore, we have a responsibility in the upcoming programming period to give you the tools which you need now when we are colegislators. That goes for the Council as well. But we demand of you, as a part of this discharge procedure, to use the tools you have more effectively.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reason that I decided to propose to grant discharge is because I heard your sincere wish to change the way you work with sanctions, suspensions and interruptions, and that is the reason we give you discharge. If, next year, we do not see any change, then it is a whole new deal. However, I think that we are on the right track and I am happy that you have been listening to the recommendations we have given in our resolution. I think that it is a good basis for improving the situation for next year.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the agencies have indeed been a very controversial topic in this debate, and therefore I would like to use my second lot of speaking time to talk about these agencies very briefly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms Haug is right to say that the agencies have been very strongly criticised over the last seven years or more. In my opinion, however, this criticism has been justified. There is duplication of work, there are questionable decisions with regard to locations, there are questions in relation to the legal basis in primary law, there are oversized management boards, and many more issues besides. Thus, there are some very urgent questions that need to be raised here. These are clearly horizontal questions, I realise that.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, new questions have now arisen with regard to three specific agencies. These relate to conflicts of interest – not just one conflict of interest, but several. There are also unresolved questions relating to tendering procedures, and there are questions concerning the squandering of taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, it is up to each individual Member to decide whether or not to grant discharge. However, I would like to remind the House that we recently had some very serious cases of corruption here in this House, and that is precisely why this House has an obligation here – it really has an obligation – to deal adequately with conflicts of interests. I would also like to recall – and I should perhaps direct this comment to Mr Geier – that the decision we are to take today is not whether to refuse discharge.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are deciding today whether to postpone discharge. In other words, it is a question of whether we have a bit more time, or whether the agency has a bit more time to answer the questions that are still outstanding. For this reason, I very much believe that every Member has an obligation here to allow this extra time, and I would therefore also like to ask for support for Ms Macovei’s proposal. I think she has done an excellent job and, in this regard, I would also like to compliment her on her work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Ehrenhauser, that fits in very nicely inasmuch as I can answer your question straight away.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is quite clear to me that, at this juncture, it is not a question of refusing discharge. However, if the rapporteur for the discharge in respect of the agencies raises accusations against the agencies, some of which lie outside the responsibility of these institutions, because the staffing of certain bodies, which you rightly described as excessive, is the responsibility of the Member States, then in October, the only option will be to refuse discharge, because this situation will not have changed, because the Member States will not have altered their behaviour with regard to the agencies. Therefore, the political instrument is not the appropriate one.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament really is now the last not to take the conflicts of interest seriously. The case just mentioned by Commissioner Šemeta is one that once again throws some pertinent light on the situation. However, the problem will not be resolved by postponing discharge. In committee, I have repeatedly argued that, to resolve the issue, we must wait for the report from the European Court of Auditors, which President Caldeira has, thankfully, informed us about, in order to reach conclusions based on a more thorough knowledge of the facts, which we can then also discuss in a serious debate.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am on the point of making accusations about certain situations, such as the issue that you also mentioned concerning the choice of seats of the agencies. In a press statement, I myself have criticised the fact that the UK Government is forcing one agency to establish its offices in Canary Wharf. That is the most expensive property market that the European Union has to offer. This is the same government that is proposing that the EU make savings. It really must start with its own decisions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thus, with regard to the question of whether the criticism is justified, there is far less disagreement than there perhaps appears to be. The arguments relate to the question of what the political response to this should be.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will try to answer and to sum up the debate. I would like to start by saying that the work has changed and we must follow these changes. Transparency and proper management of conflicts of interest has become vital for both governments and our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, conflicts of interest – I repeat what I said this morning – must be a criterion in the discharge procedure for all the EU institutions. I repeat that in particular for our Socialist colleagues. The discharge procedure is the place to evaluate conflicts of interest because, if they are not correctly managed, conflicts of interest can distort the allocation of public resources and human resources policies, and can lead to public funds being wasted. So, yes, this is the place to discuss it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Once again, we took this opportunity to call on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to revise the way they appoint members of the management boards of the agencies, as well as the directors. I am glad to hear from Commissioner Šemeta today that this will be taken into account and the policy revised. This will only help the agencies. I believe that the postponement will also help the agencies to finish the clearing, or at least to have in place, in an irreversible way, a structured policy against conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will not respond to the personal criticism from the Socialists. I would just like to say that I have not heard any concrete argument as to why discharge for the three agencies should not be postponed. Once again, this is nothing to do with the work of the agencies. This is not going against the agencies. Rather, it is to help the agencies, and also to increase people’s trust in the work of the agencies and of Parliament, to see that we take it seriously when we carry out the discharge. We do not put stamps on some other reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I am grateful to all of you for this debate and for the discussion we have had, including those who criticised my proposals. I am very glad that the conflict of interest issue was the subject of such a large debate. I am sure that this will continue.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to encourage my colleagues to vote in favour of the report adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control concerning discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) for 2010. I would also like to urge my colleagues to support the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in which we proposed deleting from the resolution attached to Parliament’s decision the proposal to consider in future merging the European Institute for Gender Equality and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Having assessed the importance of this institute for promoting the implementation of gender mainstreaming in the policies of the European Union and its Member States, as well as its efforts to ensure gender equality in Member State labour markets and raise awareness of this issue among citizens, we cannot vote for the abolition of this institute in the future. Gender equality is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, reaffirmed in the Europe 2020 strategy and all of its implementing instruments. Progressive thinking should not even allow us to consider such a possibility. Compared to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, EIGE’s mandate is unique because it concerns the control of de facto equality between women and men, meaning practical equality between women and men in all areas of life, established in EU policies. On the other hand, the mandate of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights concerns legal equality.</p>

      <p sl="cs">I would like, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, to stress the importance of Report No 7/2011 of the European Court of Auditors, entitled ‘Is agri-environment support well designed and managed?’, and our recommendations (items 74-83) contained in the report. Agri-environment measures are an important EU policy, and the EU funds allocated for these payments in 2007-2013 amount to EUR 22.2 billion. Agri-environment payments have been part of the EU's rural development policy since 2000, and the Commission shares management of them with the Member States. The Commission evaluates and approves rural development programmes which the Member States draw up and submit. The aim of the payments is to motivate farmers to use methods compatible with protecting and improving the environment.</p>
      <p sl="cs">According to the Court of Auditors, the agri-environment policy was not set up in such a way as to bring specific benefits to the environment. The aims of agri-environment payments are not sufficiently specific for it to be possible to assess their achievement, the stated environmental problems do not represent a clear justification for the provision of agri-environment payments, and it is not easy to monitor fulfilment of the policy. It follows from this that Member States should establish clearly targeted rural development programmes, and that the Commission should assess the programmes more rigorously prior to approval. In this context, it is essential to focus the agri-environment regimes on more specific priorities in the next programming period. Agri-environment payments can achieve the desired effects in the areas of biodiversity, the preservation and development of agricultural and forestry systems with natural value, water protection and the fight against climate change.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Implementing the 2010 budget was a challenge, as it was the first full year of operation of our new Statute for Members and Statute for Assistants, in addition to the changes to the implementing rules for both statutes, which proved a significant additional burden for Parliament’s administrative services. Nevertheless, the EP budget was implemented in accordance with the principles of good financial management, which was confirmed by the European Court of Auditors. The Court found no serious breaches when assessing the compliance of the system of controls and supervision with the Financial Regulation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this context, I very much welcomed the opening in 2011 of the Visitor Centre, which has already been visited by over 100 000 citizens. At the same time, I would like to suggest that a study be carried out after it has been in operation for 12 months to gauge public reaction and also to assess the costs and benefits of the centre and to consider the profitability of this investment. I do not, however, agree with the criticism levelled at EuroparlTV, which I personally consider to be a successful project, although it is still too early to evaluate it as it is still in its pilot phase.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As regards the discharge for 2010, I am very concerned by Parliament’s expenditure on its seat in Strasbourg, which amounted to EUR 51 500 000 in 2010, as well as the costs already incurred for the KAD building in Luxembourg and those forecast over the next 20 years, which exceed EUR 800 000.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The first surprise that strikes me, even after just a cursory read of today’s agenda, is the ridiculously large number of European agencies there are. Parliament is dealing today with 43 discharge reports relating to as many European institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At this time when it is vital to use public money prudently, Parliament should scrutinise rigorously the benefit of, and need for, these agencies. For instance, I welcome the idea of merging CEPOL and EUROPOL. I believe that other similar solutions could also be found.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This analysis is especially necessary in light of the extremely serious suspicions concerning the way in which public money is spent in these agencies and the potential conflicts of interest. I am going to vote to postpone discharge for certain agencies. This action does not resolve the problems mentioned. However, I believe that it can provide a starting point for a meticulous examination of the way in which this excessive number of agencies at EU level operate, and of their costs and benefit.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I would like to express my opposition to the proposal to merge the European Institute for Gender Equality and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, included in the discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget for 2010. Such a proposal is based on saving money and the desire to avoid the duplication of activities. I would like to draw my colleagues’ attention to the fact that the two institutions have different objectives. This institute was established because certain tasks related to gender equality were not dealt with by existing institutions. The tasks of the European Institute for Gender Equality are unique, including the areas of coordination, centralisation and dissemination of research data and information, network building, increasing the visibility of equality between men and women, etc. The institute was only established in 2007 and the recruitment of staff was only recently completed. The institute can finally carry out its functions effectively and I therefore believe that it is irrational and unreasonable to transform it.</p>

Following fruitful cooperation between the three institutions, I believe we have reached our common objective and a good and reasonable outcome which the Commission can accept.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Commission would like to make a declaration on the external representation aspects to ensure that the provisions are interpreted in coherence with the Treaty and to avoid legal uncertainty. The declaration states, and I quote: ‘The Commission observes that the title of Article 5 refers to the participation of the Union in the Convention, whereas paragraph 1 speaks more broadly of participation in the Convention, which shall be a joint responsibility of the Commission and the Member States. It recalls that the Commission represents the Union, under Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union, in areas that do not come under the common foreign and security policy. Accordingly, the Commission considers that the joint responsibility of the Commission and the Member States mentioned in Article 5(1) does not refer to the representation of the Union, as could possibly be derived from the title. Rather, Article 5(1) must be interpreted in the light of the division of competences between the Union and the Member States established by the Treaties’.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, this document concentrates on the importance of regional airports as potential vehicles of territorial, economic and social cohesion. These infrastructures can, and must, perform this role, especially for citizens living outside major urban areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">The rule whereby the threshold for an airport to receive State aid was decreased to 200 000 passengers per year is good. Regional aviation can ensure that free movement in Europe is a reality not just for people living in major capital cities, but also for European citizens living outside of these areas, ensuring that these cities and regions enjoy not only the benefits brought about by greater mobility, but also by generating tourism.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my capacity as rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on regional airports, and I am sure it will serve as a basis for their further regulation.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report shows the importance that the European Parliament attributes to these airports in the context of air transport and the important role that they play as a vehicle for territorial, economic and social cohesion within the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">For the first time, the definition of a regional airport has been provided and an attempt has been made to limit the area of reference by sub-dividing regional airports into major and minor airports, also in relation to passenger throughput and the links provided by such airports.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is certainly to be hoped that the Commission will then follow up with more stringent specifications for their definition. A special passage concerns recognition of the need to guarantee public service obligations for remote regions, islands and the outermost regions, as we are well aware of their handicap in terms of participation in the single market.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I believe that the definition establishing and specifying the negative view of the irrational proliferation of further regional airports is useful.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the model presently used for airports in many Member States encourages the concentration of central structures in major airports, thereby creating a radial structure. That is the case with Madrid airport, which sidelines the airports of my region, Galicia. This model therefore encourages centralism.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Small airports should be seen as economic agents that socially and territorially link regions. These airports should be wholly managed as a network that follows a radial but not centralised system; that is polycentric; that enables various air routes to be diversified on the basis of complementarity and interdependence between airports and railways, so that peripheral areas – areas considered socio-economically peripheral – will cease to be peripheral.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are important for improving Europe’s links and allowing its citizens to move around inside the Union, but these structures must be built and operated according to the European Union’s own environmental standards. We cannot allow air traffic, and with it regional airports, to further harm the European environment, our air quality and the well-being of our region.</p>
      <p sl="it">In northern Italy, for example – I am thinking of the cities of Treviso and Verona – the airport structures have been expanded in recent years without due consideration for the contexts in which these airports operate on a daily basis. More air connections in Europe are fine, but not at the cost of Europe’s environment, air and land.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on the future of regional airports and air services in the EU because it lays down concrete formulae for optimising the use of these infrastructures, committing to their integration as a key element in European transport planning.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are especially pleased with the strengthening of these airports’ intermodal connections – essentially rail and road connections – in order to avoid saturation at other more congested airports. Furthermore, the report includes contributions that are very important to us, such as how regional airports are treated in terms of goods transport by air. I believe, moreover, that it prevents ridiculous amounts of waste, such as we saw in Spain at Castellón and Guadalajara airports.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, it offers concrete solutions to the problems presented by unacceptable behaviour on the part of low-cost airlines such as the ‘one bag’ rule or the controversy over the State aid they receive to operate in some airports. We are also totally in agreement with the treatment of airports in the outermost regions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regional airports are essential transport nodes and factors that contribute to growth and territorial cohesion. Frequently, however, they only survive thanks to massive injections of public money. Nowadays, this is increasingly scarce, and therefore it is important that they should have a specific vocation in order to avoid a proliferation that would lead to non-utilisation or under-utilisation of the airport infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="it">A typical example of this is the scores of airports in northern Italy located just 20-30 kilometres from one another. At the moment, there is no precise definition for a regional airport, and the Commission should therefore set common criteria for a proper definition.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I am concerned about the formulation regarding the scope of application and, in particular, the exclusion of airports whose principal catchment area is a capital city. I do not think it is correct as a catchment area is not uniform and can change. Despite these critical points, I voted in favour in order to draw the Commission’s attention to these important airports.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I supported the most important arguments in the report on regional airports in the European Union. For regions such as my own Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodeship, the development of the airport in Bydgoszcz provides an opportunity for considerably greater mobility for local inhabitants and for many businesses to grow. It is also essential if greater numbers of tourists are to visit the region and visit attractive towns such as Toruń, Grudziądz or Chełmno. It also provides opportunities to regions such as Kujawy, Pałuki or Bory Tucholskie. I am speaking about this because, in this context, I would expect the European Commission to increase significantly the funds available for the development of regional airports. These airports should also receive assistance on a broader scale from their own countries.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I hardly need to emphasise the importance of regional airports. I abstained in the vote on this report because I have a problem with the definition of regional airports. The description given here, namely, to not include ‘airports whose principal catchment area is a capital city’ in the purview of this report, means that numerous smaller airports with relatively low passenger numbers would not be classed as regional airports. These include, for example, Lyon and Dresden, Prague, Dublin, Liège and even Luxembourg. In my opinion, work needs to be done here to find a suitable definition that is more in line with reality.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I voted for this report because I support the need to create a functioning transport network in the European Union. This would make a substantial economic contribution and make travelling more flexible and safer. Regional airports and airline services are vital both for ensuring free movement and for developing the economy and local tourism. In light of this, I should emphasise how important it is to overcome the barriers facing the European air transport sector. It is important that all citizens can enjoy greater mobility, a situation which regional aviation can help achieve. I should mention how important it is for regional airports to be integrated into the transport network in order to reduce the congestion from passenger traffic and improve operational efficiency. In Romania, efforts are being channelled towards the efficient use of the existing infrastructure and developing new regional airport projects.</p>

I share the concerns that my fellow Members have raised, for example, during this round of explanations of votes, even though I myself voted in favour, as I believe that regional airports are an important issue. It is also an important issue for my own country and for the different regions within Poland, where the development of regional airports could prove to be of critical importance in two respects: first of all, it could make tourism more attractive and increase tourism in these regions, which is a great opportunity for Poland. Secondly, the growth of regional airports also increases investment and economic opportunities in these regions in a wider sense. If it is possible to reach a city or a region by air, this can often prove decisive in terms of how attractive it is, even for investment. For this reason, I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I voted in favour of this report on the future of regional airports and air services in the EU. I particularly welcome the suggestion that those regional airports which are consistently running at low capacity could be used to relieve the congestion in the main hub airports which are severely congested as well. I feel that this would help to create a more efficient EU aviation area as well as addressing the specific regional aviation issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that better integration of regional airports into the transport network nationally and internationally really will bring added value in terms of encouraging other benefits for EU citizens. I also back the report’s claims that the imposing of heavy luggage restrictions, and especially the one bag rule imposed by some airlines and the addition of certain unavoidable charges, threatens revenue from vital retail sales at airports. This is particularly the case for regional airports, which often have to negotiate extremely competitive landing charges in order to attract airlines in the first place.</p>

      <p sl="fi">It is very important to ensure that in remoter areas, connections are maintained and that people can also continue to earn a living. This applies to both businesses and the mobility of people. Environmental factors are also important. When reforms are being carried out and the European Union is undergoing development, it is very important to remember the regional, social and economic aspects. In my opinion, this report takes very good account of them. It is important to ensure that there are also adequate transport links in sparsely populated areas in different parts of Europe. With the growth in air transport, it should also be ensured that air transport is an option at those regional airports, now and in the future.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Another reason is the fact that the Commission still supports what are, in my opinion, highly risky financial engineering instruments, and is even preparing for this in the next multiannual financial framework. In this case, I believe the criticism is well placed, as there are no clear rules here for the use of these financial instruments, and there are not even any rules on transparency.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I wanted to vote in favour of postponement in this report. I think that postponement is necessary because we encountered certain difficulties with the European Environment Agency. The problem is that the Executive Director has, at the same time, been a trustee of an NGO and has financed projects to the tune of more than EUR 30 000.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I see the same problem with discharge in respect of the European Food Safety Authority. Two members and several other employees are said to have connections with the food industry. I would also refer to management staff meeting expenses, which were three times higher than those of the agency that claimed the second greatest amount in expenses. I was hoping that postponement would mean that we would really be able to straighten things out, and so achieve transparency in European policy making.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my group is deeply concerned by the ever-growing size of the EU’s budget and its lack of efficiency and accountability. We are thus reluctant for discharge to be granted for any part of the European Union’s budget until the budget in its entirety is approved by the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given that this report proposes the granting of discharge, I voted against. Though the report calls for follow-ups of past audits to be included in the Court of Auditors’ future work programmes as a means of assessing progress – a proposal that my group backs – I cannot vote in favour of any discharge being granted until the budget as a whole has received a positive statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors.</p>
      <p sl="en">I thus generally voted in favour of the reports proposing postponement of discharge and against those that proposed the granting of discharge. A few exceptions included the Environment Agency, the Food Safety Authority and the European Medicines Agency, which is located in my London constituency. However, in general, I am extremely sceptical about the whole discharge process for the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I welcome the new roaming regulations as they will provide tangible benefits to millions of consumers. Mobile phone operators have a tendency to apply the highest regulated tariffs. In Romania, current prices are too high for ordinary citizens to purchase mobiles, and yet we live in an age of mobility. Access to information and communication is a necessity, not a luxury. Last year, there was a 12% drop in the number of roaming calls made by Romanians. As MEPs, we spend most of our time in Belgium or France, but we have phone numbers from our home countries. This is therefore a problem that affects us all, which is why I support, yet again, the regulations on data transfer. This means that I, too, will avoid getting any phone bill surprises when I return home. I should also stress that we need to make even greater efforts to limit the undesirable consequences of inadvertent roaming.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the potential afforded by the new channels of communication is huge. In a world in which everything is digital, information is an asset for every European citizen.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Union needs to protect all end users and try to reduce the existing disparities between Member States on the European market to a minimum. I would like to point out that, as the promoter of a single internal market, the European Union must also implement an internal telecommunications market. The significant differences between domestic and roaming prices obviously make these difficult goals to meet.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with Ms Niebler’s proposal. Each home provider must give customers clear and adequate information about the levels of consumption they have reached and agreed. Transparent information about the conclusion of contracts and the charges for data roaming services will be an appropriate means for protecting European consumers and I therefore voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, along with the rest of the ECR Group, I voted in favour of this report on roaming on public mobile communications networks. I believe that it is very important that the current gap between roaming and national telecom tariffs should be reduced, and I believe that the suggestions made in this report will make this happen.</p>
      <p sl="en">Separating the sale of roaming services from the sale of national tariffs will mean that customers will be able to purchase roaming services from a provider other than the one which provides their national tariff. This will encourage more competition in the EU market. Keeping in place the price caps for retail and wholesale will also serve to offer opportunities for new entrants to the roaming market, which again I think is extremely important for our citizens. This is a rare, tangible example of where we can show the public that the EU is really doing something positive for our electorates.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I was responsible for this regulation on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I naturally voted in favour of it. These days, we are not accustomed to expecting good news from the European Union, but this regulation that we have voted on is one piece of good news for EU consumers because it will be cheaper for them to use their mobile phones next summer. The regulation is to enter into force at the start of July and will cut price ceilings to at least half their current levels by 2014. It will introduce requirements for structural changes. From the beginning of 2014, consumers will be able to choose, if they so wish, a separate roaming operator, in addition to their home operator.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The regulation will also impose an obligation on telephone operators to inform consumers by text message when they are approaching the price ceilings that they themselves have set, even when they are outside the EU. In this way, we aim to prevent bill shock, something that has been unsettling EU citizens in recent years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Some telephone operators have already acknowledged this necessity in the past year and have offered their customers cheap roaming packages. When structural changes take effect, there is good reason to hope that prices will come down with the creation of markets, and that new price caps will no longer need to be set in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for consumers across Europe who have been through tough times over the last number of years, today’s vote to cap roaming charges on text, phone and data charges will be a small piece of good news. As a result of our actions today, on 1 July, consumers can expect to see a reduction in their phone bills when they travel in Europe. The extension to include capping of data roaming charges will not only be a boost to holidaymakers but to those travelling on business. I am sure many of us can remember some very nasty experiences with the cost of data roaming and data download while working abroad. So, hopefully, families and businesses across Europe will no longer face the prospect of being ripped off every time they use their phones abroad and return to find astronomical bills waiting on them.</p>
      <p sl="en">While caps may be effective in the short term, I also welcome the structural measures in the legislation which aim to stimulate better competition in the EU roaming market-place. That will hopefully deliver a well-functioning competitive market-place, which is the right solution to solve this problem in the longer term. By opening up market access to competitors and by decoupling roaming services from national providers, competition will hopefully improve and drive down prices even more. Good news in time for summer holidaymakers.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution. More and more people are using various types of Internet-enabled mobile communication devices. The use of tablets or smartphones is widespread. Problems usually appear when they are used in areas covered by other operators, or, in other words, when travelling abroad. If the European Union is to be an area without internal borders, the very existence of roaming does not appear to have any justification. I am therefore wholeheartedly in favour of actions aimed at practically eliminating this practice over the coming few years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An interesting solution at present is the proposal to sell separate roaming services, which would enable customers to select an alternative roaming operator. The new table of charges being proposed for the next two years looks attractive, particularly as regards data transmission. A reasonable level of retail and wholesale prices should provide some protection to consumers against unexpectedly high bills for telecommunications services.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the roaming issue is very important and significant. This is one part of our work that European citizens will actually follow, and they will see the practical effects of our work reflected in their telephone bills.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we speak about mobility in the European Union and actually try to strengthen the European internal market, it is very important that we also get closer to one another in telecommunications as a result of roaming charges. Very many European travellers have been surprised by how large their bills from different countries have been. Consequently, it will be good to find a more standardised system of charges in the common internal market area and thereby get closer to consumers.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is an excellent reform, and an excellent step in the right direction. Moreover, as we all know, this could still be improved by means of greater cooperation in the field of telecommunications, resulting in genuinely competitive and even lower charges throughout Europe, so that telecommunications are not a barrier to trade and human relations.</p>

The appalling situation of the Christians in the countries that experienced the so-called Arab Spring is only mentioned in passing, in that it states that Parliament insists that respect for democratic institutions and fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, freedom of association, and protection of religious minorities, be ensured. That is not enough! We must make it clear to these countries that they cannot treat the Christian minorities, which have been living there for hundreds of years, in the way that the Islamic fundamentalists, which are being elected to power and replacing the secular dictators that they overthrew, are currently doing, and that they cannot simply murder and kill these people.</p>
      <p sl="de">In Tahrir Square, Muslims and Christians stood side-by-side. Now, as a result of elections, majorities are appearing that no longer have anything to do with these protests. The Christians are the losers in this Arab Spring, and we must protect them. This is what this agreement is intended to be used for in the future.

Trade has always been one of the strongest pillars of the neighbourhood policy. Unlike various aspects of the common foreign policy, trade guarantees coherent action that brings benefits to Member States. The ‘more for more’ principle is the right way to establish wholly democratic rules for trade and economic policy, without the need to conclude agreements with oligarchs, as was the case in the past.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The governments of partner countries must, however, make a serious commitment to opening markets bilaterally.

This aspect must be preserved, with the decisions taken by the European Patent Office on the ‘broccoli’ and ‘tomato’ cases playing a useful role to this end.

At a time like the present, when uncontrolled relocations and the economic crisis are causing Western Europe serious difficulties, and all the basic principles of the common trade policy should be overhauled, the fact that the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) has decided to accept a claim from China against an article of the anti-dumping regulation applicable in the European Union, Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community, clearly demonstrates that on a global level, there is no desire to protect our production and industry, and that the Commission has still failed to understand that anti-protectionism does not benefit European businesses and consumers, but rather unfair conduct by third countries.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Dumping must be distinguished from simple practices of low-price sales resulting from lower costs or greater productivity. The key criterion in this respect is not, in fact, the relationship between the price of the exported product and that on the market of the country of import, but the relationship between the price of the exported product and its normal value. A product is therefore considered to be dumped if its export price to the European Union is less than the comparable price for a like product established in the ordinary course of trade within the exporting country. The application of any anti-dumping duty presupposes the presence of a second key element: significant material injury to an EU industry, be it injury caused to an industry established in the EU, the threat of injury or substantial retardation of the establishment of such an industry. I do not think that anti-dumping measures can be applied if it is considered not being in the EU’s interest to implement them. With this in mind, all EU interests must be taken into account as a whole, including those of EU industry, users and consumers. All stakeholders will have the opportunity to make their views known.</p>

This draft amendment has emerged following the adoption by the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the Appellate Body Report in the case ‘European Communities – Definitive Anti-Dumping Measures on Certain Iron or Steel Fasteners from China’, which pointed out inconsistencies between Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement.

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of the proposed amendment to this regulation, which the Committee on International Trade has decided to adopt using the simplified procedure, is to incorporate the decision of 28 July 2011 by the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) into EU legislation, specifically, the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation. The EU-China dispute resulted from the provision in EU legislation for discriminating against individual exporting producers in ‘non-market economy countries’, which breaches the rules of the WTO itself, specifically, the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement. This is significant. Examples of provisions being scrapped include those requiring that, in exporting producers, ‘the majority of the shares belong to private persons’. The purpose of this report is an amendment intended to bring EU legislation in line with the rules of the WTO, which is an organisation whose actions and principles we oppose. However, it remains significant and interesting to note how, in this case, the EU is overtaking the WTO itself in its overwhelming mercantilism and neoliberal fundamentalism.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Moreira’s report on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. In order to promote the development of world trade, the 27 Member States drew up a common trade policy with third countries in an attempt to abolish trade restrictions and excessive tariffs. This trade liberalisation does not imply the non-respect of rights and obligations by commercial partners operating on an international level. I believe it is crucial to apply real reforms and to be seriously committed to tackling problems relating to market distortions in order to ensure consistency between corporate conduct and the rules applying to free international competition.</p>

The issue as to whether or not it is contrary to the articles of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement to set a unified dumping margin and a unified anti-dumping duty for certain exports will depend on the specific circumstances. These can include the existence of corporate and structural links between exporters, such as common control, ownership and management, for example, as well as the existence of corporate and structural links between the state and exporters. On 19 January 2012, the EU and China agreed that a reasonable period of time for implementing the DSB recommendations and rulings would be 14 months and two weeks from the date on which the DSB adopted the report. The reasonable period of time will therefore expire on 12 October 2012. In order for the EU to be able to respect the reasonable period of time for implementing the DSB recommendations and rulings that were agreed between the EU and China, I consider it right and proper that the Committee on International Trade has adopted the motion for a resolution in simplified procedure.</p>

At this point, it is worth differentiating between dumping and the normal practice of selling products at low prices, where the low prices are a consequence of low production costs. It is therefore important that the anti-dumping measures used by the European Union should be applied fairly and objectively. Account should also be taken of the fact that tariff and trade wars could, under present circumstances, aggravate the current economic crisis. On the other hand, closing boundaries to external goods would be a mistake since, in the long term, such action leads to the shrinking of national economies.

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report because I believe that, since Russia became a World Trade Organisation (WTO) member last December, the EU has lost the right to apply quotas to imports of steel and such products from Russia. This regulation adopts European Union legislation according to Russia’s WTO accession. The European Commission estimates that this regulation represents approximately EUR 107 million per year in exports and that the EU steel sector will become more competitive due to reduced export duties. As such, implementing this legislation will bring economic opportunities to European producers, which is essential at a time of crisis and particularly in a market that is geographically close to us.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA), the European Community and the government of the Russian Federation concluded an ‘Agreement on trade in certain steel products’ in 2007, and set quotas. However, as you know, Russia recently joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), after almost 20 years of negotiations. We therefore no longer need to impose steel import quotas, particularly as keeping these quotas in force would constitute a violation of the WTO rules. That is good news for the international community, including the European Union itself. Indeed, the Commission estimates that additional European exports of iron and steel products will be worth approximately EUR 107 million per year.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted to repeal the regulation on administering restrictions on imports of certain steel products from the Russian Federation because maintaining volume limits for these imports breaches World Trade Organisation (WTO) regulations, given that the Russian Federation became a member of the WTO in 2011. I think that with Russia now being a member of the WTO, this will give a significant boost to trade between Russia and the European Union, and the situation will evolve in keeping with the existing provisions in bilateral agreements. This will enable the EU to enjoy freer access to the Russian market, thereby increasing the volume and value of exports. Furthermore, the decrease in export duties will increase competitiveness, which consumers will benefit from. I support the need for closer supervision and for lifting the other barriers still in place preventing trade between Russia and the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Bilateral relations between the European Union and the Russian Federation are based on the fundamental values and principles of democracy, human rights, legislation and the market economy, with its legal basis being provided by the partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA). The agreement came into force in 1997 for an initial period of 10 years, and has been automatically extended every year since 2007. This defines the main common objectives and institutional framework for bilateral contracts and calls for activities and dialogue in a number of areas. The provisions of the PCA are supplemented by a number of sectoral and international agreements, as well as by other cooperation mechanisms. Steel processing and textiles are the main sectors covered by bilateral trade agreements. The last steel agreement stipulated that it would be terminated if Russia became a member of the World Trade Organisation, which happened on 16 December 2011.

      <p sl="pt">On 1 December 1997, the partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, on the one part, and Russia, on the other part, entered into force, leading to the establishment of the Agreement on trade in certain steel products from the Russian Federation, pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2007. This report, by Mr Sturdy, concerns a new proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing the aforementioned regulation on administering certain restrictions on imports of certain steel products from the Russian Federation. Although the Russian Federation’s steel exports to the EU are significant, representing 24% of all imports of steel products, the PCA provided that the agreement would have to be repealed and the quota scrapped if Russia ever joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

However, the EU can expect to benefit from a more liberal access to the Russian market, which would stimulate competition and result in lower consumer prices. I voted in favour for these reasons.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. With the accession of Russia to the WTO in December 2011, the EU needs to align specific regulations it maintained bilaterally with the prevailing WTO law. One such regulation concerns quantitative limitations on imports of certain steel products, especially flat-rolled sheets, from Russia which have been in existence since 2007 (EC Regulation 1342/2007). Steel imports from Russia account for about 25% of all EU steel imports, half of which are semi-finished products input into the EU steel industry. In turn, half of this half has so far been subject to import quotas (around 1.5 million tonnes of steel). Quantitative restrictions were in place to protect the EU steel industry. The end of quantitative import restrictions will reshuffle the EU’s steel industry landscape somewhat, since Russian flat-rolled sheets are less expensive than sheets made in the EU. However, this will be compensated for by better access to steel scrap from Russia and lower tariffs for EU exports of finished steel products to Russia.</p>

      <p sl="it">My vote in favour of this measure is not just a duty. In actual fact, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules require the European Union to remove the rules imposing restrictions on the import of products from other members of the WTO. Since Russia has now become a member of the WTO, unless we had voted to repeal certain rules today, we would have been subject to certain sanctions which would have damaged our production and our businesses.</p>

      <p sl="it">Since Russia became a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on 16 December 2011, the EU no longer has the right to apply steel import quotas according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2007, and therefore preserving these quotas would constitute a violation of the WTO rules and expose the European Union to legal action from the Russian side. I voted for the text, as it is very likely that with the repeal of the European regulation, the European Union can expect to benefit from a more liberal market access to the Russian iron and steel sector. There will still be minor restrictions to bilateral trade, but these should not, in my view, constitute barriers within the remit of the WTO rules. It is estimated that additional EU iron and steel exports could be worth EUR 107 million per year, which would benefit our companies working in the sector.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Russian Federation is an important trading partner for the European Union. Previous restrictions on imports of certain steel products from Russia were a result of the fact that the Russian Federation was not part of the World Trade Organisation. As you know, the principal task of the World Trade Organisation is liberalisation of international trade in goods and services, as well as supporting trade and resolving any disputes that arise in this area. States that are members of the WTO must adapt their internal laws to the standards set by the Organisation. Russia’s accession to the WTO in late December 2011 has meant that the European Union cannot apply quotas for the abovementioned goods. Trade liberalisation, particularly at this time of economic crisis, could certainly have a positive impact on relations between the EU and Russia and will also help, to some extent and over the long term, to improve the economic situation of both parties.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Since Russia became a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in December 2011, the European Union has lost the right to apply the Agreement on trade in certain steel products, concerning managing certain restrictions on imports of certain steel products originating in Russia. Keeping this regulation in place, thereby retaining the import quotas for steel products, would constitute a breach of WTO rules and would expose the EU to Russian legal action. The EU therefore has to repeal the agreement currently in force.

The fact that electronic versions of legal acts are not legally binding is unacceptable in itself, and creates uncertainty as to the precise content of the EU legal acts currently available in the EUR-LEX database.

The upshot of regarding the electronic edition of the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ) as the official, authentic, up-to-date and complete version will be greater legal certainty. At the same time, this action will help avoid the hefty costs involved in publishing the paper version of the OJ, which is a welcome saving for the EU budget. Given the current economic climate and the difficulties facing both a number of Member States and ordinary citizens, it is important for European institutions to eliminate unnecessary and avoidable costs, while identifying practical ways to make savings.

      <p sl="it">Independent research shows that the digital divide has largely been overcome in all age groups, adding value to education and increasing interaction. We live in a world with over 600 million websites, and much of the interaction with government and public departments is now conducted on the Internet. According to Eurostat, in 2009, at least 65% of European businesses used e -government tools, a percentage that rises to 83% for big companies. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has often indicated the development of e -government as a major requirement for perfecting transparency and simplification processes. Forcing time-consuming and complex consultation of paper documents on a society that now lives with, communicates and gets information digitally, as well as entrusting essential areas of its life – from the financial markets to telemedicine – to the Internet, appears out-of-date and in need of urgent updating, especially given the widespread negative repercussions, for example, on the economy and on business, due to legal uncertainty and the consequent curb on investments, trade and growth.

The Official Journal of the European Union (OJ) is already published electronically, and this is the primary reference format. However, the Court of Justice has specified that where there is no legal basis, electronic publication does not have legal value, and therefore the associated rights and obligations cannot be claimed or enforced. Giving the electronic version of the OJ legal value means a significant increase in transparency because it will be immediately accessible to everyone free of charge, and all the information it contains will be reliable and binding. I believe it is right to make official information accessible to as many people as possible, and therefore I voted in favour of the report on the electronic publication of the Official Journal of the European Union .

      <p sl="hu">With the adoption of the regulation on authenticity of the electronic version of the Official Journal of the European Union , we are taking another step towards bringing the work of the EU institutions and, in particular, the results of legislative work, closer to EU citizens. The legislative process, whose parliamentary phase we have concluded today, started in 2011 as one of the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. In today’s accelerated world, money, energy and time can be saved by official texts being accessible in reliable electronic form, and EU documentation is no exception. For the time being, the paper version of the Official Journal of the European Union is the publication format that is official and may be cited by all. That hinders the authorities’ and citizens’ procedures. The content of the electronic version is for information purposes only. The number of citizens interested in the results of legislation keeps on growing, which is why it is important that readers can rely fully on the texts published in the electronic version of the Official Journal. As the Official Journal of the EU has also been available in electronic form since 1998, the number of subscribers to the paper version has decreased considerably. Through the electronic Official Journal becoming authentic, legal security will increase, the work of the EU institutions will become more transparent, and the lives of citizens working with EU law will become simpler, while public administration efficiency will also improve. I voted in favour of the report as its shadow rapporteur from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats).</p>

Today, the majority of users of the European Union’s Official Journal submit their queries through its electronic environment (EUR-LEX), and it is strange that although we have an online database through which all European Union legislation is available, citation of the Internet version has no basis in law. This means that one must seek information about current legislation in the printed version of the Official Journal, which is a time-consuming, costly and outmoded option.

However, there has been a delay in electronic publication of the Official Journal of the European Union for reasons of legal basis. In order to overcome these obstacles and give the public direct access to European decisions, the European Parliament has proposed that we should apply the flexibility clause (Article 352 TFEU) as an appropriate response to the legal questions raised by the Member States. Of course, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, electronic publication of EU legal instruments, which, for the moment, are available in the EUR-Lex database, is more than welcome and we are convinced that this reform will increase legal certainty and reduce access costs for citizens and companies alike.

      <p sl="pt">This report essentially concerns the proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs that electronic publication should equate to valid publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJ), with the printed edition having legal value only in the exceptional and temporary cases of unforeseen disruption to the electronic publication. It is noteworthy that the background to this proposed change is a 2007 judgment by the European Court of Justice stating that legal rights cannot be claimed and obligations cannot be enforced on the basis of the electronic version of the OJ. This is, therefore, a positive reform of how the OJ is published, as it provides for increased legal certainty and better public access to European Union legal acts because practically all users consult only the electronic version of EU legal acts nowadays. Moreover, consulting paper versions of the OJ is a time-consuming, costly process, and is carried out by very few users.

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report, which also highlights the need for a public service obligation for any air services of economic and public interest that are not economically viable. In the context of the trans-European transport network, this is extremely important as regards equitable treatment for the outermost regions, which are repeatedly excluded and kept in isolation. However, this report advocates a balanced approach to revising aviation guidelines and warns of the ‘proliferation’ of new regional airports, which could result in an economic burden on regions that have chosen to have one without having sufficient traffic to feed it. Existing regional airports need to integrate better with Europe’s interlinked transport network. Finally, the more rigorous security measures implemented in regional airports should be paid for out of normal taxation. This report sends a strong message to the Commission to review certain issues linked to regional aviation in Europe, so as to make regional airports and the services they provide more attractive to passengers and services.</p>

      <p sl="it">I totally agree with some of the principles expressed in the report by Mr Bradbourn in helping regional airports, especially those located in remote areas or on islands, to develop and strengthen existing links in order to avoid them becoming the exclusive domain of low-cost airlines. It is right to carry out cost-benefit analyses beforehand in order to draw up a national plan for airports and, if necessary, to construct new ones. Good planning can only bring benefits and responses to social and local needs, hence, to the creation of new jobs and services, improving the quality of life of citizens as well as of businesses and, to an even greater extent, of tourism. Let us not forget that tourism is the European Union’s third largest socio-economic activity, representing 10% of GDP and 12% of jobs. In line, moreover, with the strategy on the future of tourism adopted on 27 September 2011, this report makes a considerable contribution to stimulating competition in the tourism industry and to consolidating Europe’s image and visibility as a tourist destination. Finally, I think it is appropriate that regional airports should also be included in the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) guidelines on the same level as ground transport systems, and that they, too, should be eligible for private and public funding.</p>

      <p sl="fr">European regional airports are too often underestimated. They must be supported and better integrated as a matter of urgency. As Mr Bradbourn highlighted, there is a tendency by the Commission to neglect the opportunities regional airports represent in terms of the integration and prosperity of the EU. You already know my commitment to the development of European regions. These airports can contribute to the revitalisation of local economies, which Europe desperately needs. Through this resolution, I am calling for better integration of small airports in the European central transport network, as they enable regions to become more dynamic and are a source of job creation. Using regional airports more would also take pressure off large airports, reducing their congestion.

      <p sl="lt">I welcome the proposal to stress the importance of regional airports and their contribution to the EU transport network, and thus promote the creation of a strong, competitive and economically viable EU aviation area. The movement of people and goods between regions and the smooth running of the EU’s single market are essential generators of the EU’s economic growth. Airports play an important role in increasing territorial, economic and social cohesion in the Member States by connecting regions. Suitable air transport links would enable the regions to cope with their inherent geographical handicaps and would help develop the local economy and tourism by attracting investors. I welcome the calls for the Commission to guarantee the correct application of European and national legislation on airlines’ social conditions and terms of employment and agree that the scope of any future studies must be extended to regional airports. Encouraging sector representatives to develop multimodal through-ticketing between the rail and air sector is one of the most important recommendations in my opinion.</p>

I therefore welcome this report, which recalls the key importance that regional aviation plays in the development of European regions. Ensuring a tight network across the EU; that is our ambition. Nevertheless, this report also recalls that we must take care not to encourage the proliferation of regional airports, as this tendency would ultimately run counter to the initial objectives, in economic terms (costs that are too high to bear), environmental terms, or even in terms of geographical logic (not enough traffic). Furthermore, this report is also an opportunity to point out certain abusive practices on the part of low-cost airlines. The restrictions these airlines apply to baggage, for example, should be better regulated, along with the charges added to the initial ticket price. Consumers should enjoy a high-quality service, regardless of the airlines they use. This report is a step in the right direction. It is now up to the Commission to make regional airports key elements in an efficient European transport network covering the whole of the EU.</p>

However, I strongly disagreed with paragraph 13 of this report in two respects. Commercial and retail activities can have perverse effects by cross-subsidising landing charges. This can leave the busiest airports being able to offer lower landing charges, thus making it more difficult for regional airports to compete. Moreover, restrictions on hand baggage granted by budget carriers are not a breach of competition law and conversely have stimulated competition.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Regional airports are becoming an important factor for economic growth, stimulating development in the cities and regions they serve. They also extend transport routes. Unfortunately, the Union’s policy in this area to date, which has focused mainly on key transport hubs, did not bring benefits to smaller centres. It is, however, in the interest of individual regions to increase the profitability of these centres. The proposals put forward in the resolution to make the European Aviation Area more effective will encourage regional development. For example, regional airports may turn out to be very effective at reducing traffic and congestion at large hubs. Another excellent idea, with clear benefits to passengers, is the proposal to develop multimodal travel by selling joint tickets for air and train travel. In addition, by eliminating some of the burdensome practices of cheap carriers, we can also improve passenger comfort. Regional air travel may turn out to be key for the free movement of citizens and to improve the flow of goods and services. I support the resolution.</p>

I think that they are able to attract new business, while offering numerous opportunities for regional tourism, as well as for specialised cargo transport. Integrating regional airports into the TEN-T will create opportunities for private funding for airport infrastructures and will encourage Member States to invest in integrated ground connections with large airports. With a view to improving the overall quality of services, certain practices adopted by low-cost airlines, such as certain unavoidable charges applied to the basic price of their airline tickets, or the enforcement of extremely harsh rules regarding the number and size of hand luggage items, must be regulated.</p>

It is appropriate that we should discuss these in depth and intervene with the tools at our disposal, calling on the relevant local bodies to look at the issue themselves. I would like to draw attention to four main issues. The first is territorial cohesion, which involves delicate issues of citizenship rights and problems in the capacity of the local economies in the surrounding areas. Then there are the practices of low-cost airlines, which are only partly linked to the low margins of this sector, and should involve consideration of consumer rights, especially in view of the intervention by the Spanish Government. Then there is the role of regional airports in the local economies, and structural weaknesses that expose them to the pressure of dominant powers. Finally, and above all, there is the need to bring regional airports within the sphere of attention and action of the European legislator, through simplification and alignment of the laws, and incentives to build integrated systems and networks that successfully exploit multimodality.

It will therefore contribute significantly to these regions’ territorial cohesion, and to their social and economic development. It is important, particularly at a time of economic crisis, to prevent the proliferation of regional airports, which would meet neither efficiency nor sustainability targets. However, it is also crucial to maintain and strengthen existing ties with regions affected by less favourable geographical conditions, as well as to promote better links between regional airports and neighbouring cities, which could bring clear benefits in alleviating the excessive burden on central airports. It is crucial to adopt the measures needed to facilitate improvements to regional airports’ operational and economic effectiveness, as well as to improve the conditions offered to passengers using such infrastructure and services.

      <p sl="it">The free movement of persons within the boundaries of the European Union is one of the four fundamental freedoms guaranteed to European citizens. A comprehensive transport network that is not restricted to the major capitals needs to be set up in order for this right to be effectively guaranteed. Parliament therefore has the responsibility of adjusting the direction taken by the Commission, which is too focused on developing hubs, and shows little interest in the potential of regional airports. The full development of the latter is, in fact, fundamental for guaranteeing the aforementioned freedom of movement, and for promoting economic development in the areas where these airports are built, because their expansion would also alleviate the problems of congestion at hubs, and consequently make the transport system more sustainable from an environmental point of view as well. For the above reasons, I therefore voted in favour of this report on the future of regional airports.

However, there are regions, especially the outermost regions, or peripheral or island regions, where airports are the only effective means of linking them to the rest of Europe. EU policy in this regard should be to promote the supply of rigorous public services that prioritise security. It should not permit the proliferation of regional airports but should create an interlinked system that makes the market more competitive and promotes regional development, by accelerating the implementation of the European air traffic management system (SESAR), the Clean Sky initiative and the enforcement of Single European Sky legislation.

The fact that it argues for the Single European Sky and, hence, for the sector to be market-facing, is also very enlightening. There are various apologies for free competition – which is above criticism – and for the resulting limitations on state intervention throughout the text. Moreover, even security issues are subjugated to the free competition principle: according to item 37, measures in this regard are limited by this principle.

It is important that we create an aviation area that is strong, competitive and economically viable. European regional airports and air services need to be considered as key elements in creating an efficient and well-functioning EU transport network that facilitates trade and ensures mobility for a greater number of people. Regional aviation can play a vital role in ensuring that free movement in the EU is a reality not only for people living in major capital cities, but also for EU citizens living outside these areas, ensuring that these cities and regions enjoy not only the benefits brought about by greater mobility, but also by generating tourism.

The difficulties are caused by their monopolisation by low-cost airlines and the unfair practices employed by the latter, as well as isolation from the remainder of the transport network and infrastructures which force passengers to change means of transport several times before reaching the regional airport. All of this cancels out the original advantage sought by the traveller, inevitably leading many potential passengers to prefer travelling with major airlines via the larger and more functional hubs.

      <p sl="hu">The competitiveness of the regions in the European Union is in line with regional economic growth. Those regions that have all the capabilities that an airport can provide are more competitive and better able to attract capital. Today, a regional airport is a prerequisite for an investment location. It is vital for modern logistics and is also one of the most effective regional development factors. Serious investors are unlikely to be interested in regions where there is no airport or where the airport does not operate appropriately. The expansion of low-cost carriers was another factor that highlighted the role of smaller airports. Since such carriers focus on keeping their costs low, they prefer using smaller airports provided with appropriate infrastructure, rather than large, crowded airports. They can then use transfer services to transport their passengers to the larger cities in the vicinity. This method has worked in Western Europe and, in my home country, for instance, there is already an example of such cooperation in the town of Debrecen. In conclusion, I believe that European regional airports and flights need to be seen as key factors in creating an effective, smoothly operating EU transport network that will promote trade and provide mobility for a wider public.

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this report which rightly stresses the importance of air transport, particularly to outlying areas. A number of the Members of this House are opposed to the report on the basis that greater priority should be given to other forms of transport, such as rail. Whilst this may be a valid argument in some parts of the EU, it ignores the geographical and demographic realities of other parts, such as the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed the resolution on the future of regional airports and air services in the EU because regional airports and air services are not only essential as transport nodes, helping to facilitate the smooth running of the EU’s single market by moving people and goods between regions, but they are also essential as generators of economic growth in their own right. Together, they expand the horizon of traditional trading routes and provide a significant boost to the cities and regions that they serve. These infrastructures and services are important for people living outside major urban areas and to the EU as a whole. When proposing legislation in the field of aviation, there is a tendency by the European Commission to focus attention on major hub airports. This report seeks to redress this balance and bring attention to the manner in which regional airports and air services have often been unintentionally, yet disproportionately, affected by some EU legislation. We also need to look for ways of improving the operational and economic efficiency of regional airports and air services as well as the experience of passengers using these facilities and services.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I supported the report on airports, but would like to remind everyone that legislative coordination would be required in this case. We have fundamentally impaired operating conditions for regional airports with rules governing air traffic emissions trading, which favour large aircraft and key routes. Furthermore, the emissions trading scheme in question was part of a unilateral climate policy that does not just harm our competitiveness but the environment also, while putting European airlines that have managed their business well at a competitive disadvantage. Now that the weaknesses in the unilateral climate policy have been recognised, it is now unlikely that such legislation will get through this House. Unfortunately, the EU would appear to lack the political humility to withdraw this failed legislation.</p>

      <p sl="it">With this report, we wish to underline the important role played by regional airports and related air services, as they not only contribute to ensuring that the EU’s single market works effectively by transporting people and goods between the regions, but are also capable of producing economic growth themselves, attracting greater economic investment. Often however, they have been unintentionally, yet disproportionately, affected or excluded by some EU legislation.</p>

We therefore call for greater commitment to developing the new-generation European traffic management system (SESAR) and the Single European Sky, as their completion could lead to huge economic and environmental savings brought about by greater efficiency, as well as allowing some smaller regional airports to benefit from new investments and technology.</p>

To place a disproportionate burden on regional airports and air services through EU legislation is to underestimate the importance of their role as key transport interchanges that make a considerable contribution to smooth transportation within the EU’s internal market and to the advent of a more efficient air space for the EU.

      <p sl="en">I wholeheartedly welcome my colleague Mr Bradbourn’s report on regional airports. This has received widespread support in Parliament, which is a testament to the importance of the issue. In regions such as my constituency of Northern Ireland, which could be deemed as being somewhat peripheral, the services provided by regional airports are of vital importance to individuals, businesses and the local economy in general. For me, the crucial point of this report is the call for regional airports to be given some protection and security in relation to their access to larger ‘hub’ airports. This crucial aspect of ‘connectivity’ can be put at risk if airlines decide to reallocate slots to more profitable routes. As another airline has recently decided to pull out of Belfast City Airport – resulting in a further reduction of air services for Northern Ireland – the issues raised in this report are very timely.</p>

At the same time, I think that the provision in Recital A, which excludes the measures being proposed from being applied to regional airports that mainly serve a capital city, is questionable, to say the least.

      <p sl="de">Europe’s regional airports and the corresponding air services are key to the creation of an efficient and optimally functioning EU transport network. People are travelling more often, and their mobility must be safeguarded. Regional aviation can play a crucial role and it must be ensured that mobility in the EU is not reserved for people in the metropolises, but is also for everyone outside these European capitals in remote, outlying areas and rural communities. These often neglected regions, too, need to be allowed to enjoy the benefits of greater mobility. These benefits result from tourism and better access to new markets and, in turn, from the increased inward flow of economic investment. I take the view that if we were to better integrate our regional airports into the transport network as a whole, we could stimulate the economy to produce further benefits for European citizens.

However, the crisis has badly hurt regional airports, which are now uncompetitive, leading to stronger ties between major airports and airlines, resulting in less choice and higher prices for customers. The inclusion of regional airports in the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) guidelines could facilitate access to private funding and encourage Member States to invest in better ground transport networks – especially high-speed trains. In any case, in order to improve the general quality of the services, we need to tackle a number of practices adopted by the major low-cost operators, such as excessive booking charges and hand luggage restrictions that discourage travellers from buying products at the airport.</p>

They are an important source of social and economic development in the regions – especially in regions where other forms of transport are lacking, they attract new companies and can boost regional tourism. The report also deals with an important point on consumer protection: the issue of certain practices by the main low-cost airlines, namely, abusive reservation charges or hand luggage restrictions, which discourage travellers from buying goods in the airport.

      <p sl="sv">The European Parliament recently voted in favour of an own-initiative report on the future of regional airports and air services in the EU (2011/2196(INI)). I, personally, chose to vote against the report. The report highlighted the many positive aspects of regional airports. However, instead of helping these regional airports, which are often used by low-cost airlines, measures were proposed that will severely limit the competitiveness of these airlines. Through a host of rules regulating hand luggage, charges for voluntary payment by credit card, the option to employ staff through employment agencies, the rug is being pulled from under the feet of many low-cost airlines (paragraphs 42 to 45 of the report).</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the future of regional airports and air services in the EU because regional airports contribute to economic development, revitalising industry and generating employment in their regions. Regional airports with high-volume connectivity with third countries and intra-European traffic, and which contribute to multimodal transport in their region, as well as regional airports which can be used to relieve bottlenecks, should be included in the TEN-T planning. We are concerned about the ‘one bag’ rule and other hand luggage restrictions imposed by some airline companies. Such practices end up diminishing the quality of services to passengers, breach competition law, as well as the duty of transparency with regard to the charges applicable to tickets. We call on the Commission to take a balanced approach when revising aviation guidelines in order to provide for a socially and economically viable development of regional air services. Consideration should be given to the development of the infrastructure needed to ensure intermodality, while also making these services accessible to EU citizens and taking into account the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>

      <p sl="en">I very much welcome today’s vote on the future of regional airports. As a Catalan with an important ‘regional’ airport like Barcelona and other minor ones such as Lleida, Girona and Reus, I believe that the role of such airports should be recognised fully. However in these times of severe economic crisis, I would like to underscore the importance of cost-benefit analyses when constructing new regional airports in Spain, as public investments should display a certain relationship between the amounts of money spent and the number of passengers using these airports. I strongly believe that regional airports should not be tools to enhance public deficits and should be economically sustainable in the mid-term.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report recognises the importance of regional airports and air services for economic development in the regions, in a number of territories, and in the outermost regions.

Throughout the report, there are arguments for the Single European Sky and for the sector to be market-facing; we are profoundly opposed to both approaches.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Discharge is the final approval of the EU budget for a given year. Following the audit and the finalisation of the annual accounts, it falls on the Council of the European Union to draw up a recommendation and then it is up to us, the MEPs, to decide whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget for the preceding financial year. This decision is based, in part, on a review of the annual accounts and on the Court of Auditors’ annual report. Discharge is therefore the political dimension of the external audit of the implementation of the budget. In Parliament, we voted this week on whether or not to grant discharge to the European institutions and agencies for 2010. We approved the Commission budget for 2010. However, we are calling on the Commission to reduce the error rate, which reached 7.7% in the areas of cohesion, energy and transport.</p>

The Commission is responsible for executing the EU budget and managing programmes and it is therefore vitally important in this difficult economic and financial crisis for the Commission to be an example by ensuring good public management. Good public management is an essential factor for maintaining citizens’ confidence in the European Union. The continuing financial and budgetary crisis in Member States also poses a risk to the Union budget, particularly due to financial risks in relation to loans granted to Member States. I welcome the European Parliament’s calls for the Commission to present an Action Plan for the achievement of priority actions such as closely monitoring the use of financial engineering instruments, improving and strengthening accountability, reconsidering the increased use of pre-financing and creating an effective sanctioning mechanism in the area of cohesion policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">The Fjellner report cannot count on my support. The European Court of Auditors has noted that, for 2010, the number of errors in the policy area which has had the highest error rate for years, namely the Structural Funds, and which we know as cohesion policy, has increased. The European Parliament’s report rightly addresses requests to the European Commission. For example, I am pleased that my amendment which calls for the Emergency Fund to be monitored in respect of the legality, regularity and efficiency of spending, has been adopted. On the other hand, an opportunity that has been missed is that the discharge has not been made conditional on progress in national statements of assurance. These ensure that Member States are more aware of their responsibility to spend the EU funds they manage prudently. That would help reduce the error rate, because a substantial number of the errors could have been prevented or corrected if Member States had been sufficiently alert. It is ironic that ministers of countries with problems have turned down the European Parliament’s invitation to discuss improvements. To put it briefly, the European Commission will only be able to enforce the sensible demands made in the report if discharge is postponed. I regret that the Committee on Budgetary Control did not want to take that step.</p>

There is a regulation that aims to improve public access to the documents of the European institutions. This is a battle, which we are waging in Parliament, for greater transparency and closer cooperation between the institutions. It is therefore good news that the Commission has heard our requests.

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Commission, as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The discharge report draws attention to the fact that in the field of cohesion policy, the estimated error rate in 2010 increased to 7.7%, which is higher than the 2009 value. The discharge report highlights, among other points, the need to place more emphasis in future on more effective control of financial planning tools. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010, and I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="sv">For the first time since 2006, the annual report from the European Court of Auditors showed an increase in the proportion of errors made in the implementation of the EU budget – from 3.3% (in 2009) to 3.7%. This increase is extremely worrying and must not be allowed to recur.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is the Commission that is ultimately responsible for the use of EU funds. Nevertheless, the Court of Auditors’ criticism is not directed at the Commission first and foremost, but at the Member States. For around 80% of the EU’s expenditure, management of the funds is shared between the Commission and the Member States, and it is the Member States that are responsible for the payments. It is also within these expenditure areas that the error percentage increased most during 2010.

This will enable the Commission to accept fully its final and overall responsibility for implementing the budget. Finally, in the context of the economic and financial crisis that the EU is experiencing, it is important that EU budgetary policy gives due consideration to the specific situation in the Member States, particularly when this affects not only EU own resources but also cofinancing and the need for financial assistance provided under the Treaties, the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and the European Stability Mechanism.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report and the annexed resolution includes many points with which we do not agree. The rapporteur raises suspicions about and makes accusations against the Member States, plays down their role in budget execution, disrespects certain fundamental principles of their sovereignty and advocates close ‘policing’ of them by the Commission. The rapporteur highlights that there has been an increased error rate relating to management of EU funds – the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund, energy and transportation – and that this has been caused by the Member States mismanaging such funding. It therefore suggests that the Commission sanctions non-conforming Member States ‘with different tools’. These tools range from interrupting or suspending fund payments to the external authorities that the report advocates. It also stresses that these payments may only be restarted ‘if sufficient appropriate audit evidence gathered on the spot proves that weaknesses were remedied’. At the same time, it does not elaborate – as it could and should have done – on some of the causes motivating a variety of types of non-conformity.</p>

More than 90% of all errors were identified outside the Commission at Member State authority and final beneficiary level. I welcomed discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Commission budget, which accounts for more than 80% of all EU expenditure.

I welcome the conclusions and recommendations presented by the Court of Auditors in these reports and the calls for the Commission and the Member States to fully take these recommendations into account. As the member of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats responsible for dealing with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) issue in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would like to draw particular attention to Special Report No 2/2011 of the Court of Auditors entitled ‘Follow-up of Special Report No 1/2005 concerning the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office’. Of particular concern are the observations by the Court of Auditors that average case duration at OLAF is over two years, which indicates that problems remain with OLAF’s management system and the allocation of tasks. A cooperation agreement was signed in 2008 between OLAF and Eurojust, which seeks to combat fraud more effectively, but given the number of cases passed by OLAF to Eurojust (OLAF sent information about five cases in 2008 and only one case in 2009), it is clear that the cooperation between these two offices is not working. I agree that it is essential to improve OLAF’s management structure and reduce the time taken to investigate cases, which would enable us to combat financial crime and fraud more effectively throughout the EU.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the 2010 special reports of the European Court of Auditors on the European Commission, as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The European Court of Auditors calls on the European Commission to act more effectively with regard to the Member States and to regroup more officials to control state subsidies without delay. It urges the Commission to consider whether it can use the lessons learned from successful management of the financial crisis to simplify work carried out under ‘normal’ circumstances. I support the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors that measures taken within the framework of the supervisory and coordination powers of the Commission need to be reinforced. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

The European Court of Auditors has to submit an annual report on the financial year to the European Parliament. The special reports by the Court of Auditors provide Parliament with information on how funds are spent, thereby qualifying it for its role as discharge authority. Following analysis of this report, I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission needs to make changes to procedure, in line with the proposals set out in the reports, whilst informing the European Parliament so as to guarantee legal certainty to all those involved in the reports.

      <p sl="pt">All European institutions that depend on the EU budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function. There is a need to verify that EU funds are being put to good use, that the institutions are meeting their established objectives, and that no resources are being wasted. The Court of Auditors has drafted a number of special reports for the Commission, according to which we can generally say that the institutions in question – with only a few exceptions, to judge by the audits that we have already seen – are using the funds available to them properly and meeting the proposed objectives.

      <p sl="et">I supported this report, as I agree with the special reports of the Court of Auditors regarding the implementation of the budget for the year 2010. I share the view expressed in the Court of Auditors’ recommendation in Special Report No 7/2010 that it is important to implement a reform of the accounts clearance procedure and the discharge procedure, which would help reduce the duration of procedures and establish a clear relationship between sums recovered and the actual illegal payments. As regards Special Report No 14/2010 on the safety of imported meat, I am completely in agreement with the Court of Auditors’ recommendation calling on the Commission to endeavour to eliminate the different treatment of Member States in third countries, which amounts to discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="et">For instance, the Russian Federation has introduced an import ban on pigs and other animals from European Union Member States, which essentially only affects Estonia and Latvia, because exports of live animals from these countries form the majority of exports of live animals to Russia from the EU. The misinterpretation of food hygiene requirements is a sordid method for achieving other political objectives and should be condemned at the highest levels of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="et">In Special Report No 07/2011, I think it is important to establish more clearly targeted rural development programmes in Member States, because the objective should be to actually implement them and not to prepare them simply because they are required by European Union bureaucracy.</p>

I would highlight the fact that the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) make more use of its investigative powers, for example, by carrying out on-the-spot checks and interviews, or by focusing on more serious and complex cases. For this reason in particular, but on the basis of the recommendations tabled by the European Parliament and taking into account the Council recommendation and the aforementioned reports by the European Court of Auditors, I voted to approve the accounts submitted by the European Commission and to discharge the 2010 accounts.</p>

Considerable details have been added on finance for Parliament’s prizes over three years. It is important to block the scheme of closing EuroparlTV and return to the rapporteur’s original call for a cost-benefit analysis in the first instance. Finally, it is important to welcome the initiative of examining possible cost reductions in Parliament, as requested in the resolution on the 2013 budget.

      <p sl="it">The report attached to the discharge of the European Parliament’s budget highlights the failure of the EuroparlTV project and, in view of the low number of direct users, calls on the Secretary-General to present proposals to the competent committee for the closure of the operation. The report also quantifies the enormous waste related to maintaining Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg, which cost in excess of EUR 50 million in 2010, while it is estimated that establishing a single seat would deliver savings of approximately EUR 180 million. In addition, the report underlines the fact that Parliament has already expressed its view on this, declaring itself in favour of closing the Strasbourg seat. Wasting public money is never acceptable, but it is even more heinous in times of recession like the present, as Member States are being forced to ask sacrifices of their taxpayers.

Particularly important are the references to potential savings from better rationalisation of missions between the three sites in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg; the delays with and considerable increase in the cost of Parliament’s new visitor centre; the cost and lack of clarity associated with the House of European History; and the costs relating to the travel agency. It is noteworthy that the rapporteur proposes abolishing prizes such as the LUX Prize for cinema and also mentions scrapping the Prize for Journalism, but says nothing about the future of the Sakharov Prize, which is the most expensive and has been increased by EUR 352 348 since 2009.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The audit by the Court of Auditors concluded, as regards 2010 administrative expenditure, that all the institutions had satisfactorily implemented the oversight and control measures required by the Financial Regulation and that 93% of the 58 audited payments did not contain material errors. Moreover, on 16 June 2011, the Secretary-General of the European Parliament certified that he is sufficiently sure that Parliament’s budget was implemented in line with the principles of sound financial management. Furthermore, the system of checks provides the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. I therefore voted to approve the accounts submitted by the European Commission and to discharge the 2010 accounts. In fact, by granting discharge to a particular institution or agency, Parliament is declaring that the spending thereof was in line with EU rules and closing the budget. If the application breached the existing rules, Parliament could either refuse or postpone discharge. That has not happened in this case, in which discharge has been granted to the EU accounts for the financial year 2010, Section I – European Parliament.</p>

I cannot vote positively on this issue without being able to vote on the consequences of such a decision. That would be tantamount to buying a pig in a poke. What about the distribution of institutions following the transfer from Strasbourg to Brussels, or the domino effect, which could turn out to be financially painful if bad decisions were made? Neither would I wish it to be a disaster for Belgium, or for anyone for that matter. We need to reflect in advance on the impact on direct or indirect jobs, and not after the fact, when it is too late. Here we are, facing the same scenario.

Staffing constraints are a concern. I welcome the fact that the Financial Management Toolkit was disseminated in order to improve knowledge of financial management and eligibility of rules by implementing organisations. As for Special Report No 11/2010 of the Court of Auditors, I agree with the audit and the constructive recommendations contained therein.

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. It is necessary for the European Commission to obtain further information regarding the implementation of the EDFs at national and regional level and to ensure better visibility for all Union-funded activities overseas. It gives reason for concern, however, that, in 2010, the oversight and control systems were once again only partially effective when providing payments from the EDFs; still, the discharge report concluded that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

It is noteworthy that the Court of Auditors takes the view that there is still a high frequency of encoding errors which, while not having a material impact on the annual accounts in 2010, could potentially affect the reliability of EuropeAid financial management data.

      <p sl="pt">The report criticises the fact that the European Development Fund (EDF), as the EU’s main financial instrument for development cooperation, is not included in the EU budget. The rapporteur calls on the Commission to propose including the EDF in the EU budget during discussions on the upcoming multiannual financial framework; that is not happening with the present Commission proposal, for now. There have been demands for this change for some time. It would provide EU development cooperation and development aid policy with funding that would be more robust and predictable, as well as making it easier for the institutions responsible for approving the budget to scrutinise. However, we do not share the view that the European External Action Service should ‘fully exercise its political role by active participation in developing the political goals of the recipient countries’. We are also unable to accept the paragraphs mentioning that ‘sound and well-functioning trade relations in line with [World Trade Organisation] principles is [sic] key’ to developing countries’ social and economic development, and those calling on the Commission to resolve outstanding conflicts concerning the proposed economic partnership agreements and free trade between Europe and African, Caribbean and Pacific states.</p>

It should be noted that the Court of Auditors found that although these errors did not have a material impact on the annual accounts in 2010, they can potentially affect the reliability of EuropeAid financial management data. According to the Court of Auditors, the revenue and commitments are free from material error, but there is great concern about the significant frequency of non-quantifiable errors affecting commitments in terms of compliance with tendering rules and legal deadlines for the signature of contracts.

The report by the Court of Auditors criticised the Council for diverting interpretation/translation funding into the Residence Palace project and the Council’s response was that it had abandoned this practice. The European Parliament wants the various institutions to be individually specified in the negotiations on the Financial Regulation, so as to avoid such ambiguity in future and to give Parliament a strong mandate for separate discharge for each body. Inevitably, the Council is not prepared to accept this clarification. The European Parliament scrutinises its own budgetary implementation and wants to reach a position whereby there is an equivalent process for all the institutions, so as to prevent Council spending. Parliament’s services have provided the information demanded by the competent committee, thereby enabling it to reach an informed decision on budgetary discharge.

      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur proposes that Parliament postpone granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the Council budget, in keeping with its power to make use of the two deadlines in the discharge timetable; the purpose, in this case, is to explore the possibility of reaching an agreement with the Presidency-in-Office. The grounds for this postponement are the Council’s lack of transparency and failure to account for its spending, which have led to the dispute that has been dragging on between the two institutions – Parliament and the Council – for a long time. The entire report criticises the Council’s position, as it is refusing to submit documents relating to implementation of its budget, to meet, or to answer Parliament’s questions on that matter. As a result, Parliament has no knowledge of the Council’s accounts, even though it takes part in the discharge procedure. The rapporteur also puts forward a number of questions for the Council to answer on administrative issues (including some on the European External Action Service) and on the Common Foreign and Security Policy/Common Security and Defence Policy tasks, amongst other matters. We voted for this report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because in its annual report for 2010, the Court of Auditors concluded, based on its audit work, that the payments as a whole for the year ended 31 December 2010 for the administrative and other expenses of the institutions and bodies were free from material error. I welcome the provision that an in-depth assessment of oversight and control systems in the Council must be carried out, similar to the assessments carried out in relation to the Court of Justice, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor in the course of preparation of the Court of Auditors’ annual report concerning the financial year 2010. European taxpayers have every right to expect that the entirety of the Union budget, including all the funds managed autonomously by its separate institutions and agencies, should be subject to full public scrutiny. It is wrong that, unlike the other Union institutions, the Council does not consider itself responsible for the use of the funds made available to it.</p>

I voted in favour of discharge for the 2010 budget of the Court of Justice. Discharge is the final approval of the EU budget for a given year. Following the audit and the finalisation of the annual accounts, it falls on the Council of the European Union to make a recommendation and then it is up to us, the MEPs, to decide whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the EU budget for the preceding financial year.

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Court of Justice as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. In its annual report for 2010, the Court of Auditors did not raise any objections in connection with the 2010 financial management of the Court of Justice. Based on its audit work, the Court of Auditors concluded that the payments as a whole for the year ended 31 December 2010 for administrative and other expenditure of the institutions and bodies were free from material error; the most likely error rate for administrative expenditure as a whole was assessed as 0.4%. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Ayala Sender, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2010, Section IV – Court of Justice. The Court of Justice has the task of ensuring that the legislation adopted by the European Parliament is applied in the same way across all the Member States. Moreover, it resolves not only disputes between national governments and the European institutions, but also conflicts involving companies, private individuals and organisations that feel unfairly treated by a European institution. The Court of Justice’s budgetary implementation was faultless. Therefore, and having regard to the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am voting for this report with a view to granting the Registrar of the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur proposes granting the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2010, which means recognising that this body complied with the European rules in its budgetary implementation and considers its budget closed. The Court of Auditors has drafted its report and found that there are no significant errors. There is, however, one aspect that deserves to be highlighted and which is included in the resolution adopted: it is obvious that the number of new cases brought before the Court of Justice has increased considerably. There were 631 in 2010. The way the EU rides roughshod over national sovereignties finds expression in many fields, including the legal field. The new – or old in the ideology that inspires it – Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union is symptomatic of the attack on the sovereignty of national institutions, including in legal terms, given the unprecedented powers it assigns to the Court of Justice. That may exacerbate the trend mentioned by the rapporteur even further. It is an unacceptable path that we reject and will fight.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour because this grants the Registrar of the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2010.

The in-depth information on staff management already provided by the Court of Justice in its annual activity report and the response the Court gave to the additional questions Parliament asked on this matter should be welcomed.

In this respect, however, it would be preferable, in future, to avert misunderstandings of the kind that has occurred in connection with the current discharge report on the agencies, which arose from the discrepancy between what was predicted by the relevant Court of Auditors’ official at the start of the financial year and what was presented before Parliament as the final result. I would encourage the Court of Auditors to perform an in-depth assessment of oversight and control systems in the Council before the end of 2012, as mentioned in Parliament’s resolution on discharge for 2009 (paragraph 8).</p>

The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. In its annual report, the Court of Auditors concluded, based on its audit work, that the payments of the Economic and Social Committee as a whole for the year ended 31 December 2010 for the administrative and other expenses of the institutions and bodies were free from material error; the most likely rate of error in the ‘administrative expenses’ section in general was 0.4%.

The Court of Auditors has drafted its report and found that there are no significant errors. Moreover, the EESC Bureau has decided to undertake a reform of the system for reimbursing expenses to members, including reimbursement of transport tickets on the basis of real costs only, since it was surprised at the large number of long-distance flights they had taken.

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Ombudsman as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. In its 2010 annual report, the Court of Auditors concluded that it will not raise any objections in connection with the European Ombudsman’s financial year 2010. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Inés Ayala Sender, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section VIII – European Ombudsman. The purpose of the European Ombudsman, whose office is totally independent of any government or entity, is to investigate complaints about European institutions, bodies, services and agencies when they disrespect the law or their guiding principles. In its 2010 annual report, the Court of Auditors found nothing meriting comment regarding the European Ombudsman. I therefore believe there are no problems with the implementation of the Ombudsman’s budget; the internal audit of 2010 following the 2009 observations must have contributed greatly to this. Therefore, and in view of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am voting for this report, as it grants discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Ombudsman for 2010.</p>

I should mention how important it is for the number and proportion of inquiries that are completed within less than a year to continue to increase, as well as the rise in the number and proportion of cases in which admissibility decisions are taken within one month.

It is important not to forget the opinion of the Court of Auditors as regards organising an internal competition, or the EDPS’s response. Competitions by the European Personnel Selection Office should remain standard for staff recruitment and the EDPS is called on to improve its human-resources planning, so as to prevent similar situations in future.

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) is an independent body entrusted with oversight powers, whose overriding objective is to ensure respect for the right to privacy and data protection by EU institutions and bodies, whenever they process personal data and develop new policy. In practice, the EDPS’s powers can be divided into three main areas: oversight, consultation and cooperation. It is therefore essential that it have sufficient resources to perform its duties in the best way possible. I voted for this report because the Court of Auditors concluded that the majority of payments for administrative and other expenditure by the EDPS in the year ended 31 December 2010 were free from material error, and that the oversight and control systems for administrative and other expenditure were effective in ensuring payment regularity.</p>

In its 2010 report, the Court of Auditors concluded that payments for the financial year ended 31 December 2010 were error-free. Moreover, the recommendations by the Court of Auditors and the Commission in 2009 had been implemented. A number of improvements were identified following on from these recommendations, specifically as regards staff recruitment. Therefore, and in view of the opinions by the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am voting for this report granting the EDPS discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

I welcome the European Parliament’s call for the Commission to implement as soon as possible the Court of Auditors’ recommendation for a zero-based budgeting approach for agencies when drawing up agencies’ budgets, meaning that in future, the budget of each agency would be drawn up without reference to historical amounts, but would be determined by the stand-alone needs of each agency.</p>

We support the agencies, as they can help us to make our food safer, our environment cleaner and our aeroplanes and flights safer. The rapporteur’s criticism also largely relates to situations that have already been dealt with, as well as circumstances that the agencies do not have any control over themselves. It is important to safeguard the agencies’ independence, but when an agency cannot do more than it is already doing in individual cases, it would be wrong to use these as a reason not to grant discharge.

With a view to supporting the Member States and their citizens, the European Union has created specialised and decentralised agencies to respond to the territorial dimension of Europe and to deal with its new technical, scientific and legal competences. The number of EU agencies has increased exponentially, from three in 2000 to 24 in 2011; their costs almost doubled between 2007 and 2010. I welcome the creation of the interinstitutional working group on agencies and the work it has done towards its objective of reviewing agencies’ roles, positions, structures, workings, oversight and management. I agree with the rapporteur that, in the times of crisis we are experiencing, we need to be sure that the cost of the agencies, which is around EUR 1.7 billion per year, is absolutely necessary and justified by improvements to the European public’s quality of life.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report weaves together criticisms of how the funds of some EU agencies are managed, tackling everything from conflicts of interest in some of these agencies to substantial increases in their budgets. One of the key priorities is the European Parliament’s request that the Court of Auditors submit a special report on comparative analyses of EU agencies’ costs, which has not yet been answered. So as to manage budgetary resources better, the Commission is called on to stop increasing the agencies’ budgets and even to consider reducing the contribution from the EU budget. While we agree with the majority of the rapporteur’s comments and criticisms, we do not accept that the demanded budget reduction should be made indiscriminately and regardless of the duties of the agency in question. Specifically, we do not support the stance that the reduction should be made ‘in particular’ in agencies whose main activity is research: the purpose of this proposal is bound up with the intention of making these institutions – which should not pursue ends other than those indisputably in the public interest – even more dependent on private interests.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the budget of the European Union agencies for the financial year 2010 because I am convinced that the management of these agencies had, all in all, been economical, and even though there had been considerable carryovers in the case of the majority of the agencies, they still used their available resources well and their activities in 2010 served the promotion of common policies. The report adopted by the Committee made a clear distinction between expenses on financial performance, human resources and internal and external control; these are essential to ensuring that the operation of organisations facilitating the professional work of the EU is transparent to all European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the resolution on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Union agencies for the financial year 2010: performance, financial management and control of European Union agencies. The decisions on the establishment and allocation of agencies taken by the Council during recent years are responsible for high expenditures and ineffectiveness of the functioning of the agencies concerned, as they are not based on efficiency considerations, leading, inter alia , to remote and high cost locations. Particularly at this time of crisis, the real added-value of the agencies should be seriously and rapidly analysed in order to avoid any non-mandatory and absolutely unnecessary spending, and to properly respond to the real needs of the Union and its citizens, and to react to concerns and the lack of confidence in our institutions. The Union and its Member States cannot ask Union citizens to save money without doing it themselves. Union bodies, agencies included, must be conscientious in making savings while requiring citizens, who are taxpayers contributing to the Union budget, to make savings as well.</p>

In my view, agencies need to reduce their running costs and follow a zero-based budgeting approach when drawing up their budgets: each agency budget must be based on its real current needs and not on its needs established years ago. It is also time for the Commission to carry out an evaluation in order to detect occurrences of unnecessary or overlapping activities and to analyse the merger of some of the agencies. EU agencies should publish on their websites the lists of all contracts awarded over the last three years as well as the list of the management board members together with their declaration of interests and curriculum vitae. The same should be done for all persons in management positions in the agencies and for all experts and scientific guests. Conflicts of interest have proved to be a serious concern in several agencies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Police cooperation is key to providing the European public with a high level of security throughout the area of freedom, security and justice. The European Police College (CEPOL) was created in 2001 to support the development of a European approach to the main problems relating to combating cross-border crime, to crime prevention, and to upholding public security. It provides police services with continuous training and development, and creates common quality standards for their methods and action criteria, so as to ensure a minimum level of training for the services responsible for applying the law throughout the EU. Both CEPOL and the European Police Office have become EU agencies, both of which have similar areas of involvement and complementary activities, so analysing the pros and cons of a possible merger could be relevant. This discussion should take place within the competent committee – the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – and on the basis of an impact assessment, in order that the decision reached can be backed up and will serve the public interest in the best possible way. No progress can ever be made with this type of decision in default of appearance within the context of a discharge process.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Police College as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The European Parliament approved the closure of the accounts of the European Police College for the financial year 2010. Although the Court of Auditors considered the transactions underlying the College’s annual accounts to be legal and regular, it also highlighted that, in respect of expenditure for organising courses and seminars, there was a lack of rigour in the process for approving cost claims related to such activities. The incompleteness of supporting evidence in particular raised questions in certain cases. It is important for the College to supply any missing documents as soon as possible and to avoid a repeat of similar deficiencies in the future. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

CEPOL brings together senior police officers from across Europe, with the aim of encouraging cross-border cooperation on combating crime and upholding public safety, law and order. CEPOL’s performance has been subjected to a number of criticisms regarding discharge of previous years’ accounts, with the 2009 accounts even being rejected for a period. I agree that CEPOL’s expenditure is high compared to its activities, so its restructuring needs to continue. Therefore, and in view of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control and the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I am voting for this report granting the Director of CEPOL discharge in respect of the implementation of the College’s budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

As such, the EASA needs to take measures relating to documenting its risk assessments after its annual inspection programmes and inspection visit, to improving the monitoring of, and reporting on, the significant deficiencies that raise safety concerns, and to following up and monitoring its observations after inspection visits.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We voted this week in the European Parliament on whether or not to grant discharge to the budgets of European institutions and agencies for 2010. I voted in favour of discharge for the 2010 budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency. Discharge is the final approval of the EU budget for a given year. Following the audit and the finalisation of the annual accounts, it falls on the Council of the European Union to make a recommendation and then it is up to us, the MEPs, to decide whether or not to grant discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the EU budget for the preceding financial year. This decision is based, in part, on a review of the annual accounts and on the Court of Auditors’ annual report. Discharge is therefore the political element of the external control of budget implementation.</p>

In its conclusions, the Court of Auditors noted deficiencies in staff selection procedures, which put at risk the transparency of recruitment, and the agency must therefore take steps to remedy these deficiencies. Among a number of other things, the European Parliament has urged the agency to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts when drawing up the operational budget, to improve performance monitoring and reporting, and to attach a report to each year’s budget on the unspent appropriations carried over from previous years, explaining why those monies have not been used and how and when they will be used.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Aviation Safety Agency as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The Court of Auditors found that in the course of its audits, it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2010 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular. It must be noted that the agency must fully implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts, and must improve performance monitoring and reporting. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The events of 11 September 2001 called into question all security measures employed by civil aviation and laid bare the extent to which it is exposed to the world’s most radical and destructive agendas, and the need to adopt effective measures for defending and protecting passengers, crew and aeronautical equipment. As such, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has a mission of the utmost importance, all the more so because of increased air traffic and the ever increasing movement of people and goods. Given the small number of manufacturers of aircraft and aeronautical equipment, it is justified for Europe to be particularly concerned about the need to be careful of conflicts of interest, to preserve the impartiality of decisions made, to ensure best certification practices, and to keep in mind the main interests at stake.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the financial year 2010. The EASA was established in 2002 to create and maintain a uniformly high safety level for civil aviation throughout Europe. It is also responsible for certifying aeronautical equipment and its manufacturers. The Court of Auditors states in its report that the EASA’s annual accounts for the financial year 2010 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. However, I share the rapporteur’s view that risk assessments, monitoring and transmission of information on defects, and follow-ups to inspections need to be improved.

It is essential that the European Union, which always insists strictly on businesses and Member States adhering to the principle of free and fair competition, should itself set a good example in this area. Discrimination or preferential treatment of any kind must not be tolerated.

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Chemicals Agency as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The Court of Auditors found that it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Chemicals Agency for the financial year 2010 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular. The report calls on the agency to inform the discharge authority of the steps taken to improve its control system by strengthening its financial circuits, workflows, action plans and risk assessments. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for the financial year 2010. The purpose of the Helsinki-based ECHA, founded in 2007, is to guarantee the European public’s quality of life by implementing EU regulations on chemical products, particularly by providing information and promoting the safe use of these products to help businesses to comply with legislation. The Court of Auditors states in its report that the ECHA’s annual accounts are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. However, I agree with the rapporteur that the ECHA should comply with the recommendations made to it as regards granting discharge for 2009. Thus, in view of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control and the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am voting for this report granting the Director of the ECHA discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency’s budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report, as I acknowledge that in 2010, the Internal Audit Service (IAS) conducted an audit of the ‘management plan system (MPS)/monitoring of activities’, the objective of which was to assess and provide assurance on the adequacy of the planning and monitoring of the agency’s activities. It is worth pointing out that the IAS made eight recommendations, six of which were rated ‘important’ and two ‘desirable’. It is therefore up to the agency to promote guidelines for objectives and measurable indicators in project planning and progress monitoring, to allocate project costs, and to promote more effective project management and procedures for checking and verifying new data entered into the MPS. Moreover, the agency should adopt without further delay additional measures to address the weaknesses found by the IAS in its previous audits on quality management and on grant management in order to develop and use the QA/QC checklist for the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report; to plan, describe and document relevant quality checks; to assure supervision of quality controls; to anticipate business continuity issues; to realise on-the-spot controls and verification of grants; and to monitor and follow up grant implementation.</p>

Since the agency’s Executive Director has also sat on the international consultative committee of the non-governmental organisation Earthwatch (an international environmental protection organisation), Parliament will take the time to look into the agency’s accounts in greater depth.

      <p sl="pt">Environmental protection is a modern phenomenon which has long ceased to be the sole preserve of a particular ideology or political family. Today, this concern with environmental conservation is common to most developed societies, and reflects the extent to which they are facing up to the need to adapt their growth to their sustainability. As a collective and fundamental third-generation right, the environment deserves unanimity over its protection, even though there are many doubts and alternative views on the appropriate measures to be taken in specific cases and areas. The European Environment Agency is responsible for advising on the best decisions to be taken, and it must be capable of conducting independent assessments that are not subject to any one agenda. In addition to fiscal discipline, therefore, particular care is also needed in relation to situations where there are conflicts of interest, and counterproductive, militant stances should be rejected.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the financial year 2010. The EEA, which was created in 1993, currently has 32 members: the 27 EU Member States, and also Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Turkey. Its goal is to ‘help the Community and member countries make informed decisions about improving the environment’. The Court of Auditors stated in its report on the accounts of the EEA that ‘it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts for the financial year 2010 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular’. I welcome the high level of implementation of the budget in terms of committed appropriations (100%) and payment appropriations (90.75%), and while I understand the need for the agency to improve its performance, particularly by including objectives and measurable indicators, I am voting against this report, as I believe that, as has been done in relation to other agencies, the Executive Director of the EEA should also be granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency’s budget for 2010, in line with the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report on the 2010 discharge for the European Environment Agency provided for postponement of the discharge. I certainly voted for the postponement of the discharge, which I proposed as rapporteur. I have serious concerns towards this agency with regard to conflicts of interest, public procurement, transparency and the way it spends the EU taxpayers’' money. In 2010, the agency built a green façade that lasted only 5 months, but cost more than EUR 294 000, and yet no public tender was made. The agency will also spend EUR 250 000 for media monitoring in the next 4 years. This is excessive, unjustified and disregards the taxpayers’ money. Conflicts of interest are a major problem in the agency. In 2010, while the EEA Executive Director was a member of the International Board of Directors of Earthwatch, 29 staff members of the agency, including the Executive Director, went for up to 10 days of research on different biodiversity projects in the Caribbean or Mediterranean managed by Earthwatch to whom the agency paid a total of EUR 33 791.28.

      <p sl="sv">The error range in respect of the use of EU funds within the Cohesion Fund and the energy/transport funds increased by 7.7% in 2010. Deficiencies in the public procurement procedure accounted for a large proportion of this. Common funds that are not used as intended represent a problem. When it comes to the management of common funds, the EU institutions must set a good example themselves, particularly at the current time in view of what financial mismanagement has led to in large parts of Europe. I therefore decided to vote in favour of the postponement of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Environment Agency for 2010. The rapporteur has indicated a number of areas in which deficiencies have been found: a conflict of interest on the part of the Executive Director which may have had a substantial effect on the agency’s work, the procurement of services that was not carried out correctly and the incorrect use of EU funds. It bears mentioning here that the issue at hand is the postponement of discharge. The European Environment Agency has demonstrated compliance on many points, and the quality of the supporting research reports produced is good.

Unfortunately, this is not the only actual, proven case of conflicts of interest at this agency. For example, certain senior managers have joined pro-GMO companies after leaving the EFSA or, conversely, now have managerial responsibilities at the EFSA after having belonged to pro-GMO lobbies. These conflicts of interest must stop. Agencies that we believe to be independent and that were set up to provide opinions and issue authorisations with complete impartiality must not come under the thumb of any interests within the industry. We have called a halt to this today by a majority in Parliament and we will await the Court of Auditors’ report in June before voting again in October on discharge for the budgets of the agencies in question.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Parliament has decided not to grant budget discharge to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), as its costs were considered too high and conflicts of interest have been identified. As a member of the Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I have personally witnessed the level of media scrutiny which the EFSA has, quite rightly, undergone, with the resignation of the chair of its management board, Diána Bánáti, who has taken up a post as the head of a major agri-food industry lobby. This move has given rise to a good deal of criticism, especially since Ms Bánáti’s links with the industry have been known for a long time. When asked about the matter on Thursday, the Commission said it was sorry that Ms Bánáti had moved straight from the EFSA to the lobby. Although this move is not illegal as such, it is certainly not in keeping with the agency’s spirit of independence. The vote in Parliament today therefore sends out a very important signal that conflicts of interest with industry are not and will not be tolerated.</p>

The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The discharge report points out that a number of cases of conflicts of interest within the authority were revealed recently, and in order to facilitate the clarification of these and to promote the efficiency and economy of the authority’s management, the Committee does not recommend the granting of discharge for the time being. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to postpone the granting of discharge, as it found that in order for the authority to be granted discharge, some additional issues concerning its 2010 management needed to be clarified.

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the financial year 2010. The EFSA was created with the aim of improving food safety throughout the EU and ensuring a high level of protection for consumers, so that they can trust European food products. It is therefore involved at every stage of the food chain, from food safety for animals intended for human consumption to plant protection and plant health. The Court of Auditors stated in its report on the EFSA’s annual accounts that ‘it has obtained reasonable assurance that the annual accounts for the financial year 2010 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular’. Thus, in spite of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control and the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and in view of the recommendations by the Ombudsman, I am voting for this report postponing granting the Executive Director of the EFSA discharge in respect of the implementation of the authority’s budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

We believe that reports of potential conflicts of interest and, in particular, the ‘revolving door’ cases mentioned by the Ombudsman in his annual report, are sufficient grounds to request that discharge be postponed until these cases are fully cleared up. The report ‘underlines that the Ombudsman concluded that the authority had not carried out a thorough assessment of the alleged potential conflict of interest and called on the authority to improve the way in which it applies its rules and procedures in future ‘revolving door’ cases; stresses, moreover, that the Ombudsman also observed that negotiations by a serving member of staff concerning a future job which could amount to a ‘revolving door’ situation would themselves constitute a conflict of interest and recommended that the authority should strengthen its rules and procedures accordingly; calls on the authority to inform the discharge authority of the concrete measures adopted, and their respective deadlines, to properly address the conclusions of the Ombudsman’.

These delays concern information security management, the contract renewal process, transparency of decision making, and filing and archiving policy, and the authority is therefore urged to rapidly address these deficiencies and to inform the discharge authorities of the results achieved. I also believe that product assessment should not be based solely on industry data, but should duly take into account independent scientific literature published in peer-reviewed journals. Extra caution should be exercised in relation to industry influence in the development of guidelines and assessment methodologies, which should not favour industry-sponsored studies on speculative grounds, and which should be developed in an open, transparent and balanced manner.

I certainly voted in favour of this report, as rapporteur and the one who proposed the postponement of the discharge. The costs of the agency’s management board are excessive although it is composed of only 15 members. In 2010, each meeting cost, on average, EUR 92 630, which represents an amount of EUR 6 175 per member. The decisions of the agency are repeatedly challenged over cases of conflicts of interest involving members of the management board and members of the experts’ panels, who come from or go to the food industry, or even are in both places at the same time. For instance, in September 2010, the chair of the management board was reported to be a member of the Board of Directors of the International Life Science Institute (ILSI) – Europe, a food lobby group, from where she stepped down in October 2010, only to accept a professional position at ILSI on 8 May 2012.

The European Court of Auditors expressed no reservations regarding the reliability of the EFSA’s accounts or the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. As for the Internal Audit Service (IAS), none of its recommendations were ‘critical’: the recommendations that give the most cause for concern. Furthermore, I do not think the rapporteur took a very useful approach by talking about ‘alleged conflicts of interest’ in her report. The agency has put in place rules to prevent possible conflicts of interest, but it also needs the expertise of officers who have worked in the private sector. The fact that some experts have had previous experience in the private sector does not mean they are not performing their new duties objectively. It should be proven that this is not the case before we condemn the agency in this way. The report provides no such proof.</p>

Indeed, I think that the role played by the European Food Safety Authority is extremely important for consumer health and that it should in no way be put at risk of any conflicts of interest that could arise in the event that the independence of its members is put in doubt. I cannot, therefore, vote in favour of the amendment to the motion for a resolution that removes the requirement for the Food Safety Authority to see a conflict of interest in the current or recent past participation of its management board, panel and working group members or staff in International Life Service Institute activities, such as taskforces, scientific committees or chairs for conferences. The independence of the members of the authority is a fundamental requirement for them to be able to act with the sole aim of protecting the health of EU citizens and that of citizens of third countries.</p>

For those reasons, the majority of the budgetary commitments had to be carried forward to 2011, as stated in the institute’s annual activity report.

Secondly, it is important for this institute to remain in Lithuania. Our relatively young democratic and conservative society needs the European Union to stress gender equality through the work of its agency in Vilnius.

This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) for the financial year 2010. The EIGE is a European agency designed to support the Member States and the European institutions in promoting equality between men and women.

      <p sl="en">The European Institute for Gender Equality is an EU agency which supports the EU and its Member States in their efforts to promote gender equality, to fight discrimination based on sex, and to raise awareness about gender equality issues. Its tasks are to collect and analyse comparable data on gender issues, to develop methodological tools, in particular, for the integration of the gender dimension in all policy areas, to facilitate the exchange of best practices and dialogue among stakeholders, and to raise awareness among EU citizens. The work of this institute is very important. Therefore, I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="et">I agreed that the budget of the European Institute for Gender Equality for 2010 should be implemented. The institute was established in 2006 and only became autonomous in June 2010, which means that the institution was only autonomous for half of the financial year in question, and that must be taken into consideration in discussing the sustainability of the European Institute for Gender Equality.</p>
      <p sl="et">In contrast to my group, I decided to support the continuation of the European Institute for Gender Equality as an autonomous body, and I do not support its incorporation into any other institution for cost-cutting purposes. In 2006, we considered it necessary to create the institute, and it is premature to make decisions regarding the institution’s efficiency or the achievement of its objectives, since the final establishment procedures were only completed in 2010, and several positions that are important for the institute’s work remain vacant. The European Institute for Gender Equality and its work are important in dealing with issues of gender equality at European Union level, and we should not create any restrictions or hindrances to the development of this institution.</p>

Furthermore, April 2012 saw the adoption of a new revision of the policy on managing conflicts of interest among members of its scientific and expert committees, alongside a disciplinary procedure for the abuse of trust by members of committees and experts.

I welcome the fact that the European Parliament report contains important recommendations for the agency, such as taking steps to remedy deficiencies identified in procurement procedures, verifying whether all the actions specified in the audit reports, including those for 2010, were fully implemented, providing central control and coordination for the development of an experts’ assessment methodology and effectively addressing potential conflicts of interest. However, I do not agree that the European Parliament should postpone discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency’s budget for 2010 on account of these deficiencies because similar deficiencies were identified in a number of other agencies to which the European Parliament has granted discharge, and which have been urged by it to address the deficiencies identified.</p>

The discharge report notes that the main issue with the European Medicines Agency is that its management board has yet to approve the action plan drafted during last year’s discharge procedure to remedy existing issues. The report points out that a number of cases of conflicts of interest within the agency were revealed recently, and the Committee does not recommend granting discharge until these are clarified. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to postpone the granting of discharge, as it found that in order for the authority to be granted discharge, some additional issues concerning its 2010 management needed to be clarified.

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the financial year 2010. The EMA, which was created in 1993 but only became operational in 1995, is aimed at protecting and promoting public and animal health by evaluating and supervising medicines for human or veterinary use. No medicine can be marketed without this agency’s assent. The Court of Auditors’ report, despite making some observations on carryovers, IT contracts and the payment system, considered that the accounts of the EMA for the financial year 2010 ‘are reliable, legal and regular’. Thus, in view of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am voting against this report, as I believe that, as with the other agencies, the Director of the EMA should also be granted discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency’s budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

It also calls on the EMA to inform Parliament ‘of the way in which it ensures that procedures for the involvement of experts are fully applied until the Memoranda of Understanding on the independence of scientific evaluation have been signed by all national competent authorities’.

I certainly voted in favour of this report as rapporteur and the one who proposed the postponement of the discharge. During the 2009 discharge procedure, the European Parliament requested a multiannual procurement plan from EMA, which has not yet been adopted. Moreover, the management board refused a new payment system for the agency, hence the management board accepts and takes direct responsibility for very important risks, such as non-compliance with legislative requirements, the potential financial impact of the current remuneration system, as well as reputation. Serious weaknesses in terms of conflicts of interest also remain. Its approach on the scrutiny of declarations of interest is based on trust rather than on verification of the experts’ declaration of interest published by the relevant national agencies. A genuine mechanism enabling proper scrutiny of the declarations of interest recently adopted by the agency must be implemented and show concrete results. The CV of its experts should be made available on its website. Consumers and, at the same time, taxpayers should be aware of who, how and why drugs are recommended and used by citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Macovei, concerns discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) for the financial year 2010. The EMCDDA, which is based in Lisbon, aims to provide politicians with information enabling them to make the best decisions. Its mission is to gather, analyse and handle objective and reliable data on the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction in Europe. The Court of Auditors’ report, despite having made a number of observations, stated that it has obtained ‘reasonable assurance’ that the accounts were ‘reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular’. However, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs takes the view that the EMCDDA needs to consolidate its financial management and improve its relationship with the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs. Therefore, and in view of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am voting for this report granting the Director of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction discharge in respect of the implementation of the centre’s budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2010 because discharge is granted to the centre’s Director in respect of the implementation of the centre’s budget for 2010 and approval is given to the closure of its 2010 accounts. The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the financial year 2010 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, but the centre must consolidate its financial management. Drug-related issues must be adequately represented in the new multiannual financial framework (2014-2020). The centre still needs to implement five very important recommendations from the Internal Audit Service (IAS) audits on grant management (2009) and on Preparedness for the Move (2008). For three very important recommendations, implementation is delayed beyond the date defined by the centre in its original action plan. The centre implemented one more recommendation at the end of 2010 and a follow-up by the IAS with the purpose of confirming its effective implementation is now awaited. The centre must take immediate steps to redress the situation and inform the discharge authority of the measures taken.</p>

The first 11 ‘very important’ recommendations concern the legal and financial decision-making process, human resources management and internal control standards.

      <p sl="lt">I welcomed discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) for 2010. There is concern over the large proportion of appropriations constantly carried forward by the EMSA, and the fact that the agency’s procurement procedures are not transparent. If the EMSA does not have underlying data to take a financing decision on planned operational procurement, then this may pose a risk to the validity of the agency’s decision. I welcome the calls for the agency to include in its annual work programme (AWP) clear information on the global budgetary envelope provided for procurements and an indication of the number and the types of contracts. It is also important for the agency to implement 15 very important recommendations from the Internal Audit Service as soon as possible.

The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The Court of Auditors found that in the course of its audits, it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2010 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular. The report calls on the agency to apply procurement procedures correctly; however, it welcomes the fact that in its 2009 annual activity report, the agency included a specific annex on negotiated procedures in order to inform the budgetary authority. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

The Court of Auditors’ report, despite having made a number of observations, stated that it has obtained ‘reasonable assurance’ that the accounts were ‘reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular’. I welcome the fact that the Court of Auditors has not criticised the budgetary and financial management of the EMSA, as has happened in the past, and I urge the agency to continue improving its performance, financial management and control, as recommended in the 2009 discharge report. In view of the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control and the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am voting for this report granting the Executive Director of the EMSA discharge in respect of the implementation of the agency’s budget for the financial year 2010.</p>

We draw the agency’s attention to the resolution of the European Parliament of May 2011 on the 2009 discharge regarding performance, financial management and control of EU agencies, and we urge the agency to comply with this resolution’s recommendations. As part of the resolution, Parliament has asked the agency to carry out the following: to produce a Gantt chart as part of the programming for each of its operational activities; to set out a diachronic analysis of operations subject to discharge carried out in this and previous years; to improve its planning and monitoring in order to reduce the number of budget transfers; and to apply public procurement procedures correctly.</p>

As we renegotiate the agency’s mandate, I hope we will take care to ensure that its future activities are both useful and cost-effective and that it therefore remains a high value added European resource. We need to be realistic in particular, and only ask the agency to do what it is able to do, particularly at a time of budgetary cuts. Personally, I feel these new roles should tie in with the agency’s key mission, which is to preserve both the security and safety and the environment of the EU’s maritime areas.

The agency faces increased risks in its planning, accounting, budget execution, IT development and management, business continuity, stakeholder relations, external communication, and impact assessment and evaluation, and the agency must therefore promptly establish the necessary measures to reduce the risks in the abovementioned subjects. The agency has implemented four very important recommendations related to the 2009 audit on procurement.</p>

There is concern that the European Railway Agency (ERA) is carrying over a high number of appropriations to the following year, thus breaching the principle of annuality.

Furthermore, in 2010, there were cases of cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, as well as recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes to the work programme. I welcome the European Parliament’s recommendations to address the problem of appropriations being carried forward as soon as possible, ensure effective procurement procedures, create a consolidated recruitment procedure, draw up a multiannual action plan with tasks and key performance indicators, and implement the other recommendations made by the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament.</p>

The European Court of Auditors found that in the course of its audits, it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the agency for the financial year 2010 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular.

The ERA, which is based in Lille, France, has the aim of cooperating with the rail sector in order to develop techniques and safety measures to harmonise European rail systems, ensure that they are economically viable, improve safety and allow trains to run between the Member States without having to stop at borders. The Court of Auditors’ report states that it has obtained ‘reasonable assurances’ that the accounts are ‘reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular’. I welcome the fact that the criticism made by the Court of Auditors of the accounting and budget for the financial year 2009 has been heeded.

The agency helps integrate railway systems in Europe by reinforcing the safety of rail transport and providing the opportunity to cross EU Member States’ borders without stopping. The agency cooperates with the rail sector, national authorities, EU institutions and other bodies on drafting technical standards, as well as common, cost-effective safety measures and objectives. The agency also issues reports on railway safety in the EU and coordinates the efforts aimed at devising standard signalling regulations throughout Europe. Achieving the most cost-effective use of budget funds is of paramount importance during the current financial crisis. We urge the Commission and agency to examine and define the real budgetary requirements for carrying out the tasks under the agency’s remit. We should mention that the agency has already carried over a substantial amount of funds from the 2008 and 2009 financial years to the following year. We think that these serious breaches of the budgetary principle of annuality are no longer acceptable in future and that, if the relevant budgetary principle is breached again, discharge should not be granted next time.

Whilst the legality of the expenditure has been ascertained, and whilst I fully share the ERA’s objective of making Europe’s railway network more interoperable, I do not think it is right that the agency should carry forward from one year to the next sums that have been allocated strictly for the implementation of its annual budget. The agency carried forward over EUR 5 million from the 2010 financial year to the 2011 financial year, having already acted in a similar way from 2008 to 2009. This practice, which goes against the principle of annual budgeting periods, must not become a habit and will no longer be tolerated at a time when public expenditure must be rationalised and set an example. It is essential that the ERA take on board the criticisms made by this House, which it had already made in 2010; otherwise, it risks the House exercising its powers as a budgetary authority to penalise it.</p>

I welcome the call for the agency to take all necessary steps to prevent a repeat of this situation. In 2010, the agency’s budget was increased by 17.44%. Usually, a large proportion of appropriations carried over or cancelled means that the agency is unable to manage an increased budget. I agree that there should be a greater focus on absorption capacity and welcome the call for the annual budget for the agency to be reduced unless it takes structural action to address this issue.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The Court of Auditors found that in its audits, it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2010 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular. It is important for the agency to improve its budgetary and recruitment planning in line with Parliament’s recommendation in order to address the lack of consistency between its budgetary and staff forecasting. The discharge report found that the financial audit had been completed properly and that the inspection had revealed no major deficiencies. At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010. I supported the granting of discharge at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The problem of maritime piracy has been growing constantly since 2008 – attacks are increasing each year, the arms used by pirates are becoming technologically more advanced, attacks are becoming more coordinated and ransom demands are growing in size. It should be noted that without the efforts of the international community and the EU Atalanta operation, this problem would probably be even more widespread and out of control. Instances where ships transporting military technology fall into the pirates’ hands are particularly worrying. Piracy impedes international trade, poses a threat to the transportation of strategic and environmentally dangerous cargos, increases costs (the cost of insuring ships alone has increased tenfold), may cause an environmental disaster (oil spills from ships, for example), exacerbates the destabilisation of countries and regions, halts development and, above all, regularly costs innocent lives. There can be no justification for piracy. This activity is an international crime and could be compared to terrorist activity. I voted in favour of this resolution because I believe the fight against maritime piracy must continue to be strengthened.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today in Parliament, we voted on a motion for a resolution on an issue that has been very sensitive over recent years: maritime piracy. The European Parliament, having regard to UN Security Council Resolution 1 816 of 2 June 1968 and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, wishes to express its disappointment with the Member States, which reduced the number of vessels supplied for the EU NAVFOR Atalanta operation from eight to only two or three at the beginning of 2012, and therefore calls on the Member States to ‘provide more naval assets to enable the Atalanta operation to succeed’. The House has also formally called on the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, as well as the Member States, to urgently find a way to liberate the 191 seafarers still being held hostage and to secure the release of the seven hijacked vessels. I hope that this vote sends a strong, powerful message, enabling the Member States and competent EU bodies to find better solutions to a problem which, especially in recent years, has been afflicting boats and people from all over the world.</p>

I agree that there should be a greater focus on absorption capacity and welcome the call for the annual budget for the agency to be reduced unless it takes structural action to address this issue.

      <p sl="hu">Following the presentation of the European Court of Auditors’ annual report for the financial year 2010, the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control carried out the financial audit of the European Union general budget in respect of the European GNSS Agency as part of the 2010 discharge procedure. The Committee’s primary responsibility is to ensure and verify that the Community budget is implemented in a regular and efficient manner. The Court of Auditors found that in the course of its audits, it had obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the agency for the financial year 2010 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular. In 2011, the agency took the steps required by the European Parliament to guarantee transparency, equal treatment, and effectiveness in its staff selection procedures.

At its meeting in late March, the Committee decided to grant discharge and to close the accounts for 2010.

However, the agency is urged to rectify the deficiencies identified by the Court of Auditors in the evaluation process as regards the FP7/Galileo/Second Call grant procedures which have a budget of EUR 26 000 000. Above all, there is acknowledgement of the Court of Auditors’ observations, according to which the criteria for assessing the applicants’ financial capacity were not defined and although the status of the applicant determined the maximum reimbursement rate, such status was not verified by the agency. However, the agency is urged to remedy the weaknesses found by the Court of Auditors on two grant agreements within the Sixth Research Framework Programme (FP6)/Third Call. It is noted, in particular, that the cost claims submitted by the beneficiaries were based on standard rates, instead of actual costs.

If not, I call on the Commission to assess other methods of initiating investigations in areas where suspected fraud is concealed under the ‘laws of criminal silence’, which prevent information leaking through whistle-blowers or informants. I believe that Member States are failing to provide data in a timely manner, or that the data they do provide is inaccurate and does not stand up to comparison, thus making it impossible to evaluate objectively the true scale of fraud in the Member States.

      <p sl="lt">I am delighted that my MEP colleagues have approved the report I prepared on combating fraud in the European Union. According to data provided by the Commission, EUR 120 billion is lost to fraud every year in the EU, but the true scale of fraud in the EU is simply unknown because of the absence of reliable data. From 1989, when the Commission began to provide the European Parliament and the Council with annual reports, until the present, it is safe to say that neither the Commission nor the institution responsible for combating fraud – OLAF – have had reliable data from the Member States about the true scale of fraud. This is acknowledged by the Commission itself, which states in its annual report that the data it provides in its annual report must be interpreted with caution. I believe that this situation must be changed fundamentally. One of the main provisions in the report adopted by Parliament states that the Commission must take full responsibility for recovering unduly paid EU funds and for the collection of correct, necessary and comparable data from the Member States, thereby enabling us to have accurate and correct data in future which would allow the extent of fraud in the Member States to be assessed objectively and help combat the illegal use of EU funds more effectively.</p>

In view of the interconnected nature of the EU economies, I consider it important for Member States to cooperate in looking for ways to limit the grey economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I abstained from this vote as, while I concur that fraud regarding Member State usage of funding must be tackled, it raises a number of concerns. In certain instances, what Brussels deems to be ‘irregularities’ are punitive measures that simply return funding back to Brussels based upon an illogical and unjust rationale, and indeed funding that I believe should not necessarily exist in the first place. Most often, necessary data from the Member States is not collected, making it impossible to establish the actual scale of fraud. There is also a high incidence of fraud within the EU institutions. As a Member of Parliament who opposes the majority of the EU’s functions, I do not endorse many of the funds and regulations to which such anti-fraud measures are attached.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The 2010 discharge procedure included the preparation of the annual report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests and the fight against fraud. As shadow rapporteur for the motion, I support the rapporteur, who provided an appropriate presentation of the efforts made in 2010 by the European Commission, OLAF and the Member States to protect the Community’s financial interests and strengthen the regularity of the use of Community resources. The report also gives an accurate description of those areas where further steps need to be taken or where the efforts made so far have been unsuccessful. 2010 saw an increase in the number of irregularities discovered in almost all budgetary areas, the sole exception being the pre-accession funds and traditional own resources. In relation to the expenditure side of the whole budget, the ratio of irregularities resulting from fraud rose from 0.13% to 0.34%. In 2009, cases of fraud accounted for only EUR 180 million, whereas in 2010, this figure increased to EUR 478 million. The highest number of irregularities reported occur in the implementation phase, while in terms of value, they are highest in the selection and procurement phases. A more transparent and more flexible public procurement system could prevent an enormous number of errors. It is the duty of the Commission to implement the reform of the public procurement system. I supported the adoption of the report at both the Committee vote and the vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Fraud is an example of purposeful wrongdoing and is a criminal offence, while an irregularity is a failure to comply with a rule. It must therefore be heavily penalised to limit it as much as possible.

The report states that in 2010, the financial impact of irregularities in the area of expenditure rose and amounted to EUR 1.8 billion. This means that funds are still being misspent and mismanaged, so measures must be taken to hold Member States more accountable for irregularities and to improve the prevention and detection thereof.

According to the report, ‘In 2010, reports of irregularities increased in all sectors, with the exception of the pre-accession funds and traditional own resources’. Despite implementing an Irregularities Management System (IMS), managed by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), some Member States do not update their data, making the system less effective. The Commission must therefore take all necessary steps, using legislative initiative where required, to obtain data in a timely manner on the level of irregularities and fraud in the Member States.

      <p sl="pt">The report notes that in 2010, the overall financial impact of irregularities detected by control systems amounted to EUR 2 193 million, up from 2009. According to the European Court of Auditors (ECA), the control systems were found to be only partially effective in ensuring the regularity of payments.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The ECA considers that, in the majority of cases, the Member States’ authorities had sufficient information available to have detected and corrected at least some of the errors before payments were made. There is therefore room for improvement. The rapporteur’s main criticism focuses on the lack of reliable statistical data on the extent of fraud and corruption, on the extent of tax and customs duty evasion, and on misuse of EU funds by organised crime; Parliament has repeatedly requested this data from the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This means that the Commission is unable to assess the actual scale of irregularities and fraud in the EU, or to distinguish between individual cases.

The report also examines a special topic, agreed in advance between the Commission and the Member States, namely, the risk of double financing in cohesion policy. In my opinion, the current rules do not always provide appropriate and sufficient means to identify and prevent the misuse of EU funds, and by this I mean, for example, the differences in relevant Member State regulations, in particular as regards sanctions applied for fraud. One such barrier is that regulations concerning procedures, crime and punishments vary by Member State, which acts as an impediment to fraud-related investigations and criminal proceedings across Member States. In the interest of coordinating Member State regulations, I still find the establishment of a uniform legislative background necessary. However, considering the differences that exist between Member States, it is questionable whether detailed rules falling within Member State competence could actually be harmonised and, most of all, in how far the individual countries would consent to this. I believe that the rapporteur is correct in stating that the Commission’s annual reports are based on inaccurate and non-comparable data, and that this raises questions about their purpose overall.

      <p sl="it">There is no sign of a let up in the current prevalence and significance of illegal economic and financial behaviour. Financial fraud is widespread in many EU Member States and, in some cases, during 2010, some 90% of the cases reported by the EU were labelled as ‘suspected fraud’. However, illegal financial practices also include the use of EU funds, which are often managed badly, inefficiently and with a huge number of grey areas by the regional administrations of the Member States. I have tried many times to urge national institutions to take steps to resolve the problem. Putting greater controls on transactions is certainly a good starting point, but it is not enough: we need to spread a culture of legality and raise awareness of payment methods that move increasingly towards the use of e -money.</p>

Many challenges remain. Member States should be made more accountable for the amount in irregularities that remain to be recovered; the Commission and the Member States should apply uniform systems of procurement, define and implement clear conditions for participation in public procurement, as well as transparency in criteria and decision making on public procurement. We also need one-stop transparency: we need a single website that publishes all the beneficiaries of EU funds on the basis of standard categories of information to be supplied by all the Member States in at least one working language of the Union.

In 2010, the total financial impact of irregularities was EUR 2 193 million, compared with EUR 1 757 million in the previous year. A worrying trend is the reduction in revenues, especially due to VAT losses, which account, on average, for 12% of the losses, and lost customs duties. In my opinion, we must introduce effective countermeasures, as this reduces the actual amount of funds available for Member States to spend. I am in favour of an increase in the EU budget, and expenditure should be directed mainly at achieving greater equality in standards of living. This is particularly important for countries such as Poland, which, admittedly, is developing ever faster, but which still needs enormous efforts and resources to reach the EU average. I would therefore like to emphasise that any irregularities tolerated in the generation of the EU’s joint revenues are, in fact, to the detriment of those countries that entered the Union in recent years.</p>

The high charges currently applied to mobile devices – which are a significant expense for users and especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – are unjustifiable and stand in stark contrast to the digital age we live in and to free movement. At long last, with the new rules coming in on 1 July, roaming charges will fall drastically and users will be able to travel within European borders free to choose and purchase different services from various operators, with clear and transparent information at hand.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The cost of using a mobile phone abroad is still well above the cost of domestic communications. Thus, Angelika Niebler’s text was adopted by an overwhelming majority. This text illustrates how Europe is working to help the everyday consumer. Following tough negotiations, the ‘roaming’ regulation will, from July onwards, force mobile phone operators in Europe to charge the same prices and less than the prices currently being charged. The text introduces, for the first time ever, structural solutions that will enable consumers to freely choose another operator for roaming services, independent of their domestic operator. The text provides for the temporary application of new caps on retail and wholesale tariffs for voice, SMS and, in particular, data services. To quote Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda: ‘We now have a ‘future-proof’ solution. Injecting competition into roaming markets will mean, for the first time ever, a structural, sustainable way to protect consumers, because competition is the best guarantee of long-term low prices’.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I welcome this report. The low level of use of roaming services within the EU is not in the interests of the European economy and is incompatible with the fundamental idea of a European digital single market. In order to reduce the often high data roaming charges, it is very important to boost competition between operators and thus encourage them to offer customers more attractive prices. It is very important to reduce the current wholesale and retail price caps for voice and SMS services and introduce a retail price cap for mobile data services. The regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Community currently in force will expire in June and I therefore welcome its recast and the proposals it contains. I agree with the lower prices proposed by Parliament: EUR 0.24 a minute for outgoing calls, EUR 0.10 for incoming calls, EUR 0.10 for text messages and EUR 0.50 per megabyte for downloading data and surfing the Internet abroad.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report tackles a central issue in the area of consumer rights and the freedom of communication and circulation of information and news, and I therefore welcome it. Exorbitant charges for international roaming services with minimal transparency and information on costs is probably caused by the fact that the devices market has developed very quickly compared with the system of operators, and especially compared with the onset of a modern business culture. The creation of a euro tariff is therefore to be welcomed, not only as a way to protect consumer rights, but, above all, as a way to set a benchmark and provide an incentive for the market. Achieving the political objective of aligning roaming charges by 2015, as per the Digital Agenda for Europe, looks difficult without robust incentives and accompanying measures. In this sense, and in a liberal and market-oriented view, greater information and guaranteed freedom for consumers to choose between a number of operators will act as a driver, including by way of allowing mobile telephone operators to access wholesale roaming services, thereby injecting greater competition into the market.</p>

I am also sure that the proposals set out in the report can make an effective contribution to the development of a competitive European digital market, making it easier for new and alternative operators to access the wholesale market.

I do, however, regret the decision not to adopt the amendment that would have blocked phone companies charging users roaming costs for calls made within an area of 10 km from the border of the country where the phone contract was entered into. This amendment would have avoided the unfair application of roaming costs for calls made in municipalities bordering other countries and would also have lessened usage costs for cross-border workers, such as citizens resident in Italy but employed in Swiss businesses near the Italian border.</p>

Healthy competition has not yet developed, and customers continue to pay unreasonably high prices. The report on developments in the market for roaming services states that current charges (with the exception of specific tariffs) are not sufficiently flexible for users to avoid paying unreasonably high prices in relation to competitive domestic tariffs.

In order to get closer to this goal, it is necessary to find a solution which guarantees competition and effective functioning of the roaming market also after the set date. The efforts put into the roll-out of broadband networks could also support the emergence of tools which can be an alternative to roaming services. The new regulation (Roaming III) continues to regulate roaming charges for calls and text messages and introduces a new essential element: a euro data tariff for retail data roaming services. The proposal also introduces a number of structural measures to boost competition while price caps are maintained as a ‘safety net’ for consumers to cover the period until competition itself drives the prices down. It must be emphasised that from 1 July 2014, customers will be allowed to sign up for a mobile roaming contract separate from the national mobile service contract. This will encourage competition on the roaming market and is a possible way forward for development.

Competition in the mobile roaming sector within the EU is still weak, leading to very high prices for consumers. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached at first reading on a text which I am sure provides effective solutions for improving the situation in the mobile roaming market for European consumers. Firstly, separating the provision of mobile phone services on national territory from roaming services will improve competition, as consumers will be able to choose whether they wish to keep the same communications provider while travelling and benefit from more attractive pricing. Secondly, gradually capping the maximum allowed charges made when billing for voice, SMS and data services between now and 2014 will be hugely beneficial to consumers. Furthermore, consumers will benefit from numerous measures improving transparency, such as the provision of information on roaming tariffs outside the EU, information on accumulated consumption expressed in the unit or currency of billing, and the introduction of safeguard caps (EUR 50 by default).</p>

      <p sl="pl">The number of persons who make telephone calls, send text messages or browse the web while abroad is constantly increasing. Unfortunately, prices for these types of services are very high and there is still minimal competition in this market. These very high roaming tariffs do not benefit either consumers or the European economy. I believe that the ability to make calls or send data at favourable prices is closely linked to mobility. If we want greater mobility of citizens in the European Union, then we must make sure that excessively high charges do not stand in the way of using mobile telephones. Unfortunately, many Europeans switch off their telephones when travelling to another Member State because they are afraid of high phone bills. Telecommunications should become part of the internal market, but we will only be able to speak of such a market when roaming tariffs are at the same level as national tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am in favour of systematic reductions in roaming tariffs, and this objective will gradually be achieved over the coming years. Today, Parliament has approved roaming charges that are much lower than those proposed by the European Commission. I am pleased that Parliament has been more ambitious on this issue. The regulation as adopted today will provide greater protection for consumers, and measures have also been introduced to stimulate competition.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The cost of mobile communications is about to drop. This was the decision made by Parliament on Thursday 10 May and I am delighted. The report on mobile phone roaming provides for a number of measures benefiting the consumer and virtual operators, who are restricted to using networks owned by other operators. Among the key measures, we should note the lower price caps for voice, SMS and data roaming services. From 2012, the price per minute for an outgoing call will be EUR 0.29 instead of EUR 0.35, for incoming calls EUR 0.08 instead of EUR 0.11, as it is currently, and for SMS EUR 0.09 instead of EUR 0.15. A one megabyte download will be capped at EUR 0.70, while there had been no previous price cap until now. Consumers living in border regions who are billed for inadvertent roaming must be informed by their provider of ways to avoid this inconvenience. When users travel abroad, they will be able to access local data services and choose the most favourable offer from different local providers, as for Wi-Fi.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of a regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union because most Europeans turn off their mobile phones when abroad, fearful of receiving a huge bill when they get home because this is what often happens when using a mobile phone abroad. Only 19% (the minority) of those who use their mobile phone to surf the Internet while abroad believe that roaming charges for data transport are acceptable. According to the Commission, the average cost per megabyte is currently more than EUR 2, but can, in extreme cases, be as much as EUR 12. This sorry state of affairs is largely due to the fact that there is still not enough competition on the roaming market. Excessive roaming tariffs and the consequent low level of use of roaming services within the EU are neither in the interests of European consumers nor the European economy. This development is incompatible with the fundamental idea of a European digital single market. This proposal for a regulation is therefore intended to rectify this situation. In its 2010 Digital Agenda for Europe, the Commission set the objective of bringing roaming tariffs into line with those for domestic mobile services by 2015. In addition to the planned structural measures, further efforts are needed to ensure transparency. Above all, there is a need for understandable information on the new options and tariffs now available to customers as a result of the decoupling measure. In future, roaming contracts should be set out in a clear and straightforward manner.</p>

      <p sl="lv">In the European Parliament’s plenary session, I supported the draft legislative resolution on the proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the European Union. I consider that roaming services in EU Member States have hitherto been too expensive and yet, as people increasingly travel to other EU Member States, their use these days is exceptionally important. It is essential that everyone should be able to use these services without worrying about excessive costs. Until now, for example, there has been no cap at all on prices for data downloading via roaming, but the new rules provide that as from 1 July 2012, such a cap must be introduced, and that these price caps for roaming are progressively reduced to EUR 0.05 (exclusive of VAT) per megabyte for data and per minute for telephone calls and to EUR 0.02 (exclusive of VAT) for SMS messages by 2014. I further consider that the new rules will also be advantageous for operators, as competition will be encouraged, by virtue of the fact that customers will be able to acquire domestic and roaming services from different operators while keeping the same number and without extra charge.</p>

      <p sl="sk">High roaming prices result from insufficient competition on the market for roaming, which, in turn, is caused by structural problems in the market. Until a solution is found in the form of effective structural measures, it will be necessary to respond with temporary price regulation. The price ceiling should, however, leave sufficient room for new operators to enter the market, thereby strengthening competition. The new regulation introduces a new element: a euro data tariff for retail data roaming services. Also, from 1 July 2014, the option will be introduced for customers to sign an agreement on the provision of mobile roaming services that is separate from domestic mobile services. The regulation will continue at least until 1 June 2016, and I have supported the text of the regulation.</p>

Indeed, the measures set out in the adopted regulation will result in a significant fall in the costs of phone calls, SMS messages and data when roaming.

European-level initiatives such as these are certainly worthwhile and welcome, bringing benefits for all citizens and consumers without causing any harm at all.

The demand and, all too often, the need to be constantly online wherever you happen to find yourself is increasing all the time. In my opinion, the roaming charges in the EU’s single market constitute an unnecessary financial burden for consumers. The only ones who profit from this are the big companies providing these mobile services. Despite the fact that we have failed to get rid of roaming charges completely, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has recorded significant successes in reducing roaming charges for calls, text messages and data. Data roaming in particular has caused serious problems for users. We constantly encounter cases where the unintentional activation of this service results in users owing large sums to mobile companies. I therefore consider it extremely important to address these problems through the fair regulation of prices for roaming services. By 2014, consumers should pay 65% less for roaming services, but I firmly believe that we will one day be able to remove these charges entirely.</p>

One example is the prices for Internet use, which will be capped at EUR 0.70/MB, and EUR 0.50/MB from 2014. This will mean that smartphones and tablets can be used without fear of incurring incredible costs. The plans for ‘more competition in the mobile communications market’ are particularly pleasing. As of 2014, customers will be able to find the cheapest provider and buy their roaming services separately, even from foreign providers. Every time you cross a border, your mobile phone will automatically switch to the network of the provider you have selected, while your phone number remains the same. Roaming charges are the only area in the EU where costs are incurred simply by crossing a border. When I consider the wage and social dumping that has resulted from the opening up of the eastern European labour markets, I can see that the internal market has not always only brought benefits.

In addition to call roaming charges, other problem areas include data communication rates, which are beyond the means of many travelling individuals, and large bills arising from insufficient information or human error. The new formulation of the regulation that is now under discussion seeks to correct those shortcomings and establishes common conditions for both roaming rates and, for instance, informing consumers in the European Union.

The Commission’s analysis on the proposal for a regulation on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union shows that the prices or the risks of incurring high costs are caused by a low level of competition in this market. There are not many mobile phone operators, which allows them to keep user costs much higher than if there were greater competition.

For example, in addition to the fixed charges set for calls and messages and in order to avoid huge bills, the rule is that the EUR 50 cut-off limit applies to all consumers who have not already opted for a different cut-off limit. Nonetheless, certain companies have still not applied the recommended charges to their consumers and complied with EU law.

Another essential aspect involves the quality of information given to consumers. From this summer, operators will also be required to inform consumers of the prices charged when they travel outside the EU. In addition, consumers can choose to have two contracts: one for domestic services and one for services abroad, keeping the same mobile phone number and having only one bill.

      <p sl="fr">The vote on mobile phone roaming this afternoon has resulted in excellent news for consumers, who will once again see their mobile phone roaming costs reduced. So-called roaming tariffs are not a deciding factor for consumers when selecting an operator, meaning that operators are having a field day, often charging prohibitively high prices, particularly in Belgium. Public sector intervention is therefore completely justified, in order to restrict these tariffs within reasonable limits, not only for voice and SMS services, but also for data roaming services. For example, the maximum price for sending an SMS abroad will be reduced by 80% over five years, gradually falling from a pre-2009 cost of EUR 0.29 to EUR 0.11 in 2009, before dropping to the capped price of EUR 0.06 in 2014, less than it costs for a user to send one SMS in Belgium! Data downloads will be capped at EUR 0.70 in July 2012, EUR 0.45 in July 2013 and EUR 0.20 in July 2014. With this news, I must point out that mobile phone tariffs in Belgium are the highest in Europe and remind you of the need for the government to act quickly to address this anomaly.</p>

The cost of using mobile phones, smartphones and tablets when travelling within the EU is set to fall drastically from 1 July this year, under the terms of an agreement with the Council adopted today. The new rules will also enable customers to buy roaming services from an operator that is not their domestic provider and open the market to new competitors, increasing competition and reducing prices. The proposal will enter into force on 1 July 2012, replacing the 2007 regulation, which expires on 30 June 2012, meaning that our citizens will be able to benefit from more favourable tariffs during their summer holidays. Parliament’s request for a lowering of roaming prices for consumers, and especially for data services, has therefore been a success. Moreover, from July 2014 onwards, consumers will be able to choose a different roaming services provider from their national operator for roaming services. These new rules will help open the market to new operators, thereby increasing competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">In favour. The objective of reducing the difference between national and roaming tariffs, which was included in the Commission’s Benchmarking Framework 2011-2015, endorsed by the i2010 High Level Group in November 2009, and included in the Commission Communication ‘A Digital Agenda for Europe’, should also remain the goal of this regulation. The planned separate sale of roaming services and domestic services should increase competition, and therefore lower the prices for customers and create an internal market for roaming services in the Union with no significant differentiation between national and roaming tariffs. Union-wide roaming services can stimulate the development of an internal telecommunications market in the Union.</p>

      <p sl="et">Today, using a mobile phone has become as ordinary and necessary as eating and drinking. At the same time, the purpose of using phones has changed – in addition to calling, mobile phones are used for sending and receiving SMSs, browsing web pages or using GPS. The number of users and services is increasing day by day. Although, in recent years, more attention has been devoted to roaming fees for mobile communications, costs for the use of call and SMS services are, unfortunately, still unreasonably high, especially for data transmission, where prices can differ several hundredfold. I am pleased to welcome this report as a further development in the European internal market. If people can move freely from one Member State to another, they must also be able to communicate freely, and for a reasonable price, and to use different mobile communication services. For this reason, I supported the adoption of this report, and look forward to a reduction in mobile communications prices.</p>

      <p sl="de">As far back as June 2007, the European Parliament passed the first regulation on roaming in German mobile communications networks. In doing so, we positively strengthened the internal market in mobile communications services. In particular, we cut the high prices for roaming considerably. However, the Commission’s July 2011 interim report showed that consumers are still not really offered tariffs lower than the maximum prices. We therefore want to strengthen competition and tackle the structural problems in the mobile communications market.</p>
      <p sl="de">The agreement in the trialogue has now delivered good results which, to some extent, provide incentives for more competition – and that means lower prices in the long term – for consumers and for market operators.</p>
      <p sl="de">For those who live in border regions, in particular, it should be emphasised that unintentional roaming will be made more difficult in the short term in that users will be informed how they can avoid these ‘expensive treats’ and use their mobile phones without roaming.</p>
      <p sl="de">It remains to be said at this juncture that this must be effected in an unbureaucratic way and that reclaims procedures must also be straightforward.</p>

      <p sl="it">The cost of using mobile phones abroad (roaming) has long been much higher than the cost of domestic calls. The new EU regulation, which we voted in favour of this morning, puts an end to such unfair pricing practices. This is a victory for this House, which has always fought on behalf of our citizens to reduce the price of phone calls made abroad and to eliminate the abusive practices of large telecoms companies. There are many positive aspects to this text, foremost among which is the fact that from 1 July 2012, the regulation will also apply if European consumers travel abroad, outside EU territory. Another huge innovation is the fact that, from 1 July 2014, consumers will be able to take out a cheaper mobile roaming contract that is separate to their contract for domestic mobile services, while retaining the same phone number. Overall, this is an excellent first-reading agreement off the back of three trialogues with the Council; through it, EU citizens can see the new strength of the post-Lisbon Parliament in decisions that have a positive influence on their daily lives.</p>

      <p sl="sk">I supported the roaming regulation with the proposed amendments because it introduces structural measures that will encourage competition. Mobile operators are the most prosperous businesses in this time of financial and economic crisis. Their massive daily advertising campaigns lure people into purchasing their services, often without publishing the prices for individual items, offering the services in packages where the consumer cannot compare prices for individual services. Mobile phones and data services have become an essential need in people’s everyday lives. All users will therefore surely welcome a reduction in prices for data services and roaming services. The approved decision has also created the possibility for consumers to choose between individual operators of mobile services.</p>

      <p sl="hu">This legislation will establish a common approach in order to ensure that in their travels within the EU, users of public mobile communication networks do not pay excessively high charges for roaming services within the EU as compared with national charges. Unfortunately, roaming tariffs continue to be unreasonably high compared to national charges, and the relationship between costs and prices is still far from what would prevail under actual competition circumstances. High tariffs impede the use of mobile devices during journeys across borders within the EU. In order to ensure a functioning internal market and the protection of consumers, we must guarantee fair roaming charges to EU citizens travelling abroad for leisure or work-related purposes. I am of the opinion that we must entirely eliminate the distinction between national and roaming tariffs as soon as possible. This proposal represents a considerable step towards this goal, as it reduces the costs of phone calls and text messages from other Member States, and compels market participants to compete in respect of data roaming as well.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In an era of communication without borders, the additional charges imposed on European consumers have become completely unjustified. Citizens who take holidays in Europe must no longer return home to find mobile phone bills that break the bank. This is also quite a bonus for all those citizens living in border regions. Most conveniently, the consumer will be able to enjoy this service without having to change their number. Finally, to stop consumers getting nasty surprises, operators will be obliged to send a message to the user containing all the tariffs applicable in the country they are entering, wherever they are in the world. European citizens currently pay too much for communications. My ultimate aim is that the consumer ends up paying a fair price. We will be carrying out a study between now and 2016, analysing the behaviour of operators following this new regulation. If we find that tariffs are still too high or that the margin between national and European services is too wide, we will introduce a new amendment procedure. For too long, real competition, which is beneficial to consumers, has been conspicuously absent. Parliament is coming to the rescue.</p>

It is therefore right that the European Parliament should intervene and set ceilings for roaming fees. This is only meant to be one step in the right direction, however, in order to ensure that competition takes hold in this area and leads to significant falls in prices, perhaps even rendering roaming fees superfluous altogether. The timing of this decision has been well chosen – it comes just before the summer tourist season gets under way.</p>

      <p sl="pt">While the aim of this draft regulation – to reduce the price of mobile roaming services – is important, it glosses over issues of sovereignty, the economy and public health, which we would like to address. While having an initial positive impact by lowering the regulated price of roaming services, the realisation of an EU internal market in this area will mean supply concentration in some transnational monopolies in the sector. This will lead to many workers losing their jobs and price increases, as seen in the realisation of internal markets in other industries. Spectrum space is increasingly being monopolised by, committed to or reserved for commercial ends, with very few exceptions. Public space is dead, with an increasingly small number of private companies dominating this public asset and natural resource shared between countries. The spectrum is being filled but the environmental and public health impact of this occupation has not been properly assessed and rules have not been imposed, despite the warnings made by many studies. The urgency of expanding technical applications and their rapid commercialisation by monopolies in the sector is taking precedence over safeguarding public health, which may have disastrous consequences for citizens and the environment.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Union has a crucial role in European environmental policy. By signing Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, entering into the Rotterdam Convention, the EU has set itself the goal of incentivising and increasing information exchange about the chemicals traded between the parties to the convention and also to implement the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure. The measure ensures that exporting countries of chemicals formally obtain consent from the importing countries before the export can take place. Mr Jørgensen’s proposal aims to limit the derogations usually adopted against the PIC procedure, thereby trying to defend the original meaning of the Convention. The joint intervention of the Commission and the designated national authorities will also be of significant help. This synergy will undoubtedly result in more accurate and reliable documentation on the possible impact on human health or the environment of using dangerous chemical substances in the importing country or another exporting country.</p>

This provides that chemicals originating in the European Union and in compliance with all legal European public health and environmental standards should not be prohibited from the world market, or replaced by chemicals subject to lower standards. Thus, the European Union can now export not only its chemicals, but also its legal standards.</p>

The PIC procedure applies to chemicals, including pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons. When exporting these chemicals to third countries, the EU should take great care to ensure that this is not done against these countries’ will.

At the same time, this will further promote the European Union’s high public health and environmental standards, thereby preventing products from being replaced by some complying with lower standards in the abovementioned areas.

By adopting a recast of the regulation today, the European Union goes beyond the Rotterdam Convention in the sense that the regulation includes more chemicals than the ones listed in the Rotterdam Convention.

The regulation is applied to all chemicals exported to other parties to the convention or other countries, except where there is a conflict between the relevant provisions and any specific requirement of the parties or countries in question, along with compliance with the regulation’s provisions on classifying, packaging and labelling dangerous chemicals.

This means cutting the red tape that stifles development and seeking cost-effective solutions. In one of the worst recessions for generations, the chemicals industry has still driven more than GBP 1 billion into capital expenditure and spent more than GBP 5 billion on research and development, accounting for a third of the overall UK investment.

The regulation makes it possible to export substances that are not banned – but which do, however, need to be authorised by the destination country – to countries that have not responded within the agreed deadline if there is proof that they have been in use in the destination country for at least five years. Indeed, despite the Commission’s efforts, around 30% of past requests have not received a response, which de facto prevents trade in non-prohibited chemicals.

I welcome the rapporteur’s suggestion to oppose allowing exporters to trade the listed products when they have not received a response within 60 days from the importing countries because this would create an exception that would be potentially harmful to the health and to the environment of those countries with weaker administrations.

I support European Chemicals Agency involvement in applying the regulation so as to take on greater responsibility as regards the implementation thereof. The chemicals listed in items 2 and 3 of Annex I to the PIC Regulation are banned or severely restricted in the EU because they are often harmful to the environment and/or human health.

      <p sl="sk">The aim of the Rotterdam Convention, which is being implemented in the EU, is to promote information exchange about chemicals being traded between parties to the convention, and also to implement the prior informed consent procedure when a party to the convention exports chemicals subject to the convention to another party to the convention. It was important to change the rules of prior informed consent in order to make it easier for exporters of chemicals to export in cases where no response is forthcoming. The Commission argues that if a country does not respond to an export request, it might be because the authorities in that country do not feel the need to respond to requests regarding chemicals that are not listed in the Rotterdam Convention, but only in EU legislation. It might also be the case, however, that the country has a very weak administration and is therefore not capable of responding in time. In such cases, it seems very problematic, in my view, to allow the export of dangerous chemicals to these countries. If their administration is not able to react to an export request, it is not likely that the same administration is able to protect the citizens or the environment from dangerous chemicals. The EU is a leader when it comes to environmental legislation, and it should remain so. I firmly believe that it is the responsibility of the EU to ensure that the chemicals we export do not cause unnecessary harm to human health or the environment.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals because Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (PIC Regulation) implements the Rotterdam Convention in the European Union. The aim of the Rotterdam Convention is to promote information exchange about chemicals being traded between the parties to the convention and also to implement the prior informed consent (PIC) procedure when a party to the convention exports chemicals subject to the convention to another party to the convention. This is a mechanism that ensures that countries exporting chemicals formally obtain consent from the importing countries before the export can take place. This procedure applies to the chemicals listed in Annex III to the Rotterdam Convention, which covers pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted by parties to the convention for health or environmental reasons and which have been notified by parties to the convention for inclusion in the PIC procedure. With Regulation (EC) No 689/2008, the EU goes beyond the Rotterdam Convention in the sense that the regulation includes more chemicals than the ones listed in the Rotterdam Convention. Furthermore, the regulation applies the PIC procedure to all countries that import the listed chemicals from the EU and not just countries that are parties to the convention.</p>

      <p sl="ro">A degree of caution is required when it comes to the commercial transfer of chemicals between countries as they pose risks to the population as well as the environment. However, all the Commission’s proposal for amending the PIC (prior informed consent) Regulation is going to do is give producers of chemicals banned or restricted by the EU the opportunity to sell their products in countries which have clear-cut legislation on these transactions. We cannot allow it and I disagree that the ignorance of the governments of all the countries facing this situation should endanger people’s health. The only point I welcome in this proposal is the clarification of the definitions in the regulation and the involvement of the ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) in enforcing it. However, I think that it is absolutely imperative to restrict the departures from the PIC procedure allowed by the Commission, so as to fulfil the European Union’s duty to help create partnerships that are fair and beneficial to all the parties and states involved.</p>

Failure to respond to an export request could be due to a number of factors, such as a weak administration, economic frailty or the belief that the case is covered by the general law. Lack of response cannot, therefore, be taken as acceptance of imports of these chemicals. The EU’s role should not be that of facilitating the export of banned chemicals from European territory to third countries with weaker chemicals legislation or administrations.

The regulation even goes beyond the convention itself because it covers a greater number of chemicals and applies the informed consent procedure to all countries that import from the EU, including third countries. The Commission proposes to increase the possible derogations from the prior informed consent procedure for third countries, thereby allowing – under certain conditions – a substance to be exported even if consent has not been received. However, some of these substances can be truly harmful to health and the environment. I therefore think it is too dangerous to use the Commission’s proposal in this case and declare my support for the report by Mr Jørgensen, who has made clear his disapproval.

Point a) was suggested in response to complaints from EU traders concerned that they could not proceed with exports due to lack of prior informed consent (PIC), even when this lack of PIC was allegedly due to the administrative incapacity/unwillingness of the importing country to react, even though the substances were often not banned/restricted in the importing country.

The implementation of Article 290 of the TFEU was the subject of a non-binding common understanding between the EU institutions. The common understanding concerning Article 291 of the TFEU provided for the adoption of a regulation laying down ‘in advance the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers’. The report proposes changes to the comitology rules. The new Rule 87a, in combination with the new Rule 88, lays down the standard procedure to be followed. The rapporteur proposes a procedure setting out more clearly the rules for cases requiring rapid approval or implementation of a delegated act; that is positive. Another positive element of this proposal is the possibility that a political group – or 40 Members – can contest the competent committee’s decision.

      <p sl="sk">The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty brought about a radical change in the comitology procedure. The revision of the Rules of Procedure entailed by the changes stemming from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty also enables us to meet a request from the President of the European Parliament for a procedure which sets out more clearly the arrangements for the rapid approval of a delegated act or implementing act. The new Rule 87a, in combination with the new Rule 88, lays down the procedure to be followed in the majority of cases – i.e. the procedure for the committee responsible without the associated committees or committees jointly responsible. In the case of Rule 87a (delegated acts), it was necessary to define the procedure whereby Parliament declares, prior to the expiry of the deadline set in the basic legislative act, that it does not intend to raise objections to the delegated act, as provided for in item 11 of the common understanding, particularly in order to enhance the legal certainty of any such decision. In the case of Rule 88 (implementing acts), in the event that the new provisions will apply immediately in respect of legislative acts adopted after the entry into force of the new Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, during the period needed to bring the existing legislation into line, a number of legislative acts will continue to be covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny pursuant to Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

      <p sl="pt">This report is intended to adapt the Rules of Procedure to the new system introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon for exercising implementing powers, which is currently based on approving delegated acts and implementing acts, pursuant to Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. More specifically, it concerns the need, already identified by the President of the European Parliament, to provide for a procedure setting out more clearly the arrangements for rapidly approving a delegated act or implementing act, whether there is just one committee responsible, or whether this is taking place in the context of associated committees or joint committee meetings. In the latter case, this also adapts the Rules of Procedure to the provisions of the recent Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers.

      <p sl="en">In favour. As regards delegated acts, the new rules provide for changes in the procedures to be followed and deadlines to be met by the committees involved (including in cases where Rules 50 and 51 applied for the adoption of the legislative act) and/or by the groups when tabling motions for resolutions to object to delegated acts, revoke a delegation of powers (the two possibilities laid down in Article 290 TFEU) or on the contrary, and in exceptional cases (notably in cases of urgency), give rapid approval prior to the deadlines. As regards implementing acts, the new rules need to take into account transitional provisions governing revision of the existing basic acts based on Articles 3, 4 or 5 of the old Comitology Decision. This means that during the time needed to bring the existing legislation in line, a number of legislative acts will continue to be covered by the old procedure. For the Greens/EFA, this ensures proper procedures within Parliament so that both all the committees involved and the groups can effectively exercise the new rights for Parliament deriving from the Lisbon Treaty.</p>

      <p sl="en">The rapporteur argues that regulatory measures with scrutiny should become delegated acts when the existing legislation is adapted. It seems more appropriate to retain terminology which makes a clear distinction between implementing acts under Article 291 TFEU and measures which, for a transitional period, are still covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. Specific provisions govern procedures with associated committees or joint committee meetings (Rule 88a): the incorporation of the new Rule 88a reflects the need to take account of cases in which the basic act was adopted under the procedure provided for in Rule 50 or 51 of the Rules of Procedure. This new rule, which lays down the procedure to be followed in such cases, thus supplements the provisions of the preceding rules.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon radically changed the comitology procedure, turning it into a new system for adopting delegated acts and implementing acts; see Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The implementation of Article 290 TFEU was the subject of a non-binding common understanding between the institutions. The common understanding concerning Article 291 TFEU provided for the adoption of a regulation laying down ‘in advance the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers’. The Casini report proposes changes to the comitology rules. The new Rule 87a, in combination with the new Rule 88, lays down the standard procedure to be followed. The rapporteur proposes a procedure setting out more clearly the rules for cases requiring rapid approval or implementation of a delegated act. This proposal’s most positive element is the possibility that a group – or 40 Members – can contest the decision of the committee responsible. What is contradictory about this process is that Parliament is gaining this power rather than the European Council and the national parliaments, which have the power to control their governments’ actions.</p>

As well as this increased mobility, the data belonging to each of us know ever fewer borders. The Internet, and social media in particular, have put our personal, professional and social data a click away. This situation represents the ease with which social media can invade many people’s privacy without them leaving their desks, but can also make the public more vulnerable. In fact, defamation cases are increasingly common internationally and it is essential to specify what legislation is applicable. This report includes recommendations to the Commission on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II).

Hitherto, however, Rome II has not applied to cases connected with the protection of privacy and the freedom of opinion. However, increased use of the Internet has given rise to numerous cross-border cases in precisely that area. Rome II does not, in essence, mean any harmonisation of the substantive law.

This is necessary in order to prevent so-called ‘libel tourism’ that occurs at present, in which the aggrieved party chooses to initiate legal proceedings in the country in which s/he is most likely to obtain a favourable result (in the form of greater compensation, for instance), and thereby place publishers in an unfair position. Another recommendation contained in the report for solving the abovementioned problematic situation is to create a separate institution for the resolution of disputes arising from such cross-border violations of privacy and rights relating to personality (including defamation) – an extra-judicial dispute resolution centre that would, in addition to preventing libel tourism, help protect the publisher’s rights on a par with those of the aggrieved party.</p>

It is particularly concerned with infringements of personality rights by means of content placed online on a website. In this sense, the person who considers his or her rights to have been infringed has the option of bringing an action for liability, in respect of all the damage caused, either before the courts of the Member State in which the publisher of that content is established, or before the courts of the Member State in which the centre of his or her interests is based. The intention is, in this way, to add to the Rome II Regulation a provision governing the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report because I am in favour of the recommendations on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, as set forth in the Rome II Regulation. The basic principle will, therefore, be rounded off by a foreseeability clause. In a democratic society such as ours, the right to a private life is a fundamental and sacrosanct right. When personal freedom is violated, it must be possible to take legal action. The goal is to ensure both freedom of expression and the right to privacy in a way that maintains a balance between these two priorities.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In the past, few people had the opportunity to use the traditional media as a means of expression. Today, technological development and the resultant boom in Internet use have given rise to new ways of infringing personality rights. Statements verging on, and often overstepping, the limits of freedom of expression have multiplied in the electronic media. Defamations have become an international issue. Unfortunately, when the regulation concerning non-contractual obligations (Rome II) was adopted, the protection of personality rights was excluded from its scope. I believe that in order to ensure transparency and predictability, conflict of law norms pertaining to delict law should be consolidated. Although Member States have the right to establish the balance between the various fundamental rights at their own discretion, it is high time that in the interest of legal certainty, we make it clear, at Community level as well, what laws are applicable to liabilities for damages arising from privacy and personality rights’ infringements.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the recommendations to the Commission on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II). I think that legal remedies must be available when people’s freedom is abused, particularly when it is detrimental to their privacy and reputation. Every Member State must ensure that these remedies are available and effective in the event of infringement of these rights. The Rome II Regulation lacks a provision for determining the law applicable to violations of privacy and rights relating to personality. Therefore, we call on the Commission to submit a proposal designed to add to the Rome II Regulation a provision for determining the law applicable to non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation. In order to promote the public benefit gained from reducing the amount of litigation, improving access to justice, ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and striking an appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the right to privacy, the Commission should propose the creation of a centre for the amicable settlement of cross-border disputes arising out of the violation of the right to privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation, by means of alternative dispute resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report proposes an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 864/2007, seeking to clarify what legislation is applicable to cases of breaches of rights relating to personality – the inalienable and non-transmissible right of all individuals to control the use of, inter alia , their body, name, image and privacy – through online content or printed material, where the person who believes his or her rights have been infringed has the option of bringing an action for liability. This need is justified by the ease with which a claimant can currently elect to bring an action for defamation in the jurisdiction considered most likely to produce a favourable result, known as ‘libel tourism’. This amendment sets out clearer rules, for example, that in the case of a judicial complaint, the applicable law shall be the law of the country in which the most significant element of the loss or damage occurred, and, in the case of printed matter, shall be determined by sales or audience size. The report’s content could help to clarify legal proceedings in these cases while safeguarding each Member State’s own laws at the same time.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report. I am convinced that the Commission’s trade initiatives need to be supported by a stronger presence of EU trade officials on the ground. I also deplore the fact that the EU Delegation has only one trade official in Tunisia and has no presence whatsoever in Jordan, despite conducting scoping exercises for deep and comprehensive free trade agreements with those countries. The EU must fully coordinate its trade, investment and financing support activities in the region in order to ensure maximum positive impact. It is a concern that the significant number of actors, both internally within the EU and in the partner countries themselves, as well as other external actors, could lead to crucial efforts being wasted or duplicated through a lack of coordination. I will conclude by saying that, without closer coordination between the European Neighbourhood Policy financing instruments, such as the Neighbourhood Investment Facility, and the different EU and international and regional financial institutions in the region, including the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, we will be unable to guarantee maximum effectiveness and coherence.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for this resolution because it states that the Arab Spring has offered the EU the opportunity to match its commercial and foreign policy interests with its core value of human rights. The Lisbon Treaty defines international trade as one of the three arms of the EU’s external action and requires coherence between foreign affairs and international development policies. It is in the highest interests of the European Union to adopt a strategy that is flexible, mutually beneficial, and based on support for democratic transition. In addition, I believe that the call for the reconsideration of the public external debt of the countries in North Africa and the Middle East to be of fundamental importance. That debt was built by the dictatorial regimes, mostly through the personal enrichment of the political elite and the purchasing of arms, which were often used to oppress their own populations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Since the Arab Spring, the European Union has strived to promote stability and democracy in neighbouring Mediterranean countries. To support them in their transition, we believe it is important to increase trade by focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As pointed out by the rapporteur, Niccolò Rinaldi, this trade strategy could enable job creation and help to dismantle oligarchies. It is imperative that our cooperation includes financial support for SMEs through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. We must also promote cultural and educational exchanges within the framework of the Euromed Erasmus and Da Vinci programmes. In this way, we can share our democratic values by creating a real Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The Arab Spring has provided an opportunity to develop more active economic cooperation between the EU and the countries of the Mediterranean region. I entirely agree with the need to adopt a mutually beneficial, responsible and flexible cooperation strategy based on democratic principles. It is very important for the EU to use this opportunity to draw up mutually beneficial trade agreements on goods and services, thus encouraging the liberation process in the economic and trade landscape as well as the consolidation of democratic reforms in the countries of the Mediterranean region. I also welcome the proposal to strengthen the EU’s role as an investor in the countries of the Mediterranean region. To achieve this objective, the EIB should be given a broader mandate to provide further investments for small and medium-sized enterprises in European and Mediterranean countries. It is very important to dismantle existing tariff barriers in goods and agricultural products and expand the scope of trade agreements, etc. Visa facilitation would be one of the most important incentives for trade and cooperation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This report supports the Commission’s policy of taking a liberal approach. Deep and comprehensive free trade agreements (DCFTAs) entail the dismantling of tariff barriers and opening of markets and may weaken these emerging economies. Social, environmental, educational and cultural issues are not addressed sufficiently, contrary to the aspirations of the people. Furthermore, DCFTAs are the result of a long process with strict criteria, particularly the obligation to align with European internal market regulations. In addition, these numerous requirements are not related to the prospect of integration into the European Union, as may have been the case for the countries of Eastern Europe. Do we need reminding of the EU’s failure in relation to the Mediterranean? These agreements focus on bilateral relations, failing to provide support for the regional integration of these countries. Instead, such agreements pit these countries against each other for the honour of being ‘champions’ who meet their criteria. At a time when Europeans are considering the possibility of European protectionism, we are demanding the opposite from our Southern partners. Is that really consistent? Is it fair? I do not believe so and that is why I am voting against this report, despite the fact that it does have some positive aspects.</p>

      <p sl="it">Despite some good parts, overall, I do not share the rapporteur’s outlook and have voted against the report. Specifically, I find some assessments of the Arab Spring to be too optimistic and I do not agree with the proposal on visa facilitation based on the pretext of facilitating mobility for businesspeople.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because the only key to permanent stability, security and economic development and progress in Europe is by developing good relations with neighbouring countries, in order to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness, founded on the values of the Union. The Lisbon Treaty defines international trade as one of the three arms of the EU’s external action and requires coherence with its other policies: foreign affairs and international development. Although trade has always been a strong pillar in the neighbourhood policy, there is a perception that the European Union should be more proactive in aiding political and economic transformations in neighbouring countries. The economic and political reconstruction of the countries of North Africa in the aftermath of the Arab Spring is not being overseen by regional institutions – no specific Euro-Mediterranean financial institution exists. Furthermore, the economies of Southern Mediterranean countries (SMCs) have thus far been run by undemocratic leaders to the benefit of the few, often overlooking the needs of the most vulnerable. The European Union has exclusive competence over trade and investment policy, which allows it to provide an effective response to the upheavals and to contribute to economic and social progress in SMCs. It is therefore very important for the European Union to aim high regarding economic cooperation and to adopt a strategy that is mutually beneficial, responsible and flexible, based on support for democratic transition and the defence of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am voting in favour of the report, while underlining its strategic and structured nature and the careful articulation of the areas of policy action for the existing instruments. Moving from a frank analysis of the mistakes that have prevented effective stabilisation initiatives in this area, in favour of bilateral and regional tactics and policies, the report acknowledges the need to create a free trade area, which will act as an expression of the EU’s external policy action. It also highlights the need to involve the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (with an extended mandate) to promote deep and comprehensive free trade agreements, to support the creation of legal systems and legal, administrative, financial and civil frameworks that will contribute to the establishment of a business-friendly environment and to bolstering the middle class – an essential part of the equation for developing proper, stable models of democracy. Furthermore, the report courageously tackles the delicate issue of the dubious link between free economies and civil rights through the ‘more for more’ doctrine, which will ensure a more targeted aid policy that is based on regular, careful monitoring of results.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted against this report as I do not believe it is the prerogative of the EU to act as a mediator in international affairs and set terms for democratic transitions and trade deals, etc. As part of the international community, Britain as a sovereign country and member of NATO and the UN has opportunity to cast its opinion in such matters. However, the EU is a democratically bankrupt supranational organisation that I believe is on the cusp of witnessing its own revolutionary spring as elections across Europe demonstrate growing distaste for austerity-led policies to protect the single currency. It is thus laughable that the EU should demand support for the transition to democracy in the Arab Spring countries when it has shown little willingness over the past few decades to host open and fair referenda and tackle the democratic deficit of its own triumvirate system.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it tries to make a real contribution to relations between the EU and all the Mediterranean countries in the light of the changed conditions following the Arab Spring revolutions. On the one hand, the proposal urges the EU to act with increasing diligence to incentivise international trade together with all EU businesses looking to invest outside the EU, thereby contributing to the establishment of a free and inclusive Euro-Mediterranean market. On the other hand, the text looks at those countries that have begun their journey towards democracy since the Arab Spring to try and ensure that these people understand that economic development is possible and that it is the first step towards the prospect of a better life. My support for this initiative is due, lastly, to the fact that I consider this not only a commercial strategy for its own sake, but the start of a series of initiatives that the EU and the countries of the Southern Mediterranean must be capable of pursuing and coordinating with increasing vigour, skill and effectiveness with regard to democracy, development and the well-being of all citizens involved.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Arab Spring has raised huge expectations for democratic and economic growth for Southern Mediterranean countries. These two phenomena must go hand-in-hand, generating a virtuous cycle from which Europe can also benefit. The EU is therefore duty-bound to take this opportunity to promote the development of the affected countries. Economic and democratic growth in the EU’s neighbouring countries is beneficial not only to these countries, but also to all the Member States. By establishing trade relations with such countries, European businesses – and especially Italian businesses, for obvious geographical reasons – will have a chance to recover from the current economic situation, while problems related to migration would also be alleviated. Bearing this in mind, the role of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is essential, since it is responsible for promoting the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in the area. Moreover, we also need to promote integration in the area so as to develop internal trade there, which is currently very limited. I therefore voted in favour of this report on the EU trade and investment strategy for the Southern Mediterranean.</p>

At the same time, I would like to highlight that some EU Member States have not yet ratified the amendments to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Agreement.

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the vote on this resolution on the EU’s commercial strategy for Southern Mediterranean countries. The text is very balanced and constitutes a good, in-depth analysis of the current situation following the Arab Spring. It offers, I think, some good medium- and long-term prospects. Beyond a simple commercial strategy, this is about developing trade with our neighbours and guiding them so as to provide support for the democratic transition of these countries. It is vital that we play a role at this level so that their populations see a significant improvement in their rights and living conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why it nonetheless seemed important to me to draw the attention of the Committee on International Trade (INTA) to certain issues, for example, the greater involvement of civil society in future partnerships. It would also be sensible for the European Central Bank to give stronger support to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Southern Mediterranean countries. SMEs should be at the heart of growth in these countries. In conclusion, I will finish on a point which, to me, seems fundamental: mobility and student exchanges between both shores of the Mediterranean.

      <p sl="hu">Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Arab Spring can be considered the most significant political transformation in Europe’s neighbourhood.

The perception amongst the civil societies of the Southern Mediterranean countries is that the EU should be more proactive in aiding political and economic transformation in the region. Since the 2008 economic crisis directly affected the main sectors that represent the economic drivers of the Southern Mediterranean countries, and since the turmoil experienced by Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and Libya during the Arab Spring has further compounded the economic downturn in those countries, I find it necessary to strengthen relations in terms of the creation of investment opportunities. This strategy must be implemented in full cooperation with the other policy areas. Through the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), the European Investment Bank (EIB) plays an important role in supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Southern Mediterranean. These enterprises need essential investment to allow them to innovate and restructure in a manner that would enable them to tap the potential of the EU’s internal market.

I very much welcome the introduction of the ‘more for more’ principle, since it can represent a very effective tool to enable tailor-made and bottom-up strategies, which are fundamental for tackling the different economic and societal demands of the different Southern Mediterranean countries (SMCs), while also ensuring that funding schemes, shaped according to the political and economic ambitions of SMCs, are sufficiently effective.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The so-called Arab Spring was a ‘breath of fresh air’ sweeping through the countries of the Southern Mediterranean. Imbued with a longing for freedom and social justice, civil society drove a revolution that toppled a number of totalitarian regimes. However, in some countries, we are starting to witness smatterings of religious intolerance from the Islamic majority, in breach of the rights, freedoms and safeguards enshrined in the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is intolerable that we are witnessing the Islamic majorities negatively discriminating against Christians when they used to live side-by-side. This report concerns the EU trade and investment strategy for the Southern Mediterranean following the Arab Spring revolutions. Although negotiations with Morocco have not progressed as much as is desirable, the fact is that a memorandum for the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) was agreed with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean in December 2011, which was aimed at their integration with the single market. The EU should continue supporting these countries, particularly with regard to implementing the democratic process and to fostering entrepreneurship and student mobility. However, it should also demand absolute respect for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of this report is to tackle the challenges to EU trade and investment policy following the democratic movements in the Middle East and North Africa.

The report highlights the social, economic and democratic weakness of the various countries, but explains at the same time that ‘the EU is the biggest consumer market in the world, to which access should only be granted if partner countries are serious about engaging in the bilateral opening of markets’. It argues that deep and comprehensive free trade agreements are the right path towards these regions’ social and economic development. The entire report is inspired by a neoliberal vision and an apology for free trade. Obviously, we voted against.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Arab Spring is the greatest political transformation in the European neighbourhood since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and has offered the EU the opportunity to match its commercial and foreign policy interests with its core values of human rights, democracy and a free society. The EU has exclusive competence over trade and investment policy, which allows it to provide an effective response to the upheavals, and to contribute to economic and social progress in Southern Mediterranean countries. I consider it essential for the EU to coordinate its support for trade, investment and financing fully in the region, in order to ensure maximum positive impact. Given the significant number of internal actors within the EU, such as the various Directorates-General of the Commission, the Members States and the European Investment Bank, and the external actors such as the partner countries themselves, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, the African Development Bank and even the G8, it is extremely important to ensure synergy between the measures in order to avoid a ‘doubling up’ of activities. The Arab Spring is a challenge for the EU and for a more determined effort at trade liberalisation and the creation of investment opportunities. This strategy should be conducted in full cooperation with other policy areas with the aim of creating training opportunities for business people, promoting participation in EU programmes and facilitating visa access.</p>

      <p sl="it">There can be no denying that the events of last spring have profoundly changed the outlook of all countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean: they have escaped from regimes that had been in power for several decades and often dominated by a charismatic leader. We should therefore look favourably on a change that brings greater democracy and participation, while being wary about how the various situations are dealt with. Pretty much everywhere, where more or less ‘free’ elections have been organised, the Islamic fundamentalist parties have done very well, influencing the political and social climate as a result. Therefore, it looks a bit risky to me to embark this early on such important initiatives with these countries, which still do not offer the necessary guarantees, especially in terms of social and economic stability. Europe was wrong to behave in an almost servile way with the previous leaders, but I do not want Europe to make another mistake by launching itself enthusiastically into new relationships, especially where trade is concerned, which I would not want us to regret quite quickly.

The more important objectives of trade dialogues with these countries should include economic diversification and the stimulation of employment for young people and women, the reduction of corruption, and transparency.

That said, it looks as if the future will see greater room for manoeuvre towards a sound political integration and trade policy with the Arab Spring countries, building around the ‘more for more’ principle, whereby the parties commit to work for a bilateral opening of their markets, to the benefit of citizens and the social and economic reforms undertaken in these countries.</p>

Some of this report’s proposals concern the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The former is key to helping small and medium-sized enterprises, through granting micro-credit.

The Arab Spring countries do not share the desire of the former Eastern bloc to become EU members, but they do demand political and economic reforms which the EU and the EBRD can help them with. While it is important that this Parliament and the Council of Ministers ratify the amendments to the EBRD agreement so that the bank can become fully operational in the region and increase the funding available for EBRD investment, one should not sideline the long-term request of the countries bordering the north and south for a Mediterranean Investment Bank which would be owned and managed by them.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the EU trade and investment strategy for the Southern Mediterranean following the Arab Spring revolutions. A successful commercial strategy for the region must strengthen the role of SMEs, which provide as much as 30% of employment in some countries. Greater efforts need to be made to reduce the high number of unregistered SMEs operating in the ‘black market’. Certain studies put the percentage of informal employment (excluding agriculture) in certain Southern Mediterranean countries at 70%. I regret that SMEs and cooperatives have limited access to investment, and I insist on the need to provide proper access to funding through the reliable, accessible and user-friendly provision of micro-credit and counter-guarantee schemes by the European Investment Bank (EIB). In this regard, I welcome the recent extension of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s mandate. Visa facilitation is still a problem for many representatives of SMEs in Southern Mediterranean countries who intend to visit EU institutions for meetings, training courses or other business reasons.

      <p sl="fr">Parliament today voted for a report on the EU trade and investment strategy for the Southern Mediterranean. This is yet another European Union report which still fails to learn any lessons from the citizens’ demands during what has come to be called the Arab Spring. In this report, relations between both sides of the Mediterranean remain mainly economic relations based on free trade. Niccolò Rinaldi (rapporteur of this liberal text) even dares to say that ‘Trade (…) facilitates a more equitable distribution of wealth’. He goes on to add that some Mediterranean countries ‘inherit large quantities of assets and natural resources’. Do we still need to ask ourselves who in fact exploits them? The EU is more anxious to protect the interests of its major companies than it is to see the wealth of these countries benefit the populations who brought about the revolution, first and foremost for social reasons. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance managed to include in this report the need to reconsider what is considered to be an odious debt. I therefore could not vote in favour of a report which is profoundly at odds with my view of international relations.</p>

The rapporteur argues that, following the popular revolutions, these countries will now move towards democratic ideas. However, it should be remembered that the nature of the previous regimes did not inconvenience the EU until then and nor did their governments, with which they established deep relationships. It should be recalled that Ben-Ali’s party was a member of the Socialist International until he was overthrown by the Tunisian people’s struggle. Following the European Commission’s lead, the report advocates the ‘more for more’ concept; that is, democratic reforms and individual freedoms should be reflected in a so-called ‘liberation’ process in the economic and trade landscape, by consolidating the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade Area. It also advocates the use of the notorious free trade agreements, which have, to date, demonstrated that they only lead to peoples losing sovereignty, multinationals appropriating natural resources and biodiversity, increased dependence for third countries, and disaster for some Member States’ productive sectors, particularly in those with more fragile economies, like Portugal.</p>

The issue of patentability is a sensitive one as it underlines, on the one hand, the need for greater protection for European innovation and, on the other, the need to support European businesses by promoting research. Furthermore, we must set clear limits in line with our ethical principles: we cannot authorise patents on living matter. That is why, in this vote, Parliament opposed by a substantial majority the possibility of patenting plants and animals bred through conventional selection procedures. This vote endorses our determination to combat the appropriation of living matter.

Around 800 patent applications are submitted every year, adding up to thousands in a few years. Although there are rules on patenting, we need greater legal certainty in this regard. Clearly, patents need to be protected, since registration thereof defends inventors, encourages research and stimulates the economy. However, not all genetic manipulation should be allowed. It should not be possible to patent natural products, such as plants and animals, and only crossing by traditional methods should be allowed. It is the future of the planet that is at stake.

The threat of world agro-genetic resources being concentrated in the hands of a limited number of seed and agro-chemical companies entails disastrous consequences for our farmers and also, further afield, for those in developing countries.

It would have allowed time to reach a genuine political balance between the rights of plant breeders and the rights of those who hold patents on innovative breeding processes such as smart breeding. The approved resolution presents the debate as a settled matter and a mere clarification of current practice. This is not the case. I am committed to defend the breeders’ exemption principle under the Plant Variety Rights Directive. However, this cannot be a full blown exemption infringing the rights of the original right holder. A distinction must be made between free access to conventional breeding material for research and respect of the patent holder’s right through licensing when new varieties are commercialised and still contain the patented trait. This resolution literally removes all incentives for smart breeding developments and risks hampering innovation in an area where Europe is a frontrunner.</p>

Moreover, no arrest or blocking of a ship, even as a measure of investigation, shall be ordered by any authorities other than those of the flag state. This is a core principle of international maritime law, but it is flouted all too often. The same applies in the case of the two Italian marines, who are still being held unjustly in Indian jails even though they were assisting a ship sailing under Italian colours that was in international waters. We urge India, once again, to comply with these standards.</p>

      <p sl="el">The group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted against the joint motion for a resolution by the conservative, liberal and social democrat groups on ‘maritime piracy’ because it is being used as a pretext for stepping up imperialist interventions by the EU, the US and NATO from the Horn of Africa to the Indian Ocean, in order to control the wealth-producing resources and exploit the people. The motion calls on the EU to strengthen its military and maritime presence in the area as a whole by boosting the EU NAVFOR Atalanta force in coordination with NATO. It also proposes increasing the presence of armed guards on ships and promoting new Euro-army and Euro-fleet staffs in the area. Intervention by land is being legalised and the break-up of Somalia is being promoted. It calls for the militarisation of the European Maritime Safety Agency and other bodies, in order to support maritime war operations by the EU and NATO, thereby increasing the risk to seafarers and citizens. The people urgently need to step up their fight to dismantle the EU and NATO and other imperialist unions, in order to win power for the people in their countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support this resolution because piracy continues to spread in the Indian Ocean, particularly off the coasts of Somalia. In that country, one of the causes of piracy is political instability. Indeed, I believe that an effective approach to countering maritime piracy must include a broader strategy to lift Somalia and the whole region of the Horn of Africa out of poverty and state failure. For this reason, I am particularly concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the region. The international community should increase its provision of aid assistance and prevent any further worsening of the situation. In addition, third countries and those EU Member States that have not yet done so must transpose into their national law all the provisions laid down by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation.</p>

However, this appeal should not let us forget that we must address the root causes of this problem, which are poverty in the Horn of Africa and the shortcomings in Somalia.</p>

Maritime piracy poses a threat to international security and regional stability and the EU must contribute to international maritime security and fighting piracy. I very much welcome Operation Atalanta’s contribution to maritime security off the coast of Somalia by protecting World Food Programme chartered vessels delivering aid to Somalia, as well as the decision by the Foreign Affairs Council to launch the EUCAP Nestor project, which will aim to strengthen maritime and judicial capabilities and the training of a coastal police force and judges in eight countries in the Horn of Africa and the western Indian Ocean. I believe that training is a particularly important part of maritime capacity building. The Commission’s additional EUR 100 million in EU financial support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) is very important. I welcome calls for Member States to begin to promote peace and economic development and to build a stable democratic regime in Somalia.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Nowadays, 80-90% of global trade is carried out by sea. The annual cost of piracy to the global economy ranges between USD 7 and 12 billion, with the profits gained by the pirates in 2011 amounting to an estimated USD 238 million. Pirate attacks in the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean have risen from 20 in 2006 to 219 in 2011, while the area covered by the pirates has expanded now to 1 300 nautical miles from the Somali coast. The Gulf of Aden is one of the key maritime routes along which approximately 12% of the world’s oil is transported. Somali territorial waters and the adjacent coast are largely ungoverned, which allows piracy to flourish with impunity and affect the global maritime sector. This combination of illegal activity and lawlessness provides fertile ground for high levels of instability, organised crime and other transnational threats.</p>

      <p sl="it">Authors including W. Bernstein and Niall Ferguson have explained that major international trade is once again being organised along shipping routes, which means that piracy should be seen as a direct threat to the heart of our societies, on a par with terrorism. According to the Centre for Strategic &amp; International Studies, piracy costs the global economy from USD 7-12 billion each year, with profits from trading in hostages alone thought to be around USD 250 million. A threat like this, which challenges the international rule of law and global stability, which latches onto and prospers parasitically from regions suffering failed governance and the infiltration of terrorist or criminal organisations, requires a firm and measured response, as called for by this joint resolution, which has my utmost support. The framework for international cooperation requires urgent reinforcement as the violent acts of these criminal bands are being met with isolated responses by sovereign states and private operators. A lack of legal and organisational coordination in this area threatens to nullify the considerable efforts and investments made in fighting piracy and risks, compounding the number of crises caused by differing interpretations of operating protocols and the pillars of international law, such as the crisis involving the two Italian marines who are still being held in India.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On Thursday, 10 May, I voted in favour of the resolution on maritime piracy. While the subject is no longer in the news, it has not gone away. Quite to the contrary, in 2011, the Indian Ocean and, in particular, the coasts of Somalia, have fallen prey to a resurgence in acts of piracy. Although Parliament has prioritised the fight against piracy, since 2008, piracy has remained a lucrative trade, generating USD 12 billion per year. Piracy trade is fuelled by ransom money and the misappropriation of international aid and we must put an end to it as soon as possible. It also represents a threat to regional stability and maritime transport. This resolution reaffirms our determination to improve maritime safety and the coordination of military resources in this region which is victim to institutional failure. We have therefore decided to extend the mandate of the Atalanta programme for two years. Furthermore, it would be counter-productive to neglect the social dimension of our action in this region known as the ‘Horn of hunger’, given that this criminal behaviour is, in part, a symptom of poverty and violence.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe it is utterly inappropriate for the EU as a supranational European organisation to be policing the coast off Africa. Piracy is a major problem and impacts around the world. Recent high profile cases involving British tourists have brought the issue under the media spotlight, and it is of the utmost importance that the international community cooperate to prevent this damaging illegal industry that was responsible for 15 deaths last year alone. Yet it is not just policing that will combat the threat of piracy. The international community also needs to examine the root causes of the proliferation of this criminality. The EU has contributed to the increasing incidence of piracy in East African seas by over-fishing African waters under unjust trade deals. EU trawlers indiscriminately dredge oceans around the world for fish, leaving native communities, many of which are under-mechanised and wholly dependent upon fishing for self-sufficiency, unable to harvest the sort of catch they need to earn a decent living. The international community should look into the foreign exploitation of East African waters as a primary cause of the increase of piracy. The reason the EU wishes to police East African coasts is to protect their own commercial interests.</p>

This operation was launched on the initiative of President Sarkozy in 2008 and shows the utility of facing such wide-ranging challenges on external territory together. It has been a real success and, moreover, we can congratulate ourselves on having developed a genuine European strategy for the Horn of Africa.

      <p sl="fr">The situation in Somalia, both in terms of food and security, makes it one of the countries in the world with the harshest living conditions for its people. Acts of piracy have proliferated in recent years in this important global maritime route, due in part to these circumstances. The Council recently extended the mandate and the scope of the European Atalanta mission. I do not think that there can be a military solution to the crisis in Somalia or to the piracy in the waters around the Horn of Africa and Somalia. I therefore join with Parliament, through this resolution, and call on the Council and the Commission to review their political strategy on Somalia and to put an end to the EU NAVFOR Atalanta mission, as this cannot be judged a success given the increasing number of attacks. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to support instead the efforts deployed by the United Nations to promote the reconciliation process between both parties in the civil war in Somalia. We must also guarantee access to humanitarian aid for the affected areas, with our priority being to improve the population’s humanitarian situation.</p>

More goods are transported by sea than by any other means on the planet. In recent years, however, we have witnessed a phenomenon that recalls the Age of Discoveries in the 16th and 17th centuries: piracy. For centuries, piracy was one of the main risks of travelling by sea, and it still represents danger and uncertainty for many of the vessels that ply the oceans. We are all aware of the recent piracy phenomena across Somalia. The European Union has been taking measures and participating in actions intended to prevent this phenomenon that we could term maritime terrorism. I voted for this report since, as well as recommending that the Member States protect their fleets, it seeks to attack the problem at its source; that is, in the pirates’ home ports.

It obscures the fact that a number of European countries, the US and NATO are responsible for the serious problems facing the peoples of Somalia and other regional countries, and that these problems are at the root of the so-called piracy. We are well aware of the interest aroused by the region. It is rich in natural resources – particularly fisheries – and important for international trade, with the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden linking the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean, which is the fastest route between Asia and Europe. The solution to the region’s problems involves respecting Somalia’s sovereignty over its resources and its exclusive economic area, the immediate withdrawal of the EU and NATO mission, and an immediate break with the so-called structural adjustment policies of the IMF and the World Bank, which, since the 1990s, have led to the collapse of the country’s fragile economy, jeopardising its food sovereignty and security.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Maritime transport has been one of the key stepping stones to economic growth and prosperity in Europe throughout its history. More than 80% of world trade is carried by sea. Piracy, however, threatens international security and regional stability, and the fight against piracy and its main causes is therefore a priority for the EU. Piracy on the high seas has still not been solved. It is becoming an increasing threat both to human life and to the safety of seafarers and other persons, as well as to regional development and stability, the marine environment, world trade, all forms of maritime transport and shipping, including fishing vessels, and also to the delivery of humanitarian aid. Pirates are constantly adapting their tactics and methods, and have expanded their operational radius through the use of larger hijacked ships. In my opinion, it would be justified to make an attempt at a more formal coordination of a comprehensive strategy against piracy among the various interested parties in the EU. Alternatively, it might be appropriate to set up an official operational group under the aegis of the European External Action Service, for example, which would bring together all participating bodies. The EU could promote this concept of an action group within the UN Security Council, with a view to creating a global action group that would work in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation.</p>

Only by ensuring the enforcement of the rule of law, sound administrative management and improved welfare in this country will we root out piracy – both at sea and within the country itself. Today, the EU is the largest donor of aid to Somalia – EUR 415 million is allocated in development aid. In addition, tens of millions are also allocated to humanitarian aid alone. All this money is for creating jobs and developing infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. The EU also supports the creation of security forces.

No vessel appears immune to it, from fishing boats and merchant vessels to yachts and cruise ships. People’s safety and freedom are seriously imperilled, and all maritime and economic activities are suffering significant losses. In 2009, the Commission organised an intervention at two levels: prevention, deterrence and repression, as well as combating the causes of piracy. The Commission must extend its military action beyond 2012 and intensify its diplomatic action to obtain effective collaboration from the third countries that shelter the pirates.

      <p sl="en">I supported the resolution on maritime piracy which requires a coordinated response. The fight against piracy will not be won solely by military means but through promotion of peace, development and state-building. I welcome the decision to extend the EU’s counter-piracy operation for two years to protect vessels of the World Food Programme. I welcome the commitment of an additional EUR 175 million through the European Development Fund (EDF) to provide lasting solutions to the root causes of piracy, namely poverty and state failure, and to support development projects for sustainable economic growth. We must liberate those currently being held hostage by pirates and secure the release of the seven hijacked vessels. We need enhanced coordination between the EU and other international actors to achieve a comprehensive approach to fight piracy. We need more effective measures to punish those suspected of acts of piracy. EU Member States need to put into national law all the provisions laid down by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigations. Member States need to investigate and confiscate money which is paid as ransom to pirates in order to identify and dismantle organised crime networks.</p>

      <p sl="fr">There is no doubt that this draft resolution on maritime piracy strengthens the EU’s Integrated Maritime Policy (IMP). Indeed, maritime transport has been a key vehicle for European economic growth, and not just growth in Europe, as more than three quarters of world trade is carried by sea. The European Union therefore has a genuine interest in ensuring that security is a factor in the common maritime policy. Over recent years, we have seen in the news a resurgence of criminal acts at sea. We find the greatest number of acts of maritime piracy in targeted areas, often concentrated in the Red Sea, and through which large numbers of European and international transport and trading vessels pass. Most of these acts remain unpunished. That is why this motion for a resolution is essential because it calls again for immediate and effective measures against impunity of this nature and calls for the need for strategic coordination between the European Union and third countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">The resolution we have debated this morning has been signed by almost all political groups, showing that this issue has been tackled across the political spectrum. The text reminds us that there are currently around 200 sailors being held hostage by pirates, who continue to hijack ships carrying humanitarian aid, as well as merchant and fishing ships, in order to get a ransom. The attacks mostly take place off the coast of Somalia and in the western Indian Ocean, as also shown by the United Nations forces currently stationed there. Through this resolution, we are appealing loud and clear for the EU High Representative to obtain the liberation of the hostages and the ships and to support the establishment of an anti-piracy court. The fight against piracy can only be won if the Union tackles the root causes of this phenomenon: extreme poverty and the failure of the State in this area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on maritime piracy. Maritime transport has been one of the key factors contributing to economic growth and prosperity in Europe throughout its history, and more than 80% of world trade is carried out by sea. Unfortunately, piracy poses a threat to international security and regional stability. This is why the EU has a genuine interest in contributing to international maritime security and the fight against piracy and its deep-rooted causes. Since 10 000 European ships pass through dangerous maritime areas every year, piracy poses not only a problem to human life and safety, but also an economic problem, as it jeopardises the international commercial maritime routes, entailing a considerable adverse impact on global trade. We call for immediate and effective measures to prosecute and punish those suspected of acts of maritime piracy. We urge third countries and EU Member States which have not yet done so to transpose into their national legislation all the provisions set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the UN Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation.</p>

      <p sl="en">We all agree that there should be a free and safe circulation in national and international maritime routes, a premise that is not being respected by piracy in different parts of the world. As a democrat, I welcome the EU’s efforts to combat piracy and I am especially satisfied because we are taking steps forward to solve the main cause of this situation: piracy exists because there is poverty in many countries. That is why the EU authorities have increased the provision of humanitarian assistance to people in need in these countries, in order to provide the local population with alternative livelihoods through which they can properly sustain themselves. For all these reasons, I will support this joint motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted against the joint motion for a resolution on maritime piracy as I believe that it does not take account of the socio-economic factors which account for this state of affairs and that the international action which has been put in place is not the right response. Military intervention is not a solution and the European Development Fund (EDF) should not therefore be used for this purpose. If we follow this argument, the EU NAVFOR Atalanta operation must be considered a failure. In my view, there can be no improvement in the situation without an improvement in the living conditions of the population, who are caught in the stranglehold of civil war and ecological and economic disasters. European economic interests should not drive decision making. Piracy is the result of poverty and the absence of a cooperation policy worthy of that name which could do something about it. What the southern countries need is for the rich countries to completely reverse their international policies. Until things change, extreme poverty, famine and conflict will remain the southern countries’ daily lot.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the adoption of this resolution, which reminds us that we need to fight against sea pirates primarily for the obvious reason of protecting human life. We cannot in good conscience deliver our ship owners and sailors to their fate. They work on a daily basis to develop trade and global growth. Nor can we abandon local populations, who make a living from fishing and can no longer go out to sea. Clearly, as far as both local communities and the international community are concerned, it is imperative for us to mobilise all our legal and military resources to combat pirates, who are using increasingly heavy weapons and who stop boats increasingly far from the coast. This, in any case, is the wish that Parliament has clearly expressed and which I emphasised when drawing up this text. I now hope that Baroness Ashton will urge the States to increase military resources for Atalanta and to apply the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea fully, in order to put an end to the unacceptable impunity of pirates.</p>

      <p sl="en">I have voted in favour of the resolution on Maritime Piracy (2011/2962(RSP)) in an effort to continue the protection of all seafaring vessels and the men and women that work at sea. I strongly believe that this resolution can implement the appropriate measures to insure safer waters as well as hamper, if not stop, the actions of the so called pirates. Many of our Member States rely heavily on shipping, be it for imports or exports, or employment, either as a ship’s crew or, the vastly important fishing industry. Therefore, we must demonstrate our willingness to do what is necessary to protect against this horrific practice. It is important that we continue, and even increase, our participation with the current actions being taken by the UN, NATO, the US and others. It can be said that we as a democratic Union will not lay down to the terrorists of the seas as it infringes upon the ideas which are greatly valued by us. The protection of our citizens and those of our allies is of the utmost importance and cannot, and will not, be undermined by these perpetrators.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In 2010, Somali pirates collected a total of about USD 238 million in ransom money and, to achieve this, attacked over 4 500 ships. Over the past years, their actions have created significant difficulties for trade, especially for oil and its derivatives. The cost of marine insurance has also increased and shipowners have passed this on to their customers. What is worse, the attacks are covering a greater area year on year. Pirates have been active off the coast of India and they have carried out attacks in the Bay of Bengal and in Indonesian waters. This issue demands that decisive military as well as aid measures be taken. As far as the first is concerned, the European Union should not become actively involved in military action, but instead ensure that more experienced organisations, especially NATO, have more scope for action. The alliance has always been a strong supporter of Europe’s military interests and this should continue. Our efforts should be focused on allocating funds to rebuild Somalia, which has fallen into chaos, as well as on consolidating the stocks of fish that fishermen from the Horn of Africa used to catch.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This resolution supports prolonging and strengthening the mandate of EU NAVFOR Atalanta and increasing coordination with the NATO operation, but it obscures the causes of the serious problems facing the peoples of Somalia and other regional countries and the responsibility of the EU, the US and NATO for these problems. The majority in the European Parliament are reiterating militarist and interventionist positions, so as to promote the domination of big capital and the major EU powers over the region’s natural wealth – particularly fisheries – and over one of the most important regions for international trade, with the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden linking the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean, which is the fastest route between Asia and Europe. We defend Somalia’s sovereignty, including over its exclusive economic zone, and we advocate a peaceful political solution free from international interference to its civil war. We advocate the immediate withdrawal of the EU and NATO mission, of which Portugal is also part. We defend the right of peoples to their food sovereignty and security, and reject so-called trade liberalisation within the framework of the World Trade Organisation, other instruments like economic partnership agreements, and the structural adjustment policies imposed by the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
