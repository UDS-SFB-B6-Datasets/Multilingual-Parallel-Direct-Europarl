      <p sl="sl">Mr President, first of all, may I say that, during the sitting this morning, we will see real evidence of the work of our Committee on Culture, Education and Young People. I am rapporteur for a dossier, a very important report on Youth on the Move, which is based on a communication from the European Commission. At this point, I would like to thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to prepare this report and I would also like to thank the European Commission, which has prepared this report and which has included the problems faced by young people amongst the fundamental priorities of the EU’s 10-year development plan.</p>
      <p sl="sl">When drawing up this report, I worked with many stakeholders, especially representatives of young people, both from Member States and the rest of Europe, for example, with the European Youth Forum. We have had quite a few meetings and conferences. I also worked with the Committee on the Regions and the Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, so the report is a product of many exchanges of opinion during the period of its preparation. I would also point out that, at the time when this report was being adopted, my fellow Members from other political groups showed quite a constructive stance. In that respect, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, in particular, who have done a good job and, as a result, we have before us today the report in its present form.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to point out that, according to various studies, young people who avail themselves of the opportunity to study or work abroad perform better in school, they are more successful and more competitive in terms of job hunting, and, moreover, in terms of their integration into society. However, politics alone cannot guarantee good schools, good education or good jobs for young people. What it can do, though, is create favourable conditions to help young people achieve these things. Those conditions are most certainly linked to the modernisation of school education systems. Europe, and Member States in particular, are facing the major challenge of improving, during this decade, vocational education and training, for example, and making it more attractive and improving its quality. The European economy very much needs vocational qualifications in the next decade. By as early as 2020, I estimate that as many as 50% of all jobs will require education and training of this kind. Therefore, vocational education and training remains one of the priorities of our policy, as well as of the policies of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sl">However, continuing the reform of the Bologna Process is even more important. European universities should be even more in touch with the economy and society at large. European universities will become more competitive when they pay even greater attention to the needs of the market, the economy, and when they also manage to find additional sources of funding. It is a fact that, in Europe, we have too little funding for higher education. The European countries, Member States of the European Union, are underinvesting in students, and this is quite a big problem.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Obviously, as part of this priority, the European Union has also set other targets which must be achieved: to reduce the dropout rate, which, at 16%, is unreasonably high, so we need to reduce it to 10%. Similarly, we will need a more highly-educated labour force in this decade if Europe is to retain its competitive edge over other parts of the world.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Since my time is up, I will take two more minutes later, after the debate, to provide further information.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016-000" speaker_id="5846" name="Mary HONEYBALL" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="United Kingdom" birth_date="12-11-1952" birth_place="Weymouth" p_group="Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament" m_state="GB">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very pleased indeed to have the opportunity to present my report on early years learning in the European Union, which is an extremely important aspect of education that we have not really given much attention to before now.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Vassiliou and her cabinet with whom we have worked very closely on this, and also the Hungarian Presidency, which had early years learning as one of its priorities. This has been a very fruitful partnership all round and has allowed us to do the work reflected in this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to thank all the shadows from the other political groups. We have worked extremely well, as Mr Zver said, on his report, and we adopted the early years learning report in committee unanimously, which just goes to show that there is support across the political spectrum for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know why really: one of the main reasons is that early years are so important. Early years intervention can make all the difference to children’s life chances, not only as they go through the educational system, but also later on in life. The research which has been done, most of which I am afraid is not within the EU, shows that, if you give children support and what they need when they are young, it helps them in later life: it cuts down on crime, improves health and cuts down on unemployment, therefore benefiting all of us.</p>
      <p sl="en">The children themselves will, in most instances, achieve better at school, they will get better grades, they will have high employment levels and better employment and their family relationships will be better – as will their health. So we have everything to do on this and it is all beneficial.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within the EU, there are a variety of types of provision for early years and in my report, we have said that we want to respect and maintain that. Each Member State does it differently, because early years has grown up within their own systems. It is made even more complicated by the fact that the age when school children start statutory education also varies from Member State to Member State. So we have not been looking at a ‘one size fits all’ solution, but we have looked to establish values and principles and guidelines for Member States to develop a European framework of shared goals and shared values and shared entitlements.</p>
      <p sl="en">So that is what this report is about: it is actually about setting the framework. In order to do that, we have, of course, started with the child. We have advocated a very child-centred approach to early years education and care, with the best interests of the child at the heart of this. We have drawn on research from around the world, and my report looks at the following issues: engagement with parents, which is very important for early years for young children; staff and the quality of services and qualifications required; and integrating early years services with the rest of the education systems in Member States. So we have covered these key areas, and these are what we should be focusing on in future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Staff qualifications are extremely important and they are very lacking in this area. There seems to be a view that anyone can look after little children, while that is actually not the case. We need to think hard about qualifications, and qualifications which can be transferred and recognised across the EU. We also need to look at access, so that all of those who need early years education services can get hold of them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have finished my four minutes and I want to keep some time for the end of this debate, so I would just like to end by saying that in this time of austerity and times of economic difficulties, we must make sure that early years is still on the agenda and we still do what needs to be done in this important area.</p>

    <intervention id="4-017-000" speaker_id="96945" name="Marietje SCHAAKE" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Netherlands" birth_date="28-10-1978" birth_place="Leiden" p_group="Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe" m_state="NL">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, before highlighting a few elements of this elaborate report on the role of culture in the EU’s external actions, I want to sincerely thank my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education for their constructive collaboration and for unanimously adopting our joint work in the committee vote. Of course, civil society and other stakeholders have also provided very helpful input.</p>
      <p sl="en">Culture has intrinsic value in our liberal democracies. It enriches peoples’ lives. The EU is well known for its cultural diversity and, at the same time, it is a community of values which apply equally to each citizen. These European values, such as respect for human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms, are also represented by our cultural products. Cultural identity, values and the EU’s position on the global stage are intertwined. European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership, both through cultural programmes and when cultural aspects form an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies. Through the sharing of literature, film, music and heritage, doors of understanding are opened and bridges between people are built.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU also has important experiences to share when it comes to overcoming conflict and building stability through shared interests and mutual understanding. In the development of the External Action Service it is important to mainstream and streamline the role culture has, and should have, in the EU’s external actions. It should be a vital and horizontally integrated element among the broad spectrum of external policies which make up the EU’s foreign policy, from trade relations to its enlargement and neighbourhood policy, and its development cooperation and common foreign and security policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Culture also has economic value. Europe’s cultural industries contribute to European entrepreneurship, innovation and business, and the EU’s diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive tourist destination in the world. Knowledge and international skills are crucial to education and employment, as indicated in the EU 2020 strategy, but culture can also be considered as a vehicle which helps to foster democratisation, freedom of expression, inclusion, development, education, reconciliation and much else.</p>
      <p sl="en">This very wide variety of aspects of cultural relations vis-à-vis third countries has led to a fragmentation of policies, which needs to change to a more coordinated and coherent EU strategy. We have chosen to emphasise the organisational and policy frameworks that are needed for the optimal coordination of culture in the EU’s external actions. The filling in of such content should not be governed and regulated to too great an extent ‘from the top down’.</p>
      <p sl="en">European citizens are best able to benefit if the EU acts as a global player on the world stage. This requires funds to be used more efficiently, and we have to be aware of Europe’s competitive position and the struggle to attract tourists, talent, artists, business and students. We must speak with one voice and be aware of the competition from cultural programmes by China and the United States, to name just two. But there is no need to reinvent the wheel. The EU has a number of best practices from the Member States, as well as from different cultural institutions such as the Alliance française and the British Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another aspect that is very prominent in our 21st century is the ever-larger role played by the new technologies, both in culture and in international relations. People depend increasingly on the Internet for access to information and can only express themselves freely when this information, and their communications, are not censored. The right to cultural development and other fundamental rights is increasingly facilitated by these technologies. Access to cultural content happens through new media as well, and the opportunities for global connectivity around European cultural goods and content should be celebrated and facilitated, for example, through Europeana or websites of museums and festivals. It is important that the EU develop a strategy for Internet freedom. I will come back to some of the concrete recommendations of this report in the last part of my intervention.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from Mrs Schaake, I would like to begin with a few words about the important report that she has drawn up. The cultural dimension of the EU’s external policy cannot be overestimated. We therefore need – as she has already said – a coherent EU strategy for culture within EU external policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cultural diplomacy has an important role to play when it comes to building successful relations with third countries and, in many countries, there is a network of national institutes for culture, EUNIC, that we can make use of. There are many, many people who have linked in to the network and stand ready to help.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am now pleased to turn to today’s second subject, which has also already been addressed by Mr Zver, namely, the subject of Youth on the Move, which, of course, is a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy. This flagship initiative is designed to encourage actors in the field of training and education to give more attention to these policy areas. We need better-qualified people. We need people who have experienced Europe thanks to improved mobility opportunities. We need to unlock the potential of our young people with the aid of our successful programmes. All of this has a major role to play in the competitiveness of a knowledge-based society.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to lifelong learning, our existing Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo and Grundtvig programmes have given many people wonderful opportunities to discover Europe in its diversity, gain experience for themselves and improve their language skills. Moreover, in this context, the significance of the Youth in Action programme and of the European Voluntary Service should not be underestimated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today’s debate must also send a signal to the Commission that we must continue these popularly well-received programmes and opportunities in the next generation of education and youth programmes, too, and that they must be well funded in keeping with their significance. Every euro that we spend in this area repays the whole of society not that many years later.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will now turn to another subject, namely Sarajevo. Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture. By naming the city a European Capital of Culture in 2014, we could send an important signal for the multi-ethnic character of the city and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which could also give the political class in that country cause to rethink their ideas. What is more, this is a city that makes it abundantly clear how badly Europe failed and how important it is to act together. There would be significant symbolism in such a step, as Sarajevo was the scene of the assassination that brought about the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. That is the reason for the date of 2014 – one hundred years after that historic event.</p>
      <p sl="de">During the Bosnian war, between 1992 and 1996, Sarajevo suffered the longest siege of a capital city in modern warfare history. Allow me to remind you of one day in Sarajevo, 28 May 1992. The cellist, Vedran Smajovic, clad in black, was playing Tomaso Albinoni’s Adagio. His stage was the ruins of the devastated national library in Sarajevo; his audience consisted of a small group of people who had remained, despite the siege of the city, and who were listening to his music. For 22 days, he played in various locations in the ruins of Sarajevo. It was a requiem for the people who had been killed in those dark days. I was moved, and I was full of admiration for the brave and heartening behaviour of the cellist and his audience. What these people expressed through their behaviour, in the face of the horror and the loss, connected me forever with the city of Sarajevo.</p>
      <p sl="de">The cultural life of the city has never stopped. The winter festival took place even under the most adverse of circumstances. People of all nationalities head there each year. Every year, there is a winter festival, a kids’ festival and a film festival. From Korea to Australia, Bulgaria to Sweden, film makers head to Sarajevo; co-productions take place. The city has retained an intercultural character, to which it tends – even as the political surroundings harden more and more into ethnic trenches. For that alone, this city deserves the chance to demonstrate its immense intercultural potential.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sarajevo wants to apply for this title in connection with a derogation, and has already undertaken extensive preparations. We all know well that, if we adopt our proposal today, we will be asking for a derogation from the decision of the European Parliament and the Council. However, if this House were to demonstrate its backing for the candidacy of Sarajevo today, I would put my trust in the judiciousness and far-sightedness of the Council, as our arguments are actually irrefutable. Particularly at this point, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the city of Sarajevo need a sign that all is not lost and that Europe also supports their efforts.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019-000" speaker_id="96746" name="Marie-Thérèse SANCHEZ-SCHMID" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="France" birth_date="15-11-1957" birth_place="Perpignan" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="FR">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our debate this morning, the issue is not simply about an economic model or a legal system. We are talking here about culture and civilisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What place does Europe want to give to culture? What influence do we want for our works and our creation? The digital revolution, linked to globalisation and growing trade, compels us to rethink our cultural and economic model. With the Internet and digital media, what do we want Europe to be moving towards? Politics is the art of anticipating, preparing what we would like so that we do not have to put up with what we do not want.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The American film maker James Cameron spent on his film ‘Avatar’ the equivalent of the European Union’s ‘culture’ programme for the 2007-2013 period. Will we be the consumers of cultural products that do not belong to us anymore, dependent on multinational oligopolies such as Google, iTunes, Amazon or Hollywood, without being able to defend our assets?</p>
      <p sl="fr">This morning, we are thinking about the challenges faced by culture in the globalised world of the 21st century. The European Commission, with the publication of its Green Paper last year, has at last taken stock of the potential of our creative and cultural industries. The European Union has a cultural heritage and cultural assets, as well as an extremely dynamic and lively film industry. The MEDIA programme is celebrating 20 years at the Cannes Festival this year and is supporting 20 of the competing films as well as festivals, performing arts and large exhibitions, which are taking place throughout the year and across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, despite the recession, the sector of creative and cultural industries has been consistently making progress in the last decade. The figures speak for themselves. In 2003, this sector generated a turnover of EUR 654 billion. It contributed 2.6% of Community GDP and accounted for 3.1% of all jobs within the European Union, or 5.8 million people. In 2008, it already represented EUR 860 billion, 14 million jobs and nearly 7% of GDP. That is more than the automotive industry and the agri-food industry put together.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The dual nature of these industries, which are, at the same time, economic and cultural, makes them important levers for sustainable, intelligent and inclusive growth for Europe – in short, the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. As well as being economic assets, they sustain and enrich cultural diversity. They contribute to social cohesion, to making regions attractive and to the European Union’s influence in the world. It is time to give impetus, at Community level, to a real momentum that would unlock their potential and stimulate their development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, I wanted to explore many lines of action to support the growth of these industries. These measures have several strands. Firstly, putting education and training at the heart of our strategy. On the one hand, Europe must encourage creative talents from a very young age, raise young people’s awareness of culture, and develop partnerships between universities and companies. On the other hand, it should enable those in the culture sector to be trained with regard to new technologies, entrepreneurship, and should stimulate the exchange of best practices and the transmission of know-how. Secondly, it is essential that we adapt copyright to the digital era. Indeed, the current procedure for acquiring copyright is too fragmented, too complicated.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third vital component of our strategy should be the protection of creativeness. Intellectual property is a precious asset. Creativeness that is undermined is creativeness that is doomed to disappear. Creators’ mobility must be encouraged. The European Union must work to introduce a European status so that they can enjoy fair working conditions and social protection. It must facilitate the purchase, distribution and circulation of works, adapt taxation, for instance, with reduced VAT for cultural goods, and lastly, help with funding. Private investors are too often reluctant when it comes to funding SMEs. The opportunities offered by public funding, particularly the Structural Funds, are not fully exploited. Creativity and culture must be considered as crucial aspects in our policy and, in this respect, Europe owes it to itself to promote them.</p>

    <intervention id="4-020-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Androulla Vassiliou" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, of course, you understand that I will take a bit longer than five minutes to reply to the five reports.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank Mr Zver for his report on Youth on the Move. We really appreciate his efforts, as well as those of his co-rapporteurs, in dealing with this very important topic. As the report makes clear, the key objective of Youth on the Move is to help young people in Europe to gain the skills and experience they need to succeed in today’s increasingly internationalised knowledge-based economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our goal is very much to create an environment in which every young person will be able to realise their potential. This is why the Commission has launched actions to support Member States in improving the quality and relevance of education and training from early childhood through to higher education. This is why we have set out measures to strengthen further the mobility opportunities available to young people and it is why my Commission colleague László Andor and I have placed so much emphasis on improving conditions for young people moving into the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="en">To achieve this, as Mr Zver’s report makes so clear, sustained investment in education and training at all levels is necessary and, of course, Europe must play its part. That is why I am arguing so strongly for increased resources for the new generation of education, training and youth programmes for the period after 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to take this opportunity to respond directly to two points in the report. Firstly, I would like to reassure you on our approach to improving the transparency of higher education systems. As the report argues, our ultimate goal is to improve the information available to prospective students and others on various aspects of institutions’ activities and performance. We want to develop a tool to overcome the shortcomings of existing university rankings by including a wider range of factors. We have no intention of publishing league tables of universities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, in the light of the call in the report for steps to remove barriers to mobility, I would highlight the fact that a Council recommendation designed to encourage Member States to do precisely this is due to be adopted by the Council in the coming days. It will mark a further step in our ambition to extend mobility opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion on Youth on the Move, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the honourable Members once again for their support.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the subject of early years learning, I would like to thank Ms Honeyball for her report and for the constructive approach she has taken to the issue of early childhood education and care. Education and care for young children, which are widely accessible, inclusive and of high quality, help first of all to reconcile family and working life. Secondly, they are the foundation for lifelong learning, social integration, personal development and employability later in life. Investing early is much more effective than intervening later.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission therefore very much appreciates Parliament’s approach, focusing on the long-term benefit of investing in early years learning. The Commission shares the view expressed by Parliament that a more child-centred approach is needed. Besides the number of places available, we must also address the question of quality at European and national level. I am thinking, for example, of staffing and staff quality, the integration of care and education, and active engagement with parents, who are the first educators of their children. The Commission welcomes the call for more European research in the field and for more efficient use of the existing financial tools, such as the structural funds and the lifelong learning programmes. We also welcome the strong emphasis on the need to identify and exchange good practices at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to the Schaake report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, I congratulate Ms Schaake for this excellent own-initiative document. It rightly underlines the role of culture not only as a bridge between peoples but also as a fundamental element in promoting our values in the world. At the same time, it calls for a more strategic approach to cultural cooperation between the EU and third countries. The report also makes interesting suggestions on how the European External Action Service could take up the challenge of developing truly European cultural diplomacy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this regard, Ms Schaake, I would mention two particular points in your report. Firstly, let me underline the relevance of your recommendation on a coherent and comprehensive strategy for cultural diplomacy at the level of the EU institutions. Secondly, let me refer to the idea of providing the European External Action Service with a real cultural diplomacy dimension. One of the aspects of this effort would be the establishment of cultural attachés in major capitals around the globe. The creation of such postings would allow increased coordination both between the present cultural attachés of Member States’ embassies and between those national institutes of culture with a local presence, particularly via the European Union National Institutes for Culture (EUNICs) network. I had the pleasure of meeting EUNICs in both China and Brazil recently and I heard from them how much they need cooperation and coordination in order to promote our culture in the countries where they serve.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards our emerging strategic partners around the globe, we have witnessed recently how culture can become an integral part of our external relations. I am more committed than ever to advancing further this very important dimension of our European agenda for culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now come to the Sanchez-Schmid report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries. I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Ms Sanchez-Schmid, for this very good report. I am pleased to see that there is a strong convergence of views between your report and our analysis. We agree that the cultural and creative industries are a powerful motor not only for jobs, growth and export earnings, but also for social inclusion and cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as intercultural dialogue within the European Union and beyond. As you rightly say in the report, these industries have a vital contribution to make to the Europe 2020 strategy and must be given a more prominent place in the EU for the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also share the view that their potential is not fully developed. If we want these industries to develop fully, we have to make progress on various fronts: skills adaptation and capacity building, access to funding, improving the business environment, support for cross-border circulation and new distribution models, maximising these industries’ potential for regional and local development, promoting their spillover effects in terms of innovation, and promoting a creative Europe on the world stage. This conclusion also emerges from the consultation launched by our Green Paper, which prompted reactions from 350 public authorities, the general public, civil society bodies and companies active in the field of culture across Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to see that our Green Paper has sparked, in Europe and within the European institutions, a very rich debate on the right environment to put in place to meet the specific needs of creating entrepreneurship in order to seize the new opportunities offered by globalisation, digitisation and cultural diversity. I am firmly convinced that our joint efforts will help to create a better environment in which these vital industries can play an important role in the discussions on EU funding mechanisms post-2013 and implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I am very happy to see Parliament’s enthusiasm – and, in particular, that of my good friend Doris Pack – for the European capitals of culture and Sarajevo’s interest in holding the title. The Commission, of course, shares your view of the historic and cultural importance of Sarajevo. The city symbolises some of the darkest episodes in recent European history but also carries our hopes for a better future. In the face of repeated conflicts, Sarajevo has retained its multicultural spirit.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say a few words about the rules governing the European capitals of culture. In 2006, Parliament and the Council adopted the decision on which the initiative is based. This legal text lays down all the rules concerning the selection of the cities, and you know better than I do that a decision of this nature can be changed only through a new initiative following the ordinary legislative procedure. The decision states that the initiative is open exclusively to the 27 Member States of the European Union. As an integral part of the decision, a chronological list indicates, for every year until 2019, the two Member States which are entitled to hold the title. Two cities have already been selected for 2014, and the Council is about to confirm the two cities for 2015.</p>
      <p sl="en">The decision lays down the procedure for awarding the European capital of culture title, and the rules leave no scope for the Council to designate a city outside these procedures. The Commission is fully and solely responsible for implementing the decisions adopted by Parliament and Council. A derogation from the decision on the European capitals of culture in relation to a matter as fundamental as its geographical scope would simply break the rules that we have been asked to follow.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe it would be particularly difficult to justify an exception so soon after we have all agreed the rules of the initiative. Parliament and the Council adopted the current decision less than five years ago. That was the moment, surely, to make the case for the participation of non-Member States or to make provisions for exceptional cases. However, at that point, it was decided that the participation of non-Member States would not continue beyond 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking to the future of the European capitals of culture, the Commission is currently working on renewal of the initiative beyond 2019. We launched a public consultation and are conducting an evaluation of the current scheme. We will then prepare a proposal, which we expect to adopt at the beginning of 2012. As part of our preparatory work, the Commission is exploring the idea of candidate countries joining the initiative after 2019. I would also inform you that a number of cities in other third countries have already shown an interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me to finish by underlining once again how much I appreciate Sarajevo’s place in European history and its cultural significance. While the capitals of culture action is not available, the EU can offer other types of support for Sarajevo, in 2014 and beyond, through our cultural programme.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have abandoned my prepared text because I have to say something about the proposal to have EU cultural attachés. I could not believe I was hearing it: I have to say that this proposal from the Commission is one of the most bizarre and ludicrous ever to come out of a body which is celebrated for its bizarre and ludicrous proposals.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU cultural attachés will simply mean more highly paid non-jobs for favoured EU civil servants paid for by the contributing countries.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, let us get back on topic. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to thank everyone who worked on this report. In the committee, all the groups pursued the unanimous objective of making education and training possible for every young person in Europe and supporting their entry into a career, while no young person should fall by the wayside.</p>
      <p sl="de">I did not base my opinion for the committee on the Commission report, as I found it too unspecific. It was important to me for very specific tasks, too, to be listed in the report. In some cases, I was unable to support the positions taken in the report.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, one important aspect is the transition from school to career. It is a core interface. This transition must take place without time spent waiting around. We also found it important that young people’s entry into their careers should not be associated with social dumping and that it must not take place under conditions of dumping. We felt that the role of traineeships was important. They are important and they are necessary, but their abuse must be avoided and forbidden. We would like to see an initiative for a European qualifications framework laying down minimum standards for traineeships.</p>
      <p sl="de">I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme. The work of youth associations is important for social engagement and helps young people progress, both in terms of substance and personally. That is also a major advantage for later working life.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all, I shall deal with the cultural and creative industries. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this report, particular attention is paid to the working conditions in the sector, in particular, irregular income and insecure working relations, which call for an in-depth debate in order to take account of specific aspects, for instance, by fighting against discrimination in terms of remuneration, and to improve the match between job held and level of qualification.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We want to make it easier for young people and the most vulnerable to access culture and creative content, and we want to encourage mobility and promote cultural diversity as well as the use and spread of free software and open standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes. I now turn to the ‘Youth on the Move’ scheme. Things are tough for young Europeans: whether accessing employment, education, accommodation, social services, they undergo what is tantamount to the ordeals of a social initiation ceremony. We need to restore their confidence in the future by providing adapted and ambitious answers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training. In this respect, I should like to stress the request, which I support, put to the European Commission, for a Green Paper on youth participation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our report also highlights the idea of mobility, which should be accessible to all, and I welcome that. Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training. It would be regrettable to categorise young Europeans as either an educated elite, multilingual and confident in the future, or as young people left behind on the grounds that they do not have a Masters degree or because they are only doing manual work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme. I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people’s autonomy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our report insists on the main desire of young people to be autonomous, to have access to healthcare in particular, and to have decent accommodation at a reasonable price. We all know that the young person who has no option but to work as well as study is heading towards failure in his/her studies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I am delighted that, in this House, it has been recognised that work placements should no longer be jobs in disguise, fully-fledged jobs. Work placements must attract sufficient remuneration and social protection.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe all of us are aware that we are facing very turbulent times in Europe, both economically and politically. Our solidarity is being threatened, as nationalist and populist movements are in the ascendant, as demonstrated by one of our British colleagues a moment ago, a member of the nobility, at that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Ladies and gentlemen, the current trends pose a threat to the future of the EU and to the prosperity and well-being of Europeans. We have been elected to provide an answer to that. Commissioner, where necessary, that answer can and must also come from the cultural sector. We must definitely invest a lot more in the creation of a common European public space. Education, as has already been pointed out in this debate, could make a very important, if not crucial, contribution to that end. We firmly believe that we can make much better use of the cooperation between entrepreneurs in the cultural sector, on the one hand, and academia, both higher education – universities and higher education colleges – and secondary education, on the other, and that they offer a lot more opportunities than we are currently utilising.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Commissioner, you have just said it yourself: this is a sector with a major potential for our economy and employment, which is why we must take specific, stimulating measures, such as reducing the tax on online projects, because the current system, certainly the VAT rate, is out of step with the times and is absolutely unfair. Furthermore, entrepreneurs, managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the creative sector, need better access to financing opportunities, because we currently have too little know-how and too little access to bank finance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This report puts forward very specific proposals in that respect and, Commissioner, we are counting on both the Commission and the competent national and regional authorities to pick up the gauntlet and start implementing this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the position of the cultural and creative industry forms part of the European strategy for innovation and the EU 2020 strategy, and is closely connected with measures aimed at the more effective use of monuments, museums and gallery collections, or urban and rural units in tourism and related activities. The digitisation of historical and cultural content represents the main opportunity in this regard. Digitisation should increase the access of the general public to materials that are essential for study, cognition and education, and strengthening cultural identity.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Investment in these areas brings an almost guaranteed return, not only in the area of tourism, which is surely a significant component of many regional economies, but also in foreign policy. It pays to develop awareness of the deep cultural traditions of European countries and, at the same time, to promote individual villages, towns, regions, Member States and the EU itself in a global context.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In the new programming period after 2013, we should therefore continue the funding of cultural projects from the European structural funds, strengthen the twinning programme for cooperation between local authorities and retain the independence of the community programme for projects in this area with the title of ‘Culture’.</p>

We look forward to broad support in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We are at a point in time when digital technology and the Internet are creating both huge opportunities and enormous challenges for Europe’s cultural and creative sectors. We must hold on to the foundation for defending intellectual property and, at the same time, take the necessary steps to be able to release the potential and creativity in modern technology. Europe’s cultural practitioners, technical innovators and, above all, Europe’s citizens deserve a well-functioning internal market, where creative content can flow freely and generously across our borders and where cultural practitioners are secure in the knowledge that they will receive remuneration for their work.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for including the proposal put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs to provide increased access to books for those who are blind or sight-impaired.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), all the rapporteurs who presented reports this morning, as I believe that these reports allow us to lay the foundations for the Europe of the future. This morning, we are working on future generations, from children to our young people, whom we must guide into the world of work by means of the important flagship initiative entitled Youth on the Move. This morning, we are discussing expanding the Union towards the Balkans through culture, as well as developing cultural and creative industries.</p>
      <p sl="it">At a time of great economic crisis, it is important to emphasise that the only sector not making a loss – in fact, its turnover is actually increasing – is the cultural sector. We would like culture to play a part in the external actions of the European Union, and not only, Lord Dartmouth and Mr Kuhn, through well paid officials, but rather by constructing a better process for peace, stability and understanding between different cultures.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, though, we must also seek to strengthen our programmes for culture, education and young people. For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action, and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union’s existence. For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon. We need to invest in all these programmes but, above all, we need to believe in them. Nobody is denying the importance of milk quotas, investment in industry and protecting the environment; but it is culture that will allow us to build Europe, and we will have to do this not with words, but with programmes and actions that we are able and willing to put into practice.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations. This is how Europe will be built, and at times it may even be necessary to bend those regulations a little.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I am delighted that the European Parliament has finally devoted one entire morning of its plenary session to culture and education. Education is one of the key issues in a time of crisis, and we must not forget that educated young people are our future.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I welcome the Commission’s Youth on the Move initiative and the fact that it has not forgotten about young people. Investing in education is the solution to the perennial problems of the EU, even in a time of belt-tightening. I would like to congratulate the European Parliament rapporteur for Youth on the Move, Mr Zver. I think his report is extremely good, particularly as it is the work of an entire committee sharing the common objective of benefiting young people.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The mobility of young people in the EU, and particularly the facilitation of this mobility, is important for European identity and European citizenship activities. As you all know, however, I was very critical of the original Commission initiative, and I would therefore like to emphasise several points which we have managed to include in this report.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is surely important for us not to stop investing in mobility and youth programmes, such as the current Erasmus and Leonardo programmes, and the Youth in Action activities. This is surely one of the ways in which we can achieve the objectives we have set in our Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning and activities that are not just for young people. I would definitely like to emphasise equal opportunities for all, not only in terms of gender equality, but also for disabled or otherwise disadvantaged people. It is surely important to recognise informal education as another very important means for improving skills which young people can use in their future lives.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The dialogue between Member States and between regions is also very important, and I am delighted that we have managed to include a number of comments from the Committee of the Regions as well as other organisations, such as the European Youth Forum, for example.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There are so many of these that I could carry on speaking not just for two minutes but for 10 minutes, but I would like to end with one sentence. I would also be delighted to support – as one of the original authors – the initiative on Sarajevo, as it is very important for us to show the people of this region that the EU is here for them.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I am pleased that this morning’s plenary is devoted to cultural matters: it is very important to speak about them, not just on one morning but more broadly. Nevertheless, it is good that we are dealing with these issues. It is something of a challenge to bundle all these reports together and give evaluations of them, but perhaps I can express a few views on them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Concerning Mr Zver’s Youth on the Move initiative, it is very probably true that this mobility programme has proven to be a success story, and his report, to its credit, goes a lot deeper into the matter. I believe that it could lead to many success stories being documented in European history and on the subject of youth in the future. It is important to ensure that we have Europe-wide educational programmes in which young people can participate, and that multiculturalism can be strengthened as a result.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is also very important to consider what Mrs Honeyball says in her report on early childhood education and care (ECEC). I would prefer to speak of early education and care rather than early years learning, as a person’s growth process is important. People must be allowed to grow, and education is just one part of that process. If we can bring our children and young people up to be good human beings and well-balanced members of society, that is a huge challenge. Obviously, the home has a crucial role here, but, as the report points out so well, it is also vital to ensure that those working in the ECEC field have a role to play and that there is a process of mediation, something which children and young people particularly need today.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Regarding Mrs Schaake’s report on the EU’s external actions, I think that we need a greater understanding of culture when we are laying down foreign policy. That is very important. There are many unfortunate examples of situations where ignorance of cultural backgrounds and the cultural context has led to failures in foreign policy, and that is why it is very important to make culture an integral part of the European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I would like to finish by saying that my opinion regarding the Sarajevo initiative, which Mrs Pack brought up today, is that it is quite true that five years ago decisions were taken on capitals of culture, but, as in science, a paradigm always has to be challenged anew. Now perhaps is the time to do so regarding this particular issue, to some extent at least, and try to find a solution where a change might be made with respect to Sarajevo. I believe that it could produce added value for the European Capital of Culture programme and the European Union as a whole.</p>
      <p sl="fi">To sum up, we should look at the bigger picture regarding cultural policy and try to understand its importance for the whole of the European Union. The internal market and foreign and security policy will not endure if there is no strong cultural base to support them. Culture is the basis of everything, the basis of the future for the European Union as a whole, and that is why it is important to ensure that it is acknowledged, not just in the light of GDP, but as a value in itself, both for people and societies, and, ultimately, for the entire European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in recent years, academic and political focus on culture and education has increased dramatically, with analysis consistently highlighting these areas to be crucial not only in encouraging economic growth and social cohesion, but also in facilitating mobility for young people across Europe. Unfortunately, in the current economic climate, with many Member States adopting austerity measures and budget reductions necessary to reduce deficits, these areas can often appear neglected and I wish this were not the case.</p>
      <p sl="en">Investment in education and culture helps Member States to compete globally, equipping our young people for the challenges of tomorrow, and encourages creativity, innovation and mutual understanding. However, it is precisely in these areas where the Member States, rather than the EU as a whole, can act, and where they know how best to respond to the educational challenges they face. I am concerned with a number of aspects of the reports we have discussed this morning, especially regarding the intrusion on Member States’ subsidiarity in terms of educational targets and social policy. It is beyond the competence of the EU to dictate educational reforms to Member States, and we must ensure that this is respected.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of culture, the EU can assist Member States in getting the best out of their policy priorities through exchanges of best practice and highlighting areas of importance, such as early years learning, the reduction of early school leaving and the promotion of vocational training. Another key to helping our young people secure opportunities is to allow flexibility in labour markets so that people can learn on the job. However, the arbitrary creation of new projects and organisations to facilitate these goals runs counter to the budgetary realities evident across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must be mindful of this sad fact and try to deliver what we can for the real world that we face. Nonetheless, I am a great believer in the power of culture to ensure mutual understanding and to spur innovation and economic growth. We have a wealth of culture and creativity in Europe which needs to be fostered and developed. The creative industries add greatly to the EU’s economy and our cultural experiences. We need to give them the tools to continue their development and gain the rewards they deserve. It goes without saying that, the more we educate our young people across Europe, the more the future begins to look brighter in a challenging global environment.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of the Youth on the Move report, and in view of the various amendments that have been tabled to the reports on the cultural and creative industries and on early years learning, I should like to share the following thought.</p>
      <p sl="es">The economic crisis is being particularly harsh on young people. In many regions of the European Union, youth unemployment is above 40%. This is what makes an in-depth review of policies to get young people into work, such as the Youth on the Move report, so necessary.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will focus on four – in my view – key aspects of the report.</p>
      <p sl="es">Firstly, I believe it is of the utmost importance to promote mobility. It is an extremely valuable means of informal learning that favours cultural exchange and gives young people the tools they need to develop within a global professional environment.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, and in close relation to mobility, it is crucial that young people learn other European languages, for two purposes: to interact fluently in the European environment and to be fully integrated members of the communities where they live and work, or, in other words, for social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, I should like to stress the importance of policies to stimulate entrepreneurship. Indeed, it is essential to foster entrepreneurship programmes for university students. This will involve promoting forums where financial players and students with innovative ideas can interact.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I believe it is vital to promote equal opportunities in access to university so that no fraction of European talent is wasted. We need young people to take an active part in the economy. We need young people to develop their full potential because they, too, have an essential role to play if we are to emerge from the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, with only two minutes to talk about five reports and an oral question, I will restrict myself to two reports: the report by Mrs Sanchez-Schmid on creative industries, and the report by my colleague, Mrs Schaake, on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions. I am doing this because, together, they give us the micro vision and the macro vision of what Europe needs in order to be able to turn this crisis around, with the help of the talent and imagination of Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the case of the creative industries, I believe that it is very clear that Europe has probably the highest concentration of potential for the creative industries. This is true from the outset for our urban areas, our cities, which have, on the one hand, very good connectivity and, on the other, very strong and varied cultural personalities, with a great deal of diversity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Some of our urban macro-regions also have elements that the creative industries need to be sustainable on their own: that is, intensive capital, a concentration of talent and knowledge, and a vast array of already established companies. We can see this, for example, in the region between Paris, London and Antwerp.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, this is not true of the whole of Europe. In other words, in some peripheral regions of Europe, there is talent, there is history, and there are cities that could play a major role in relaunching the European economy, but they cannot get there without aid, whether at Union level or at Member State level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, we cannot delude ourselves about this: until Europe puts its economic house in order, for example, by issuing bonds, nothing can be done. We are here in Parliament with very good ideas and, at the same time, the governments are tearing the euro to shreds and making recovery impossible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards external action policy, and since I am already almost out of time, I should like to say that the European Union has a unique opportunity to develop a completely different type of foreign policy from those of the Member States. Moreover, culturally, this has nothing to do with creating a potential European identity and an illusory European identity, and subsequently exporting it or selling it overseas. Europe could, instead, position itself very well to use culture in external action as a two-way street, whereby we teach but also learn, and whereby we maintain fruitful dialogue with other great regional blocs such as Mercosur or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is how best to benefit the rest of the world with the example of European democracy, but it also benefits the European Union, because we will be able to learn from others.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my contribution by stating the need for a new methodological approach, particularly in the heritage and cultural heritage sector, linked to the intelligent use of new technology. An awareness of the massive potential for improvement that new technologies can offer us, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, necessarily involves abandoning the ways we worked in the past. New technologies mean new working methods.</p>
      <p sl="it">I myself have witnessed that by using technology intelligently in the monument protection sector, it is possible to obtain significant results, in terms of both the planning and restoration works. Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange</p>
      <p sl="it">What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe. I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I will restrict what I have to say to the ‘Youth on the Move’ report.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because the report has managed to cover absolutely every aspect of this issue and this European policy. More specifically, I will restrict my speech to three issues.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Firstly, with regard to points 24 and 25 in the report concerning children staying at school and increasing their attendance at school, I would like to ask the following question. Incidentally, I also submitted a question to the Commission quite recently for a written reply. I am still waiting for this reply, but I am taking this opportunity to mention this problem which I have been raising for a long time. Many of the Eastern European countries from the last enlargement round face the problem that certain minority groups already follow a practice, which has almost turned into a tradition, where they stop their children going to school, who are then exploited by their parents. When measures are taken to change this process, these measures are usually described as discriminatory. This is why I am asking the question: whom are we discriminating against to be more precise? I wonder whether it is the parents, who are exploiting their children, or the children, who are losing, as a result, any opportunity to become integrated because they do not have any education, although, as you know, economic integration through work and resources provides a basis for any other integration.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Regarding point 27 of the report, this point again makes a very precise reference to a real problem. A leading university lecturer recently shared his view with me that, in actual fact, Bulgarian universities are not aware that there is also an Erasmus programme for teachers. Further measures need to be taken in this area.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally, on the subject of youth unemployment, which is mentioned under letters F and G of the report, this is also a significant problem. The problem to which I am referring is that when young people apply for a job, they already need to have had a traineeship. However, when someone has just left school or university, they cannot have already gained such work experience. Such a requirement is ridiculous and discriminatory and must be looked at closely. This is the procedure in both the public and private sectors. For that matter, one measure which can be taken in the public sector in particular is to impose strict rules for people to retire who have reached retirement age so as to free up jobs for young people.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Commissioner, we have to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid for the report. EU institutions have set themselves the goal to take advantage more effectively of existing opportunities that lie within cultural and creative industries. This is an important task, because better industry terms would allow the EU to become a global market leader in this area.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Culture contributes to the fight against poverty and marginalisation, and plays a part in strengthening and preserving the common European spirit and heritage. By creating a clear path for creative thinking and the resulting ideas, we can all gain intellectual and economic advantages. Cultural and creative industries are already important motivators and influencers of the economy, even though their situation is not always favourable. While it is not possible to restrict creativity, it is possible to negatively influence people’s willingness to create. An uncertain entrepreneurial environment and an unfavourable legislative framework can dampen citizens’ creative spirit. We can rightly expect from a European strategy to help creative groups, which have been restricted until now, to express themselves on a European level. At the same time, it may promote a certain degree of opportunity balance amongst Member States, allowing us to experience the presence of an industry with five million workers, as well as the growth of their numbers in every Member State. In this area, we intend to assign an important role to small and medium-sized enterprises as well. Central Europe has a considerable number of bright citizens with a desire to create. The question is whether we can already provide everyone with the proper background today. Unfortunately, the answer is no, but an increasing number of targeted programmes have been set up to improve the situation, including, for instance, the Danube strategy.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This morning’s discussion also concerns youth. It is vital for future generations to receive from Europe full support in the areas of cultural learning, further education and artistic creation. We must find solutions that make artistic creation attractive within the European Union and, at the same time, secure a playing field in international competition.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In summary, it is of vital importance that we concern ourselves with cultural and creative industries, which is why we must create as soon as possible – for artists and creative minds alike – adequate conditions that take into consideration unique characteristics, in the areas of mobility, intellectual property rights and social protection.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through its report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, Parliament clarifies its aspiration to also put our own stamps on this developing policy field. The fact – and I want to put this carefully – that I do not see a representative of the External Action Service here today shows how necessary this report is.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report quite rightly urges that, in future, cultural aspects should play a more significant role in external policy, into which they should be more systematically incorporated. For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU. Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy. The EU’s motto of ‘United in diversity’ should also come to bear on the image that the Union projects to the outside world. We should also make even better use of the new media as a communications platform to that end.</p>
      <p sl="de">As we do all this, we need to make sure that art and culture do not become means to an end in external policy. It is our cultural values that characterise our European Community. It is therefore important and right that this cultural diversity and identity should also be disseminated outside the Union by its policies. I feel sure that we can achieve much more in this way, including in the debate about human rights and democracy, than through many cases of sabre-rattling, sometimes with absolutely nothing to back it up, in this House.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of a fight, which is also reflected in the debate here today – a fight between the forces in Europe that want to weaken the European project and those of us who – in the midst of the crisis that we find ourselves in right now – want us to reef the sails and actually strengthen the European project. A great deal is currently being said about the economy and about integration and foreign policy, and that is clearly important, too. However, there is no doubt in my mind that if we are to preserve the European project and, in particular, if it is to find support among the people of Europe, who are currently sceptical about the whole idea, we need to invest in culture and we need to invest in young people. Therefore, I obviously very much welcome the debate here today and also the five reports that we are discussing.</p>
      <p sl="da">I was shadow rapporteur for the report on Youth on the Move, and I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Zver, for his excellent cooperation. As time will not allow me to go into too much detail, I will just concentrate on two aspects. The first is the question of young people being able to move across borders. I believe that in this time of crisis, it is necessary for us to really focus, both politically and financially, on actually implementing and supporting this mobility for young people. Therefore, I am naturally very pleased that one of the things we are working on is strengthening what we are calling the European Qualifications Framework, in other words, the scheme that allows young people to use the points that they gain across borders. This is a small but tangible detail that it is important to promote so that young people do not experience problems in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="da">Secondly, I would like to highlight what we are referring to as the Mobility Scoreboard, in which we indicate the barriers to mobility in the Member States. This is also something that I strongly support – I think it is a very good idea. These are just two specific examples that show that we are making progress and that the devil is in the detail. In specific terms, this is where we need to work to strengthen the opportunities for young people and, in so doing, invest in our young people. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and to wish the Commissioner luck with the huge task – as I know – of making the other Commissioners in the Commission College aware of the importance of culture and young people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to focus my attention on the cultural dimensions of external actions and the report drafted by Mrs Schaake. I would like to say that in several aspects, the report is worthy of support and congratulations. In paragraph 17, it condemns totalitarian regimes which use censorship. In paragraph 50, it objects to the use of cultural arguments to justify human rights violations, when we have problems with the exploitation of precisely this kind of supposed diversity in contacts with China, for example. It encourages the involvement of civil society in paragraph 39, and stresses the importance of democratic freedoms and fundamental human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In all these areas, the report is worthy of support and praise. By the way, during the work of the Committee on Culture and Education, we were able to remove from the report the proposal to appoint a special EU ambassador solely for cultural affairs. These are the successes. Unfortunately, however, there are also matters which I would call problematic, which means that unfortunately, during the meetings of the Committee on Culture and Education, a change was made to the provision which said that this was about appointing a person who would be responsible only for cultural matters and nothing else. This is something to which attention should be called. The second thing – the report calls for additional training for European External Action Service staff in the fields of cultural and digital policies. In the Committee on Culture and Education, we did not want this provision to increase costs in this area, but unfortunately, that amendment fell. This is why my attitude to this report is simply one of ambivalence.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two reports by Mrs Schaake and Mrs Sanchez-Schmid remind us that culture is not a decoration motif but the fruit of complex interdependencies, showing that cultural questions should be addressed in a transverse manner and integrated into all European policies, internal as well as external, social as well as economic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this respect, I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue in this direction and to develop cooperation with the other committees, with the European Commission’s other services, as well as with Baroness Ashton’s European External Action Service.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I would like to come back to a point that has not been expanded on in these reports, concerning the mobility of artists and of professionals in the cultural sector. Indeed, this issue is of major importance for the emergence of a European cultural area. In this regard, two aspects seem to me to be important; namely, firstly, the dissemination by the European Union and Member States of clear and understandable information on regulations and procedures currently in force.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the removal – as has already been said – of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union. I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries. Therefore, Europe should reposition itself and not abandon the battle over soft power, since what is at stake here today is respect for cultural diversity as a tool for dialogue and as a guarantee of peace and stability worldwide.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to make a few general comments on all the debates that are being put to us this morning.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unfortunately, issues relating to education and culture are not given enough importance in this Chamber. Yet they are vital for our future, the future of Europe, the future of our youth. The under 30s account for 20% of the European population, but unemployment of the under 24s has now reached nearly 21%, and almost 15% of 18-24s leave further or higher education before the end of the second cycle and do not follow any additional study or training. Worse, nearly 25% of young people under 15 have reading difficulties. We cannot accept these figures and, with the recession, they are getting worse in a number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘Youth on the Move’ report submitted to us is a step in the right direction on certain points and conveys a number of messages to the Commission and to Member States. The European Parliament reaffirms its will not to see our youth sacrificed on the altar of austerity policies implemented across Europe. Let us hope that these will not be empty words!</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report also contains a number of worrying aspects, particularly when it demonstrates the desire to reform higher education curricula solely on the basis of market requirements, without going to the trouble of reaffirming the more general role of higher education with respect to the overall training of tomorrow’s citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that the broader young people’s training is, the better they can face life’s uncertainties, especially those uncertainties relating to work. Soon, we will have the opportunity to work on the issues involved in the Bologna process and I welcome that. All I would say is that our role is to listen to the growing worries – and the word is weak – in a number of States in relation to the reforms undertaken in the name of the Bologna process. We cannot sacrifice our youth; words are not enough in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to add a few words to thank Mrs Honeyball for her report and the work we have been able to do on the issues around childcare. I fully support the guidelines of this report. Conversely, I cannot share the guidelines of Mrs Sanchez-Schmid’s report on cultural industries, since these guidelines would introduce a commercial rationale, subject to market forces, to cultural goods.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to offer my resolute support to Mrs Pack for choosing Sarajevo as European capital of culture.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I wanted to say a few words about the Youth on the Move initiative. This initiative has a very fine objective – to increase the education and training of youth through mobility and ease the transition of young people from education into the labour market. This is particularly important today for young people who are one of the social groups hit hardest by the global financial crisis. Young people must be supported to enter the labour market in order to secure their own futures, as well as contribute to economic growth and prosperity. It is vital for young people to be able to develop the competences, skills and knowledge that will allow them to actively contribute to the growth and sustainable future of the European Union over the coming years. I believe that it is essential to ensure that the education they are receiving is conducive with the needs of the labour market. It is also important to ensure that Europe’s young people are not deprived of the opportunity to develop themselves and to contribute to the prosperity of the European Union. Mobility does cause certain problems. Young people who have gained an education in another Member State most often stay and work there. Therefore, a country such as Lithuania, which faces a tough economic situation, risks losing, for some time, educated people, who are the basis for the country’s growth, and not just in an economic sense. True, this is our own internal problem and we will solve it ourselves. Generally speaking, it is excellent that we are trying today to address an issue that is very important for young people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests from Thuringia in the visitors’ gallery,</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, to my colleague who is afraid of educated young people moving to another state, I would say that civilisation grows and develops when people move, and we ought not to be afraid of that. It happens wherever people from different countries meet and bring together their various experiences: the examples of this in Europe are very numerous and it is good that we have so much to say about mobility. This mobility will guarantee continued health and prosperity for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Zver’s report draws attention to numerous barriers that act as disincentives to mobility in Europe, and I would like to highlight some of them. To take up what Mr Løkkegaard briefly mentioned, it is really not acceptable that young people who are studying, training or working abroad should encounter difficulties, when they move, with the most basic tasks such as accessing banking services or renting an apartment. What is more, they are penalised by roaming charges when they try to telephone home or access the Internet and search online for basic, necessary information. Data roaming is extremely expensive.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission has proposed introducing a mobility scoreboard as part of the Youth on the Move initiative. This will permit systematic monitoring of Member States’ progress in dismantling barriers. The scoreboard should be comprehensive and straightforward so that it can serve as a real catalyst to Member States’ removing those obstacles. This would benefit both old and young, students and workers. I call on the Commission to present a detailed proposal on how this mobility scoreboard will be operated, and I hope it will do so as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">In conclusion, mobility is a horizontal issue, and I therefore urge my colleagues, on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and also on other committees, not to lose sight of the mobility dimension in their work in all areas.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, in an ageing Europe that is struggling to find answers to the global challenges of the future, the European Union and its Member States must seize this strong stimulus from Parliament to demonstrate that they can be more courageous, investing in future generations, in education and in culture. With these four reports and the Sarajevo proposal, Parliament calls for these issues to be placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3% of Europe’s gross product and employ 5 million people – a figure which rises to 7% if ancillary industries are taken into account. As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists &amp; Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments.</p>
      <p sl="it">What did we propose? First of all, that cultural tourism and fashion should be added to the eight sectors already included. We also hope that the Commission – and I am sure that Mrs Vassiliou will take action to ensure this happens – will submit a White Paper on cultural and creative industries as soon as possible in order to strengthen this cross-sectoral strategy throughout Europe and the Member States. Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis – as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival – means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report states that the European status of artists and of those engaged in creative professions should be officially recognised, and that in cultural industry, small and medium-sized enterprises should be fully recognised as such for the purposes of access to credit and support when starting up, especially for young people under the age of 35. It also promises to protect jobs, and to introduce specific training and innovative financial instruments, bearing in mind that capital in the creative sector often consists of values that are intangible but nonetheless crucial for innovation in all sectors.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Europe-wide cultural sector must be taken into consideration in the legal framework for international trade, certainly in the European dimension and in cultural diplomacy, in the internal market, in mobility …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for strategies like Youth on the Move to be effective and deliver measurable results, there must be increased education and business cooperation. While I agree with the rapporteur that education should not only ensure employability but also encourage creativity, there is a need for a move towards integrating education and business objectives. University programmes must be brought closer to the demands of the labour market. Young people should be given the opportunity to acquire, without barriers, the experience, skills, knowledge and know-how to equip themselves for future career paths and entrepreneurship. In particular, it is necessary to improve opportunities for young people in vocational education and training to facilitate their mobility in the European Union and allow for apprenticeships abroad, thus expanding their skill set and employability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mobility programmes and the benefits of the experience of working and studying abroad must be accessible to all young people regardless of the type of education they have chosen. Youth on the Move has the potential to be successful, but it must also translate into concrete measures that will deliver benefits for our young people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, in reality, we are holding a debate this morning about the significance of culture in the various policy areas – in foreign policy, in economic policy, in education policy and in social policy – and we all know that all of us benefit from culture being taken more seriously. The breaking out of democracy in the Arab countries would not be possible without this culturally-based desire for opening up, for cultural diversity, democracy and freedom of the press.</p>
      <p sl="de">Creative industries are an important part of economic policy. In my home country, Germany, there are more jobs in the creative sector than in the automotive sector. That is something we must take note of. The result is that this is also an important part of the Europe 2020 strategy. The point I want to make, however, is that, if we want to bolster the creative industries, we have work to do, in particular, on digital development. We know that it is precisely the producers of creative content that form the base of the value chain for the cultural sector. On the one hand, therefore, we have a major interest in cultural diversity, bolstering creative people and easy access to creative content online. Yet, at the same time, we want artists to be fairly paid, something that is not always the case in today’s digital world. We therefore need to amend contract law in order to strengthen the bargaining position of our artists. We need to develop new social models in order to find a fair balance between easy access for users and proper payment for those who create new content.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report on Youth on the Move contains some good ideas, like the demand that the crisis must not be used as an excuse to cut education spending. However, the report accepts the Bologna Process, which has increased the stranglehold of big business and furthered the process of commodification of education.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur referred to the fact that universities are underfunded, and therefore called for them to look for more funding from private sources. Surely the answer to underfunding is not to invite in the private sector with all the distorting effect that has on education, or to impose fees that block access to hundreds of thousands across Europe, but for state investment to provide free well-funded education at all levels. Furthermore, as a result of the brutal austerity, in many countries, it is virtually impossible for young people to get a decent job after finishing education. A quarter of young people in Ireland are now unemployed and 1 000 people emigrate every week, so for many Irish families, the very notion of Youth on the Move has a very different meaning. This unemployment crisis can only be solved on the basis of massive state investment to create decent jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, just when responsible people and governments are watching every penny, the Commission proposes more expense – Youth on the Move card, European skills passport, European Vacancy Monitor – through Europe 2020, all for cultural diplomacy and to get young people to travel when they do that already, backpacking their way round the world on their own initiative. What do we need expensive promotions for?</p>
      <p sl="en">As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: ‘United in Diversity’. Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the digitisation of cultural and artistic assets, I believe that the question is the following: is Europe destined to become a land of consumption for the United States, and soon for emerging countries, or will it finally wake up and put resources towards developing its informational, cultural but also economic potential?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, I firmly believe in the richness and diversity of European culture, but I am talking today from a perspective of competitiveness to condemn a piece of nonsense and an absurdity. The piece of nonsense is free services that some people dream of, access to everything for nothing. If we were to go down that road, there would be no more investment in this sector. Creators and inventors would not be able to receive fair remuneration and they would gradually disappear. Therefore, the economic models that we are going to implement for the online movement of our cultural heritage exclude services that are free of charge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The absurdity is the tax applied to dematerialised cultural assets from two aspects. First of all, there is a VAT distortion depending on the countries where the activity is based. For instance, American platforms have been enjoying a moratorium since 1998, which has led to their extraordinary boom. Secondly, there is a discrimination in VAT rates which penalises digital goods in relation to physical goods. I think that we need to address these two issues through legislation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I also welcome the opportunity that the debate we are holding gives us, a debate about four reports that we are going to vote on at the end of this morning’s session. These are reports that I think deal with issues that are very important to address, to try to provide solutions to the central problems in the European Union; reports that deal with how to address early school leaving, youth unemployment, the economic crisis and migratory movements.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this regard, firstly, I would like to make a brief comment about early childhood education. As Mrs Honeyball said, I believe it is one of the issues that has not been given the attention it deserves. We know – and every day we have more studies that confirm it – that it is during early childhood that the most intense development of our cognitive and emotional abilities takes place. For this reason, all the studies say that investing in the first years of life produces much better results than doing it later. I believe that it is time, beyond focusing on university studies or on professional training, as we have been doing, for us to concentrate on early childhood learning.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another report that seems very important to me is Youth on the Move, one of the main aims of which is to address early school leaving. I believe that this issue is absolutely connected to youth unemployment, with the very high percentage of unemployment that we have in our Union. We must provide answers for the future of these young people, who are the future of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, with regard to the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, I would like to highlight the importance of culture in our cooperation policies. It is important to create a better mutual understanding with third countries and, in these times of great upheaval to the south of our borders, I believe it makes a lot of sense to answer these questions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, ‘if you want to know where hell is, ask the artist, and if you cannot find the artist, you know you are in hell’. I think this quote, which I found by an anonymous author in Sarajevo, summarises the importance of arts and culture not only for open societies but also for our relations with the rest of the world. Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Sarajevo as its capital, belongs to one of the black holes on the European map, and this is due to our history. Now, however, we have to look to the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The people of Sarajevo have come close to knowing hell, especially during the siege of that city, and arts and culture have helped people there to survive. The orchestra rehearsed while the city was being shelled, and the winter festival full of arts and culture continued. Sarajevo deserves a European spring. The next generation suffers from the wounds of history, and we have an important responsibility as Europeans to look to the future with them and to include them in the European horizon.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully support Ms Pack’s initiative and I want to ask Parliament to support it and to do everything we can to include Sarajevo as a European cultural capital.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the parts of Mrs Schaake’s report which speak about the need to increase the mobility of young people from European neighbouring countries are very important. While, on the one hand, it seems to me that over-involvement of the European Union in cultural activity in the Member States is not necessary, I think, on the other, that in view of what is happening today in Tunisia, but also in view of the events of two months ago in Belarus, it is important that the European Union, with its cultural message and its message about democracy and the rule of law, addresses itself to the young elite of neighbouring countries, and that money is found for youth exchanges, joint courses of study, travel, the establishment of universities and support for teaching programmes. Such programmes do exist in the Member States – at the Centre for East European Studies in the University of Warsaw in Poland, for example. This should be seen as an example, and it is to be welcomed that Mrs Schaake is pointing us in this direction today. Without this, we will not be able to achieve anything.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, visitors in the gallery, it is a great honour for me, perhaps no longer as a youngster, but still as a new Member of this House, to be speaking here for the first time.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to characterise the flagship Youth on the Move initiative, part of the Europe 2020 programme, as an excellent objective for the greatest possible improvement of the entry of young people into the labour market, with two main emphases. As well as early years education, it targets, firstly, the reduction of school drop-out rates and, secondly, increasing the number of graduates. As a result, to a not inconsiderable degree, of the setbacks caused by the economic crisis, but also, and above all, as a result of structural deficiencies in many – almost all – Member States in other areas, the Member States of the EU have completely different prerequisites.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to cite my own home country as an example: Austria has a school drop-out rate of just 8.7%, as compared to the EU average of around 14%, and it would certainly be worth examining Austria’s dual system of vocational training, which is supported by the social partners. Germany, too, is very successful in this area. Let us take that as the benchmark. Austria itself, however, should strive to achieve a benchmark when it comes to the unsatisfactory number of highly qualified graduates there. There are considerably higher numbers of qualified academics in other Member States, and we should study their systems. There is much that we can learn from each other in these areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">The failures demonstrate very clearly that there is a need for action – we need to overcome the gulf between the education system and the labour market quickly and efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="de">In closing, however, I would just like to offer my sincere thanks to Mrs Pack and to support her when I say that having Sarajevo as a European Capital of Culture is not a derogation, it is a must!</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, there are countries in the European Union which have a national unemployment rate of 20%, but a youth unemployment rate of 40%. It is not the case in just one country, but in very many countries, where the average youth unemployment rate is twice the average national level.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If we are talking about European integration or the future of these programmes and projects which we have in mind here, all these young people must feel European. All these young people must also find their future within the European Union’s borders. This is why I strongly feel that we ought to talk much more about providing young people with access to jobs and about the future these young people have in the European Union when we mention the ‘Youth on the Move’ programme.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that the solutions we are providing to these issues are not good enough and that we should focus much greater attention on the way in which Member States implement the projects and programmes which we have in mind here.

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, at a time when cultural differences between nations are leading bureaucrats to close borders – as most recently demonstrated by the Danes – and build high walls, they prefer to leave conflicts to be resolved with arms rather than with understanding and compassion. At a time when artistic achievements are becoming single-use goods and a major source of profit, when all-powerful global monopolies are being created, which are dictating trends and values, the report on the cultural dimension of our External Action Service and the cultural dimension of the European Union as a whole is more than just welcome.</p>
      <p sl="sl">The report talks us through the ways in which our common cultural image and the artistic achievements of small nations and Member States of the European Union in contact with the cultures of other nations can raise the standard of our public debate and even ease our diplomats’ and strategists’ burden in finding solutions to innumerable crises, at home and around us. By refusing to observe borders, new media and new technologies are opening up immense opportunities in the process. I would have liked the report to have devoted a word or two to books, to the idea, for example, that books should not be subject to taxation. We could speak of cultural management or about giving a new impetus to the one-time idea of Melina Mercouri for a European Capital of Culture.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the process of early childhood education is one of the most important duties both of parents and the state. In this context, it is important and appropriate that the resolution stresses the significance of the early teaching of regional and minority languages. Of particular importance is teaching using the mother tongue as the medium of instruction, because it is known that the language in which children think is also the one in which they more successfully assimilate knowledge. Therefore, it is unacceptable that in schools for indigenous national minorities, instruction in a language other than the mother tongue should be introduced from the first and second years, something which was recently decided by the Lithuanian Parliament. The compulsory introduction of bilingual instruction is understood unequivocally by the Poles who have lived in Lithuania for over seven centuries as discrimination which should be brought to an end.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am very sorry to hear the consequences of the earthquake in your country.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I would like to applaud the work of Mary Honeyball on the early years learning report. I can sense from the text the effort that has been made to overcome ideological prejudices and find a compromise across the political spectrum. This is right and proper, as it involves the family and the well-being of children. Parents have the main responsibility for raising and educating their children. This is also confirmed by the references made by the rapporteur to the articles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The responsibility of parents is also mentioned in the General Declaration of Human Rights – parents have a preferential right to choose the type of education for their children.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I also share the belief that investment in education and in early years learning will bring a return in future prosperity. There is evidence that children already develop the foundations of responsibility, understanding and social behaviour in their early years. The report also emphasises that caring for young people is the best way to prevent future juvenile criminality. I go into these factors in greater depth in the report prepared on the contribution made to the fight against juvenile criminality by policies on gender equality and parental responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Just like the rapporteur, I, too, am opposed to artificially increasing the percentage of women on the labour market at any price. Many mothers would prefer to care for their young children rather than have formal employment. They do not have the freedom to choose, however, as society places little if any value on the work of women in the home and in caring for children. The submitted report contains no proposals for states to place a financial value on the work of mothers in raising and educating children, at least in proportion to the contributions states make to the running of pre-school facilities. The report as a whole is a step in the right direction, and future social developments will oblige us to pay more attention to this topic.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the ‘Youth on the Move’ initiative focuses on strengthening the mobility of young people, mainly for the purpose of employment. However, in times of economic crisis and when values are being questioned, the mobility of young people cannot be linked solely to preventing unemployment. With conservative trends threatening the unity of the European Union, and we heard some of them this morning, the mobility of young people can be used as an important instrument for strengthening European cohesion. The needs of the market should be taken into account as a secondary factor.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, universities should maintain their independence and public character and their courses should retain their academic and research-based orientation. Higher education in the European Union should not be confined to reproducing models which created both the crisis and the loss of confidence. On the contrary, they should aim to create new standards of social cohesion and collectivity which the humanities and a European system of university classification based on them can develop in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, visitors, the cultural diversity of Europe is an important commodity that we need to preserve and even develop in future. In order to make that possible, we need to face the challenges of the digital age not only in the information and knowledge society, but also, above all, in the cultural and creative sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">Cultural diversity is not just an ideal; it is also a significant economic factor. Around five million people in the European Union are employed in the cultural sector. That equates to around 2.5% of the total population. The cultural sector is a growth sector that is developing faster than many other areas in the economy. The development of information and communications technologies is driven just as much by the content offered by the cultural sector as the nature and quality of that content have been changed and developed through technology. We therefore need a framework for the cultural and creative sector within which it can develop sustainably in the face of the challenges of the digital age. We need a modern, accessible and legally certain system in which everyone can develop on an equal footing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The cultural and creative sector is a driver for Europe. We therefore need to pay some attention to this area, including when it comes to education and training. We need to provide young people with cultural and creative skills – including within the scope of lifelong learning. However, we also need to improve the business skills of our creative artists and to give them a sound media grounding in new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to create a framework within which those engaged in the cultural sector can safeguard their livelihoods. We therefore need to work intensively on the issues of copyright, social security and intellectual property, but also on open access to information and content, in order to ensure the continued development of the creative and cultural sector in the future in a digital environment and in order to enable us to retain cultural diversity and the cultural heritage of Europe as a significant distinguishing feature of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ‘Life is beautiful, my love. You look out on the world and it is already yours’. These first lines of a simple poem show how great life is, and remind us that we are responsible for the world we are building for our children. In the report presented, Mrs Honeyball offers a timely reminder that the future of our children is shaped right from the very first years of their life, years in which institutions must take on a key role if our children are to grow up as we wish.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with all the points made by the report: it is important that the Member States and the Union should shoulder responsibility for measures to support children’s early learning, but they must claim a role that cannot be solely delegated to parents, or to those who work in the education sector. As I always maintain at meetings of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, parents living in poverty mean children raised in poverty. Children have the right to receive help and services from Member States and from the Union. If we are to overcome poverty, social exclusion and illiteracy, we must support our children from their first steps.</p>
      <p sl="it">To this end, we must invest in care and education from the earliest childhood, and monitor the services provided and the proficiency of providers. All children must be able to access education, regardless of social background, and we must ensure that this opportunity is also available to the children of asylum seekers, refugees and all those who have permission, even if only temporary, to reside within the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mrs Honeyball emphasises research and the exchange of best practices, the wise use of Structural Funds and programmes such as Comenius, and, finally, the need for the States to reclaim their crucial role in the earliest years of children’s education, to ensure that objectives for smart, inclusive and sustainable growth are met.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the report on early years learning is not and cannot be an attempt at the unified arrangement of this highly individual matter. I see it, however, as an important contribution to the debate on common European aims and values in pre-school education. The research in this area emphasises the significant role which pre-school care has for the healthy development of children and their further integration into society. It seems that pre-school education has a positive effect also on the further education of the child, and that investing in early years learning in the broadest sense of the word is more effective than any later intervention. It is therefore in our interest to support this type of education, also with a view to achieving, among other things, the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and increasing the number of inhabitants with a high quality university education, while at the same time reducing the proportion of people who do not complete their studies. High quality pre-school education can bring us much closer to these objectives, perhaps more than we are willing to admit at the moment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Honeyball for the work she has done. Ensuring that all children have access to education and support structures in their earliest childhood must become a right both for parents, especially for mothers, but, above all, for children themselves, because it means that they can lay solid foundations for their education, be supported in their social integration and personal development, and have a better chance of finding a job once they become adults.</p>
      <p sl="it">More generally – as other fellow Members have reiterated – the Commission’s Communication on the EU strategy on the Rights of the Child states that, in 2009, more than 6 million young people dropped out of the school system, having barely completed lower secondary education and, of these, 17.4% did not go beyond primary school. These figures are worrying and lead one to think that the school and educational system is often neglected and does not receive the investment it needs.</p>
      <p sl="it">Investing in the quality of education, right from the first years of life, represents not only an essential starting point for a child’s cognitive, sensory and motor development, but is also a prerequisite for building an inclusive society that offers a wealth of opportunities for future generations.</p>
      <p sl="it">In addition, the improvement in the quality and number of nursery schools and structures for early childhood – as provided for in the objectives set out in the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Barcelona – allows working parents to balance home life and work. Unfortunately, however, the statistics show that many Member States still have a long way to go before they reach these objectives.</p>

We must remember this and attach enormous importance to this discussion, bearing in mind that not everything has been given us forever.

Today, if we want European society to be mobile and young people to be open, sensitive and competent, we should have a responsible approach to the whole area of education, and, after all, the indicators we have at present are alarmingly poor. One third of the citizens of Europe do not have any vocational qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As for the cultural dimension, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information that the European External Action Service is going to have ambassadors and cultural attachés in all the countries of the world. I would like to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, because support for culture means, above all, support for the business connected with culture, but, in particular, it means support for the inner aspect of culture. This is why cultural undertakings must have administrative support and need a reduction of bureaucracy in administrative systems, but they also need support with raising capital, which may also come from Union funds. We share this mission together, and this is why, as I close, I would like to ask the Commissioner to relate this serious and important discussion to the Council, which is absent today, so that in the forum of the Council, too, it will be possible to discuss these important tasks for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Development for the report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries, I consider it important that the cultural and creative industries have been recognised as an instrument for local and regional development. Plenty of regions are still lagging behind – for reasons that include the financial crisis – and cultural and creative projects will certainly help towards creating jobs and making these regions competitive.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is important for Member States, regions and local authorities to make the best possible use of EU programmes supporting culture and creativity, political cohesion, structural policy and others. The definition of the funding options is important for the cultural and creative industries. Funding is the greatest obstacle to growth for many businesses. It is therefore also important for private capital and public/private partnerships to be brought into culture and the creative industries, as the rapporteur requests, and to emphasise the importance of sponsorship. I support the motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, it is great that we are discussing this important matter this morning and it shows how serious we are about cultural and educational matters.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Culture and education are intrinsically valuable in themselves. Both have a huge part to play in creating a united Europe and in the development of our economies as we move forward. The initiatives we are discussing here this morning would facilitate that.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Youth on the Move is a wonderful initiative. Many have benefited from it already and will do so into the future, but one thing is vital and that is that there is mutual recognition in all Member States of qualifications and diplomas. This would facilitate greater movement, but also raise the standard in each of the institutions.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I also have to say – mea culpa – that I am a late convert to early childhood education. Like many, I thought it was basically a babysitting service, but now I know that it is the best investment and it gives the best return for investment in education at any level. Certainly it reflects an old Irish saying, ‘well begun is half done’, and it can be done at early childhood level.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I also want to emphasise the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR), in particular, for actors. Many of them are living on the breadline and they deserve to benefit from their genius and this certainly can be done by protecting the IPR online and offline environments.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I also want to put on my sporting hat and say that sport is a very important part of culture and education as well. I have called for an indigenous festival of sport in Europe. If we do that, then we can contribute greatly to sport as part of our culture.</p>
      <p sl="ga">My last point is that I visited Mannheim last year. There, under the one roof, was a music school which involved production, performance, education, the creation of instruments, etc. This is something that could be emulated in other places.</p>

      <p sl="es">Commissioner, in 1989, the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, stated that education and culture should be the soul of Europe. We now know that it is not only the soul, but the heart and muscles of Europe. Without equal opportunities, which improve the opportunities of all children and all young Europeans, without social cohesion, which provides education, without the ability to compete, which contributes to the spread of knowledge among all citizens, the European Union will be weak. However, with all of that and culture, it will have the place it deserves in the world.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in 2014, it will be 100 years since the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which triggered the start of the First World War. It was also in Bosnia and Herzegovina that we had a bloody war in Europe in the 1990s. It is important to mark those tragic events, which led to many deaths, suffering, division and horrors, but it is even more important to mark and celebrate European unity and peace today.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sarajevo is a city which, despite everything that happened, has maintained its multicultural spirit and strength. In order to recognise this, it would be a strong symbolic gesture to name Sarajevo European Capital of Culture 2014, to reaffirm Europe’s message of peace and stability. It is a pity to miss out on this historic momentum by turning to the rules. It is only when we deal with our past, when we recognise and face history, that we can look openly to the future, so please give Sarajevo this possibility.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, for an ageing Europe, it is vital that all young people make the most of their talents and succeed in the labour market later on This requires an education that, already in early childhood, aims to balance the disparity of opportunities; one that pays special attention to providing education, professional training, and employment advantages to every young person, irrespective of their financial situation, social and ethnic background, and disabilities or perhaps other health problems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The 2020 strategy aims to raise the level of tertiary education to 40% and to reduce the share of early school leavers to 10%. To achieve this goal, every Member State must aim to go in this direction. There are places where nowadays, we see exactly opposing tendencies: a decrease in the age limit for compulsory education and a reduction in the number of state-funded higher education places.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, first of all, we should look at the context in which we are having this debate. We need to compare the fine words we are hearing here on the importance of culture and education with the reality. The irrefutable reality is of a sharp divestment in these areas; a retreat of the state that threatens its social role and has the result of exacerbating inequalities in access to education, to knowledge and to culture. The result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reality in Member States such as Portugal is the closure of thousands of schools, thousands of teachers being without a job or a secure job, and the chronic underfunding of the state higher-education system and the increased cost of attending it. The reality is that budgets for culture are being slashed to penury levels.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Let us not, therefore, ignore this reality that investment is urgently needed: all the more so if the shameful and obscurantist intervention plan drawn up by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission is implemented.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to express my sympathy with your compatriots; we look on Spain as a friend and sympathise whenever anything happens there. The ‘Youth on the Move’ report is one of the most important initiatives included in the EU 2020 strategy for promoting and providing more opportunities for education and training for young people and helping them to make the transition from education to the labour market. Education, lifelong learning, innovation and culture certainly lead to progress. There is a Greek proverb which says that heads make capital, not the other way round, which is why we must identify, highlight and develop the skills and abilities of our young people, which we can do if we ensure that they can find employment in keeping with their qualifications and skills.</p>

      <p sl="en">They talk approvingly of diversity, but welcome the eradication of diversity between nations. The diversity that they promote within Member States involves the promotion of the cultures of recent arrivals, which are anything but European. As populations change, so will their cultures. Indigenous cultures will be displaced and lost. They talk about freedom of expression but are only convincing when they express their intolerance of those with whom they disagree.</p>
      <p sl="en">They want to promote only cultural values of which they approve; those consistent with so-called ‘European’ values.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the present situation of young people in Europe is very worrying – as you are aware – since there are five million young people out of work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I am delighted with the European Commission’s ambition to want to democratise young people’s access in Europe. However, I believe that we have to go beyond this ‘Youth on the Move’ programme and, above all, avoid the trap of wanting every young person to go to university. We need to be relevant to all groups of young people, including those who are the furthest removed from the European Union and especially, of course, apprentices. It is with this in mind, I believe, that we should urgently introduce a genuine mobility programme for these target groups, in addition to the Leonardo programme. I think that the Erasmus name, the Erasmus hallmark, should be used for all the programmes and in a variety of forms, in particular, for apprentices, so that we have the necessary ambitions to achieve our aims.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, this is an opportunity for an extraordinary commitment to the social mobility of young people and a decisive commitment to training a generation with an open worldview; a generation with skills that, because it has global vision and thinking, is capable of contributing to its regions’ development and to Europe’s progress. This is because, if all young Europeans have the experience of study, of a work placement or of employment in a different country, they will not just acquire more skills, greater independence and better vision, but they will, above all, gain enormous added value from contact with other young Europeans and exchanging experiences with them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">More than ever, Europe needs a generation of Europeans who know and trust each other, and who know and trust Europe, in order to carry the project forward. Therefore, allow everyone from Fajã Grande in the Azores, Europe’s westernmost point, to participate. We must ensure that no one be left out for financial reasons.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the report on early years learning includes a mention of the work experience approach to education for children from poorer families. Of these, the rapporteur identifies children from Roma families, who have very little access to early years learning, as the most at-risk group.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore very important for Member States to create specific conditions for access to early years learning for children whose families do not, for various reasons, provide them with the sort of material and family support that would enable them to take part in the standard education system without major problems. Special care for children from the more at-risk groups, however, must be provided in a very sensitive way, in order to avoid stigmatising these children or families, which might increase the risk of their social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must therefore systematically modify and improve the special care mechanisms for these children, so that we can successfully integrate as many children as possible from at-risk groups into our society.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the first three years of a child’s life are crucial for the development of the brain and for language learning. Without a certain level of language acquisition, further learning is scarcely possible, as the language deficits can only be overcome with great difficulty with increasing age.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge. At the same time, it declares that migrant families and minorities such as the Roma make much less use of the early years education offered than other families. We cannot allow it to be the case that the level of our schools continues to fall and fall because so many children quite simply cannot understand the teaching. In other words, every child – migrant or not – must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the work on creating a European early years learning framework based on shared goals and values points us in the right direction for the harmonisation of our education systems. Stressing the importance of the first years of life in a person’s subsequent development and emphasising the potential inherent in early childhood is extremely important in the context of implementation of the 2020 strategy. To my mind, the subject we are discussing is exceptionally relevant to the current situation. In my country, a new law entered into force last month on forms of care for children up to three years old. The new law extends the range of childcare facilities and introduces several new forms of care: children’s clubs, day carers, legal nannies and workplace nurseries. These changes are meant to create favourable conditions for the proper development of children. The variety of educational possibilities allows this development to be assisted and stimulated in all areas while making use of the child’s own natural potential. Opening workplace nurseries will make it easier for parents to return to the labour market after a longer break.</p>

It is good that the Commission has focused on this crucial moment of entering into the labour market, which is exactly what I would like to focus on too. Young people are confronted with the sad reality, with the bad working conditions of internships today, even with exploitation.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by expressing the Commission’s sympathy for, and solidarity with, the people of Lorca and its neighbourhood. As a child, I experienced a very strong earthquake in my home city, and I know how horrible the experience is.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Europeans, we should not be satisfied with the situation of the European education system. We cannot accept that one in seven of our young people leaves school without the skills and qualifications that he or she needs in order to find employment and have a fulfilling life. Nor do I accept that one in five of our young children cannot read properly.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have to really give our full attention to our education systems. We have to strengthen them by strengthening our mobility programmes, because through mobility, young children, students, workers and volunteers get the transversal skills that they cannot get through formal education. I think that cutting our budgets on education is a very short-sighted policy. Once again, I plead with the Member States and governments not to do that, especially in times of crisis, because this will have very negative repercussions in the future. We must work together to ensure that, in the next multiannual financial framework, the provision for education and mobility is higher than at present, because that is what we need in order to exit the crisis and give meaning to our people.</p>
      <p sl="en">One honourable Member made a reference to subsidiarity. Let me assure you that all our policies and all our recommendations on education and culture fully recognise, and comply with, subsidiarity rules. We do not dictate to Member States. We simply make recommendations to Member States. We give them the platform to work together to exchange good practices and to learn from each other.</p>
      <p sl="en">Cultural and creative industries are important – as many of you have mentioned – as a motor for development and for job creation. However, let us also remember that these creative and cultural industries have a value per se. Creativity and culture are values of the European Union which we have strengthened and have to maintain. After analysing the input that we have received on this topic from all the stakeholders, and following the public consultation with the stakeholders, we are about to put forward recommendations on how we should strengthen and support cultural and creative industries in order to develop and produce the results that we expect them to.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the external dimension of culture – culture in our external relations – I think we have a responsibility to do this. Let us not forget that we have all signed and adopted the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity. We have to work with all the countries which have adopted the convention in order to ensure that it is implemented. Let me stress that such cultural exchanges with the outside world will be beneficial not only for them, but also for us, because we are enriching our culture, our knowledge, and our values in the world.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, thank you for having conducted this debate with as much democracy and generosity as to enable many of my fellow Members to participate. The debate has, above all, been a high quality one and it has focused on the following: we want to strengthen and maintain our current mobility programmes which are part of the lifelong learning and Youth on the Move programmes. Our message to Member States is that they should pay more attention to, and also invest more money in, youth policies which span several sectors. We also want this debate to yield a further benefit; we want Member States to continue reforming their education systems and social policies, as well as their markets and the like.</p>
      <p sl="sl">I would like to respond to one objection which cropped up during the debate. The Youth on the Move dossier does not focus very much on the importance of the market; we actually wanted to avoid that question altogether, but we have emphasised in several places that education systems need to adapt to the needs of society and the economy, and that this large gulf, this large gap, should be reduced as much as possible and that young people should be enabled to enter the labour market with as few obstacles as possible. Interestingly, that is precisely what the youth organisations pointed out during the preparation of the report.</p>
      <p sl="sl">By way of conclusion, I would briefly like to emphasise the following: let us make use of all this positive energy that we have here in the European Parliament, the temple of European democracy, as well as in the European Commission, and let us do everything to ensure this report does not remain merely a dead letter.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I should like to thank everyone for the helpful and constructive way that we have conducted this debate today. The overwhelming majority of you, with only one or two notable exceptions, were very much in favour of my report on early years learning and the other reports we debated today.

It is not only important for children, for the very young children I have been talking about and the young people that my colleague has been talking about, but it is also important for the future of Europe. I therefore strongly support what the Commissioner has said, that Member States should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts, because making cuts in education would be the worse possible thing to do.</p>
      <p sl="en">Education is about our future, it is about having adults who are employable, who are fit, who are healthy, who are not a drain on our social services.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am coming back to you with some concrete next steps on the report on the role of culture in the EU’s external actions that we talked about this morning. I want to start with a quote from a Hungarian diplomat in the United States, Mr Simonyi, who said that ‘rock and roll, culturally speaking, was a decisive element in loosening up communist societies and bringing them closer to the world of freedom’. When we look, in particular, at today’s uprisings of the young generation in North Africa and the Middle East, we can see that, today, an open Internet is that decisive element for moving into the world of freedom. We need an Internet freedom strategy to facilitate free expression, press freedom, access to information and access to cultural and educational content.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a priority, but there are many more concrete suggestions in the report, for which the foundations are already laid down in both the Lisbon Treaty and the ratification of the UNESCO conventions. They now need practical implementation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The External Action Service should coordinate the work of different Directorates-General and create a Directorate-General for cultural and digital diplomacy. EEAS staff should be trained, and a cultural attaché is needed in each EU representation. There needs to be coordination, streamlining and mainstreaming through an interinstitutional taskforce which should report back to the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Existing programmes, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, have cultural components which need to be coordinated and strategically deployed.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, after all these speeches, I wish to thank my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs as well as the rapporteurs of the committees who produced opinions, who suggested to me many ideas and who have made it possible to improve the text that we are voting on today.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would now like to look further down the road with you. How are we going to follow up on this report? We are asking the European Commission to draw up a White Paper, following on from its Green Paper, so as to perform a review leading to a genuine strategy for the creative and cultural industries. We are also eagerly awaiting legislative proposals on how cultural goods are taxed, on the governance of collective management societies, and on budget allocations for the programmes relating to culture, education and media.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must turn our ambitions into specific measures. Why not introduce straight away a reduced VAT for all cultural products, whether they use a physical medium or are online? Disparities in taxation produce distortions that, without exception, run counter to the competitiveness of European companies. The Americans have had a competitive advantage for a long time thanks to a tax moratorium on these services. Will Europe do something about it? Why not also consider a single price for digital books across Europe? French politician, Edouard Herriot, once said: ‘Culture is what we are left with when we have forgotten everything’. Nevertheless, culture can be quickly forgotten if we do not protect it, if we do not maintain it, if we are not interested in it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that Europe will give itself the means to promote its culture, so that its model and heritage can exert influence, so that Europe can defend its identity and is able to grow its economy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The future of the European Union rests on its young people, on their potential and ability to embrace the current EU project and take it to a new dimension of inclusion and cooperation between Member States. The first condition ensuring that the young people of today become Europe’s citizens of tomorrow is for them to get to know one another. This means them coming into contact with as many cultures as possible within Europe, moving around freely and studying in as many Member States as possible. With this in mind, I think that lifelong learning programmes, such as Erasmus or Leonardo da Vinci, must receive more substantial financial support from the authorities in the coming years. Europe needs an ever-growing number of its school pupils and students to come into contact with a new social, educational and cultural model. I believe that the mobility programmes aimed at young people will successfully bring about a real change in the attitude of Europe’s young people and create a shared vision for them about what Europe stands for, in areas from education, science and research to culture and our common values.</p>

      <p sl="it">Ever since the 1990s, the European Union has seen an exponential increase in cultural and creative industries (CCIs), in terms of the number of jobs they have created and their contribution to gross domestic product. The nature of these industries is twofold: from an economic perspective, they help generate jobs and growth, and from a cultural perspective, they facilitate the social integration of citizens. The Commission’s Green Paper officially recognises the economic and social importance of this sector of the economy. However, whereas some of our international partners are already making extensive use of the many resources offered by CCIs, the European Union has not yet developed a strategy based on cultural activities. In my opinion, the challenges posed by globalisation offer these industries great opportunities for development, which are likely to increase economic and employment growth potential. In concrete terms, the ability of CCIs to boost social and territorial cohesion will depend on strategic investment. It will also be necessary to cooperate with local bodies, to pass on expertise and to exchange good practices. I also believe that the stronger safeguarding of intellectual property rights is an essential condition for protecting cultural diversity in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The European Commission communication entitled ‘Early Childhood Education and Care’ (ECEC) is a welcome initiative, because it examines problems in children’s education and aims to establish means of providing children with the best start for the world of tomorrow. However, in my opinion, this Commission document lacks analysis of research and data on children’s education, care and social protection, taking into account information from all 27 European Union Member States. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the close link between socio-economic disadvantage and opportunities to educate and teach children from an early age, because families on low incomes are much less likely to use ECEC services. Consequently, later on, some of these young people are neither employed nor in education or training. I understand the Commission’s efforts to encourage the Member States to exchange examples of good policy and practice, making use of the open method of coordination, but it would be much more useful and effective to draft and adopt common quality criteria. This would promote data collection and benchmarking in all European Union Member States, because data collection is particularly important for observing progress and measuring outcomes. I would like to point out that there is a particular lack of information on children from families with social problems, on children with special needs and disadvantaged children.</p>

      <p sl="cs">This own-initiative report is devoted to the issue of the study mobility of young people, which arises from the 2020 strategy. It is undoubtedly right to increase the competitiveness of young people by creating conditions within the framework of university education for them to spend at least one year in another Member State. Mobility, a system of recognising credits and other measures will limit the growth in unemployment among young people, which stands at an average of 21% in the EU today, which is an alarming figure. Personally I very much welcome the appeal to the Commission and the Member States regarding support for voluntary activities, and for measures to be introduced in legislation that would make it possible to recognise voluntary activity by the unemployed as time spent working. This measure will lead, particularly with young people, to a strengthening of work habits, to greater competitiveness and to greater motivation in seeking work. In my opinion, it is no less important to have a permanent link between the requirements of the labour market and professional education, a link that has to be highly flexible in this regard, so that future graduates can be best placed on the labour market, bringing about a gradual reduction in unemployment among young people.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I would like to emphasise my strong support for the ‘Youth on the Move’ framework, aimed at improving education systems and vocational training in Europe. I think that this is of paramount importance with a view to developing specific policies supporting youth mobility and facilitating a stable transition for them from the education system to employment. An important factor which needs to be considered is that young people are one of the social groups hit hard by the global economic crisis. We have a duty to support young people entering the labour market, both for their sakes and to support the European economy. Today’s young people are the leaders of tomorrow. This is why it is vital for them to have the opportunity to develop their skills, abilities and knowledge now so that, in the near future, they can make an active contribution to the European Union’s growth and development. We must lay the foundations for concrete policies which will support young people and provide them with greater mobility and opportunities to study abroad. The role of this mobility is not only to support the economy but, at the same time, to make an extremely important contribution to creating cultural cohesion at European level.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I consider our discussion devoted to education and culture to be an important one, and would like to add an approach that so far has been missing from numerous important considerations. Mutual understanding and respect for one another are fundamental conditions for traditional national communities, minorities and majorities living together harmoniously and prosperously. Education plays a vital role here. If the history and literature of minority communities were taught in majority schools, and if minority education efforts were to include majority culture, communities living together would get along with each other more harmoniously. Language education also has a prominent role in cultural understanding. This is true not only in the process of learning world languages, but also in the relationship between majorities and minorities living alongside each other. I believe that it is not only minorities who should have to study the language of the majority, but also vice versa. Everybody could live a richer life, allowing mutual respect for one another to manifest itself. At the same time, in knowing each other’s language, generations growing up would develop a much more positive attitude towards each other, allowing them to create relationships with their peers of the same age more easily, which would be decisive with regard to the future of these regions. And lastly, I find it important to mention the importance of a deep understanding of cultural heritage, so that communities living together can recognise and respect each other’s cultural values. I believe that the concrete task of the Commission is to promote all of these issues, while that of Parliament is to strengthen theoretical and political support.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Young people are the driving force of any society and its future. Their education, vocational training, qualifications and integration into the labour market provide the basis for achieving the Europe 2020 objectives aimed at smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This is why I firmly believe that Europe must continue to invest in their development and initiatives like Erasmus, Leonardo and ‘Youth on the Move’ should be constantly developed further and made popular. Improving the quality of education and training, as well as young people’s access to it, are important steps on the way to reducing unemployment and developing the European economy. Unfortunately, Europe still has regions and social groups where there are limited conditions for this. Efforts must be coordinated to resolve this problem. It is also important for education and training programmes to be more closely linked to business needs and to stimulate young people’s potential and creativity so as to make them more competitive on the labour market. I support the efforts to encourage youth mobility, both during their education and in connection with their professional life. I think that this is an important condition for developing new skills and their self-awareness of their European identity.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The cultural dimension of the EU’s external actions is one which is important and very much needed. Around the world generally, European culture is seen as attractive and desirable. It is more difficult to find acceptance for European values. Working in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I have repeatedly experienced cultural differences and their consequences.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As Europeans, we try systematically to promote values and principles which, for us, are fundamental and inalienable. This quite often meets with a lack of understanding from our partners. Some of them see in this nothing less than a kind of cultural imperialism. This is precisely why it is so difficult to persuade our partners that the values promoted by the European Union are not an attempt to impose our way of thinking on others. The fact that we try to spread our ideals, for example, in the field of human rights, follows simply from a moral imperative. We respect difference and diversity, but we cannot give up principles which we consider to be fundamental. We will not accept discrimination, and we will not give up the protection of human life and human dignity. On this, the Union is united and in full accord.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I would like to congratulate Mr Honeyball on his excellent work, and for having noticed critical items that may not have received sufficient attention in the past. These include, in particular, recognising the connection between poverty, a disadvantaged situation, and poor school performance. I would like to remind my fellow Members that there is an additional connection: the disadvantaged situation is particularly pronounced in cases where the child is living with disabilities that the parents, who are inadequately informed, neither understand nor accept. I will pay careful attention to this problem in the report I am currently working on. The work carried out by Mrs Honeyball and, in particular, the adoption of a child-centred approach, will be an excellent reference base in the future. The draft report ‘draws attention to the general importance of studies before entering school, with particular emphasis on language learning as well as multilingualism and linguistic diversity’, which I support joyfully and enthusiastically. I agree that supporting the early development of disabled children and helping them acquire adequate linguistic competence is a basic human resources investment which represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is also important that in order to develop the linguistic competence of deaf children, they must first learn their mother tongue (sign language), which will allow them to become truly multilingual in the future. And this is an investment for reaching the EU2020 goals and for raising the level of employment, in order to achieve a more accessible, inclusive and sustainable society.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Support for youth mobility, especially for young people from the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean, is particularly important in view of recent events in Belarus and North Africa. The processes of democratic transformation which are currently beginning in Egypt and Tunisia can be strengthened thanks to the EU’s efforts to educate the citizens of these countries in the spirit of democracy and respect for the rule of law and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Educated citizens are the greatest enemy of dictators and totalitarian regimes. The experiences of EU Member States can be used when organising such programmes. In Poland, for example, there is the Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Programme, which is operated, among others, by the Centre for East European Studies in the University of Warsaw – an international study centre which enables students from the East and the Balkans to study in Poland. The Union should also intensify efforts to establish a University of the Eastern Partnership, modelled on the Euro-Mediterranean University in Slovenia. The EU should support the initiatives of young and talented people to promote particular political strategies. A good example of such activity is the website Eastbook.eu, whose founders supply thousands of Internet users every day with information about events in the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the progress of the programme. The EU should also give support to young people from Member States for study visits to neighbourhood countries. This helps break down cultural barriers. Worthy of praise here is the Eurobus initiative – a journey around Ukraine organised every year for young people from the EU’s Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The adoption in June last year of a new EU strategy, Europe 2020, is intended to help bring us out of the economic crisis and contribute to further development of the European Union. It is also a significant step in terms of maintaining and even increasing youth mobility.</p>
      <p sl="pl">One of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is the Youth on the Move initiative, the aim of which is to improve the results of our systems of education and make it easier for young people to enter the labour market. This aim is to be achieved, as the name suggests, by developing the idea of youth exchange and helping young people to acquire new skills. Statistical data show that currently, as many as 15% of young people end their education early, and in so doing gain qualifications which do not meet the needs of the labour market. In addition, only around a third of people have completed tertiary education, and this proportion is significantly lower than in the United States or Japan, for example. Therefore, one of the most important challenges facing the European Union is the need to give particular attention and financial support to these two problems. However, the situation will not improve if both the Commission and the Member States do not follow the guidelines contained in the Europe 2020 strategy. Youth mobility is a key to the further development of Europe, and if we aspire to the status of the world’s most innovative economy, we must not neglect to invest in human capital, and particularly in young people.</p>

      <p sl="ro">In the context of the current economic crisis, the EU needs a global strategy based on innovation and creativity, which will contribute to economic growth and job creation. This is precisely why the cultural and creative industries must be encouraged. Consequently, I think that we need to ensure at the moment in Europe that there is a greater distribution of creative works and free access is provided to them online without, however, ignoring the fact that the artists and their works must be protected and receive fair remuneration. With this in mind, we must set up a legislative framework capable of supporting the development of these industries and of instilling confidence in consumers and those operating in the digital market, as this sector may facilitate the creation of new jobs, thereby capitalising on the European Union’s cultural diversity and its innovative potential. At the same time, I think that we need new business models which will support these industries, by leveraging the benefits offered by the single digital market. In conclusion, I believe that this report marks a first step in the development of this sector. However, the Commission and Member States must step up their efforts to turn the cultural and creative industries into a core sector of the European economy.</p>

Against this background, ‘Youth on the Move’, a flagship initiative from the European Commission, offers concrete measures for raising the level of education and vocational training, including through mobility and facilitating access to employment. Apart from reducing the incidence of early school leaving and increasing the proportion of university graduates by 2020, I would like to highlight some aspects which may provide support to young people. The first aspect is the importance of devising more flexible educational programmes which will be compatible with holding down a job at the same time. The second aspect is the benefit of having a virtual mobility system to supplement geographical mobility. Another aspect is to encourage study grants offered to students by private companies. Support is also just as important for private youth initiatives, which can lead to job creation and, by extension, social integration.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Youth unemployment caused by the economic crisis is a considerable challenge across the EU, and so far, neither the EU nor the Member States have handled it properly. The employment situation of young people depends on general economic policy; Member States, therefore, should move towards investments and job creation. Unfortunately, the austerity measures which are also felt in Hungary and which affect, amongst other things, the education system, as well as the spending cuts affecting job creation, do not really help young people; on the contrary, their sense of isolation from society and the labour market could pose a long-term threat to the economy. The economic crisis should not be a reason for education spending cuts, because combating the impacts of the crisis requires that young people receive higher levels of education. The success and effectiveness of the ‘Youth on the Move’ initiative depends, to a large extent, on the attitude and key activities of Member States and the financial support they provide for the implementation of these programmes at a national level, which could contribute to the social integration of young people. The role played by local education institutions, as well as local and regional authorities in the area of education and mobility, is also very important, which is why I believe it is important to support the mobility of teachers and youth and education workers, since they are the ones who can motivate youth. In order to achieve these EU targets, a partnership approach should be created with local and regional authorities as well.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported this report, which reaffirms our ambitions for young people in Europe. The Europe 2020 strategy puts the education of young people at the heart of its objectives and proposes targets for 2020: a reduction of early school leaving from 15% to 10% and an increase in the percentage of those having a higher education qualification from 31% to 40%. Nonetheless, I would like to insist on one point: obstacles to young people’s mobility. Currently, it is estimated that only 4% of European students receive an Erasmus grant during their studies. This is still too little when one knows that a CV can be greatly enhanced by a year abroad, in terms of learning – especially with regard to learning foreign languages – open-mindedness and skills. Three issues can explain this figure: the fact that many students are not even aware that these opportunities for studying abroad exist, the cost of an Erasmus year for a student’s budget and the complexity of recognising achievements. In all these areas, Europe and the Member States must commit themselves, so that the Erasmus programme, which is one of the EU’s greatest successes, becomes a success for everyone.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The principal goal of the ‘Youth on the Move’ initiative is to promote youth mobility and to break down barriers that are still standing in its way. However, I do welcome the fact that it also places increased emphasis on harmonising education and labour market needs. Perhaps the gravest concern of today’s graduate youth in particular is that, following the completion of their studies, they are faced with not being able to capitalise on their knowledge on the labour market. The alarming unemployment figures of young people support this; the effects of this phenomenon have a ripple effect towards a decreased willingness to have children and a drastic delay in starting a family, thereby strengthening negative demographic processes. The problem, of course, is known both at European Union and Member State level. However, the solution is primarily in the hands of the latter, as only they can reorganise and reform the national education systems and adjust them to the new socio-economic realities. The task of the EU is to create a framework for the processes and prevent Member States from losing track of the original goal while, at the same time, encouraging and motivating them to implement reforms that are difficult in the short term but certainly profitable in the long run.</p>

      <p sl="pl">At a time of economic crisis, when some Member States are reducing investment in education and training, I am pleased that Parliament has today adopted the report on Youth on the Move.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In recent years, it is, in fact, young people who have felt the effects of the crisis most acutely. The rate of unemployment among young people in the EU has exceeded 20%, which is twice as high as the rate for adults, and in some Member States, it has reached 40%. Budget cuts are having a direct effect on young people’s prospects and opportunities for development. The knowledge and skills of young people are essential for the achievement of intelligent and sustainable development. Youth on the Move, a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy, should aim to enhance the attractiveness of higher education in Europe, raise the quality of education and increase student and worker mobility. This initiative enables young people to acquire knowledge, skills and competences which are essential for work and life. These priorities and objectives will not be fully realised and achieved if the EU does not ensure long-term financial support in its budget. Therefore, it is so important that this programme be given high subsidies, not forgetting, at the same time, how important it is to continue to promote it and maintain an appropriate information policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">This report shone the spotlight on an occupational category that is all too often neglected. What would European culture be without creative artists? While developing the creative industries economically, we must not forget those who work in this sector. As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important. Unfortunately, many of the 5 million people who make their livelihoods from the creative sector live in precarious conditions. Second and third jobs are not rare, as one job is often not enough to live on. A lack of health and pension insurance is on the agenda. Contracts are mostly uncertain, and many creative workers are scarcely able to plan more than a couple of months in advance. Moreover, a fair level of social security protection, with adequate insurance against unemployment, sickness and for old age, must be standard practice also for those working in the creative sector. I am very pleased to see that the rapporteur followed the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this regard and included it in the report. It is now time for the Commission and the Member States to remedy these social deficiencies and to promise the many creative minds of Europe that creative artists in Europe need not live as an underclass.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his fine work and beneficial cooperation on this report. I want to highlight again the great economic and cultural potential, as well as the unique nature of the creative industries. They lie in a very delicate area between mainstream business and the creation of cultural products. It is gratifying that even in the current circumstances, this sector is one of the most dynamic and innovative in Europe. One other point worth mentioning is that it offers potential for growth and provides jobs for around 5 million people in the EU. Unfortunately, my suggestion urging the European Commission and Member States to discuss the opportunities for creating specialist European and national funds, which would have provided resources for borrowing under soft terms for these industries, was rejected by a small margin during the vote in the Committee on Culture and Education. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that this idea of mine will come to fruition and will be adopted in the near future. I think that this is extremely important for the support and development of the cultural and creative industries because, as they are not quite commercial activities, they need soft financing, which banks cannot provide nowadays in the normal way for other industries.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In the European Parliament, we are calling for specific action – for the European Commission to recognise the creative sector as one of the most productive areas of the Union economy and so to treat its development as an absolute priority. To achieve this, we want primarily to increase the possibilities of financing the creative sector, as a pillar of intelligent economic growth, from the Union budget. For it is possible to create synergy between Union programmes for the support of culture, such as Culture 2007-2013, for example, with existing Union research programmes (such as the Eighth Framework Programme, which supports the EU’s technological development), or to extend the possibilities for spending money from existing funds (such as the European Social Fund, for example). We also recommend supporting the development of new and innovative financial instruments (compilations of bank guarantees, returnable deposits and intelligent loans), thanks to which it would be easier for creators or small and medium-sized businesses from the creative sector to start their enterprises. Of course, money is not everything. Among other things, we propose strengthening cooperation between the cultural and creative sectors and European universities, increasing the number of specialist training courses for young people, and improving the mobility of all creators and people of culture. To this end, we intend to create a multilingual Internet platform which would be used for the exchange of experiences between creators and, as a consequence, for the creation of a still closer network of contacts between all those for whom the development of the creative industry in Europe is important.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, there is no doubt that this report represents a step forward in the creation of new educational opportunities for young people. It advocates more research, more innovation, more EU 2020 strategy in a context that is becoming increasingly relevant. We need more education at school level, more training, but also more universities, so that we are working together with young people to ensure that the promotion of culture yields added value.</p>
      <p sl="it">Building educational success is the focus of this report, and it is also the reason why we voted in favour. Greater mobility for young people, a greater capacity to develop opportunities for work, and a labour market that must take into consideration not only young people working in a given context, but all the sectors that provide opportunities for young people to grow.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I supported the European initiative Youth on the Move, the aim of which is to reduce the proportion of students leaving education early from 15% to 10% by 2020, and to increase the proportion of people with a university education from 31% to 40%. For the purposes of comparison, 40% of the population in the US have a university education, and 50% in Japan.</p>
      <p sl="sk">At present, 14.4% of young people in Europe aged 18 to 24 years have less than higher secondary level education, and almost 21% of young people are unemployed. I also support the fact that the Youth on the Move initiative aims to ensure education that will meet the needs of the labour market. It is estimated that by 2020, the proportion of jobs requiring a high qualification will rise from 29% to 35%.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, European programmes which support young people call for unqualified support. The people who are the future of our continent are also the most defenceless, are they not? It is we who must ensure that they receive the right education, with access to the benefits of culture and, most of all, the opportunity to learn foreign languages, as well as the opportunity to make a free choice of where they would like to receive their education. Not everyone has the money and the opportunity to be able to arrange this for themselves. The good results achieved in many programmes for helping young people, such as Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci, show this to be an effective investment. The greatest support is needed by young people living in rural areas, who often do not have the financial means to begin a course of higher education and also do not have the opportunity to find work outside of agriculture in the area where they live.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I wish to say a few words about Mr Zver’s excellent Youth on the Move initiative. This is one of the success stories of EU policy. Even the Eurosceptics or those who are critical of it are of the opinion that it is because of these youth mobility programmes that a certain added value has been achieved that benefits everyone. The Bologna Process, the Copenhagen Process and other such initiatives are good examples of this.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Mr Zver’s report endorses this trend, one that has already been perceived as a welcome one, and which creates new opportunities and prerequisites for young Europeans studying in the different countries of Europe. It will be a way for us to be able genuinely to exchange best practices. I believe that in the long term, this will constitute one firm basis for economic growth in Europe, but more important than economic growth is to remember that it is via this process that people, young people, can grow as individuals and Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, I am pleased that today, we adopted the motion for a resolution entitled Youth on the Move: a framework for improving Europe’s education and training systems, because this resolution provides clear recommendations and key orientations that European Union countries could and should follow in order to improve education and training systems. Nevertheless, I would like to single out a few aspects: firstly, given that the Youth on the Move initiative aims to achieve the principal goal set in the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing the number of people leaving school without qualifications from 15% to 10%, it lacks measures and recommendations oriented towards raising teacher competences, qualifications or professional prestige. We must clearly understand that the teaching profession is the profession that creates the greatest added value for society, and must strive to ensure that teachers in European countries are the best. I very much agree with the call in the document for an all-embracing strategy to be submitted to the Commission, aimed at promoting non-formal education, and I would call for this document’s key recommendations to be directly linked to the multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="de">I want to state quite clearly that I love the language of Shakespeare, but I do think it is a pity if our young people converse in but one language. It is precisely the learning of the language of our neighbours and the learning of the smaller languages that we ought to be promoting in particular in this framework. The truth is that you only really get to know the culture of your neighbours when you start to experience day-to-day life in their language.

We must instil positive values and the right moral standards into our children from their earliest years. Education should be based on good, solid foundations and be provided by teaching staff with appropriate education and training.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must strive to achieve equal opportunities, so that all children, regardless of whether they come from urban or rural areas, or from rich or poor families, have access to early learning.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, it is very important to focus on the early years of childhood and early childhood education and care (ECEC). That is why I warmly welcomed Mrs Honeyball’s report, for which I myself was shadow rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With regard to this excellent report, I would like to make it clear that, hopefully, it is the importance of upbringing rather than education that needs to be emphasised when we are talking about small children. That is because all the essential ingredients of a person’s life are established during the first few years, and so it is probably true that if children have a secure basic upbringing, a secure living environment, they will also have the chance to succeed in the future.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We should therefore stress the importance of upbringing rather than education. There will be a time for education later on, but, as has been said, this report reviews different models that exist in Europe, and the basic premise is that we should ensure that, from early childhood, not one single young person is excluded: everyone should have an opportunity to live a good, full life.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, I would like to react to the misinformation provided by Mr Tomaševski during the debate this morning. He stated that children from the Polish minority in Lithuania are unable to study in Polish. For your information, Lithuania is home to around 200 000 Lithuanian citizens of Polish descent, and there are 62 schools where teaching is only carried out in Polish and 34 schools with Polish classes. Meanwhile, in Germany, where there are 2 million people of Polish descent, there is not one state school exclusively for Poles. It should be noted that only in Lithuania can citizens of Polish descent obtain an education in Polish from nursery to university. This is unique in the world. Lithuania is home to a subsidiary of Białystok University, the only department of a Polish university outside Poland. In a survey, 42% of representatives of national minorities in Lithuania cited insufficient knowledge of Lithuanian as a disadvantage when competing for jobs. It is strange to hear criticisms of the Lithuanian education law, which mirrors the law in Poland, and I would like to pose a rhetorical question: does Mr Tomaševski feel that national minorities are being abused in Poland too?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, childhood undoubtedly has fundamental significance for the physical, mental and social development of children. We must therefore understand that the return on investments into pre-school education is the guarantee of future growth. Apart from this, many studies have already shown that funding used in this way brings considerable economic and social advantages in the medium and long-term.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The best and most natural way to secure support of this kind is to protect the family as the basic unit of society. Parents are the first and most important teachers of their children, and thus the legal framework should not contain provisions which penalise parents for personally caring for their children, particularly in the early years. This agenda is within the exclusive competence of the Member States. It is more than desirable for the Union, through its coordinating role, to contribute towards improving the situation in the individual Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, supporters of the common fisheries policy often point out that fish do not recognise national borders. They tend to tell you this as though it is an original insight – oh really, they swim around, well who would have thought it!</p>
      <p sl="en">Yet the reality is that territorial jurisdiction and property rights are the only secure basis for conservation. If you look at the countries that have pursued successful conservation policies in fisheries – whether it is the Falkland Islands, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand – all of them have done so on the basis of giving skippers a sense of ownership so that they have an incentive to treat fisheries as a renewable resource. It is the basic wisdom of Aristotle that that which nobody owns, nobody will care for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unfortunately, the common fisheries policy defines fish stocks as a common resource to which all nations have equal access. Hence, the ecological calamity which has befallen stocks in the North Sea.</p>
      <p sl="en">One point which is particularly timely is that we have seen in recent years a migration of mackerel from common fisheries policy waters into Iceland territorial waters. That, I am afraid, makes them Icelandic property. There is no point in complaining about this. It is our bad luck and their good luck. It may happen that it comes the other way round in a few years time, then it will be our good luck. In the meantime, the best and surest way to ensure that we treat fish as a supply that is always going to be there is to recognise the ownership rights of the people who have the water under maritime law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the rising global market prices for oil are not the only cause of the crisis in the fisheries sector, as the fuels are generally already exempt from tax and as the rising global market prices affect every fisherman in the world – in the European Union and beyond. As a second point, the raising of the de minimis thresholds should be seized as an opportunity to also help fishermen to be able to work – and fish – in a more environmentally sound and sustainable way. Thirdly, simply making the fuel cheaper will not achieve this aim. Put simply, I expect the Member States, too, to produce innovative and useful solutions in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="es">Firstly, Madam President, I want to convey my support to all the people in Lorca, in the province of Murcia in Spain, to the eight people who died and their families, and to the 250 who were injured in yesterday’s earthquake.</p>
      <p sl="es">I voted in favour of this joint motion for a resolution, not having gone along with my group, due to my concern about the difficult time the sector is experiencing and which has worsened due to the oil price increase.</p>
      <p sl="es">The EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 increase of de minimis aid for companies for a period of only three years can help them in this complicated situation. In addition, I have to say that this increase does not imply any increase in the European Union budgets. Its application must also guarantee environmental and social sustainability, and should not distort competition between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, the European Fisheries Fund must continue to support this sector in order to reduce fishermen’s dependency on fossil fuels, to make its activity more efficient and provide it with innovative proposals that must give new opportunities to the maritime sector.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, I was pleased to support these recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Fishing – like farming – is a very precarious occupation. It is open to the vagaries of the weather and subject to the quota situation and, of course, the vagaries of stocks and supplies. Now, added to this, we have the sudden increase in oil prices.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Ultimately, the solution will have to come from within the European Union, with it becoming more self-sufficient in terms of more general energy supplies, obviously including renewable energies. However, I also think that we need to look at exploring areas within Europe that have not been explored before because it was not economically viable to do so. Now that is changing. I think if we could increase the supply within Europe, that would automatically bring down world prices and also, of course, make us less dependent on non-democratic regimes for our supply.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I fully agree with the demand for the assessment of the impact of all relevant bills on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to be performed systematically both at a national and at a European level, because these businesses are the real backbone of the European economy and, as such, provide more than 100 million jobs.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Current practice shows, however, that at a regional and local level, access to financial support for the initial stages of innovation and for supporting start-ups and small innovative companies is still very inadequate and patchy in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This heterogeneity is also confirmed by the finding that 75% of the overall EUR 21 billion assigned for financial support was made fully available through the intermediary banks, which was drawn on by just 50 000 out of the total of 23 million SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="en">We strongly support the main thrust of any provision such as this to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We know the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy and to the European economy. However, we do not see the case for including reference to the CCCTB in this report. It appears to me that we buy into the propaganda of whatever the flavour of the day happens to be. Currently in Germany, for example, they say they are having second thoughts about this whole CCCTB.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, as far as common corporate tax is concerned, it would be a very challenging prospect for the European Union, because its 27 Member States are all very different. Their economic structures are very different, though of course, as we are in the Single Market, it is very important to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises, which actually make up the backbone of the European economy, have fairly equal opportunities for competition.</p>
      <p sl="fi">At present, that is not the case, and in that sense it is very important that a review of SMEs is now conducted. Being from Finland, for example, I realise very clearly that Finnish companies are a very long way from the heart of the internal market and, for that reason, logistical costs – transport costs – push up the prices of products considerably. We therefore need different systems of compensation via taxation even within the European Union, but also in other ways, so that the competition situation might be fairer for everyone.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is very important that a report such as this one has been produced and that we should also aim to consider companies in remote areas in the north, for them to be able to compete on an equal footing with other European companies.</p>

      <p sl="ga">The point I want to mention is that it was notable that it took an oral amendment to raise the issue of counterfeiting with regard to this individual proposal. That is unfortunate, because counterfeited goods are doing huge damage to businesses right across Europe and this has not been highlighted or tackled enough.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Many of these goods come from third countries and are facilitated by the governments of those countries, which give safe haven to goods coming to Europe.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, more rapid development, efficiency, including cost-efficiency, and greater competitiveness are the best means for tackling economic problems. To achieve these objectives, we need to work together for innovation. Something which is very important, here, is the emphasis given to citizens’ creativeness, for example, by making room for employees to suggest how to improve work processes. Another factor which drives innovation is consumption, and a specific example of the way in which citizens’ creativeness can be combined with the desire to use modern technologies are the iPhone applications being developed by European consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Strengthening the knowledge base by bringing together businesses, knowledge institutions and the citizens themselves is an important factor in achieving the goals of the Innovation Union. In this respect, it will be essential to achieve the full engagement of public and local authorities. A fundamental objective of innovation is to maintain a high level of prosperity in Europe. I hope the joining of forces which has been proposed will contribute to support for the process of innovation and help bring about economic stabilisation. Hence, I support the report.</p>

I would like, however, to give my backing, in particular, to those speakers who stressed that innovation and research should and must take place in the agricultural sector, too. Agriculture is no ‘old economy’ – it is modern and it is also an environment where activity, research and innovation take place.</p>
      <p sl="de">European agriculture faces at least three major challenges; namely, ensuring the feeding of the population, sustaining the environment and producing energy. These at times widely divergent aims require systematic scientific permeation both now and in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I endorsed the report on Innovation Union. Innovation is, of course, crucial for Europe’s development. However, in my opinion, something which is absolutely fundamental is support for innovation in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in particular, especially in the European Union’s new Member States, which, in this respect, are some way behind. Indeed, it is events in this sector – as would appear from numerous analyses – which will decide if the European economy of the future will be competitive in relation to other major world economies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be remembered – as is shown by research conducted by accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young – that three quarters of applications submitted by small enterprises in Europe for research subsidies and the purchase of new technologies are, unfortunately, rejected by the banks. Funding is a serious problem, so we should persuade individual Member States to support small and medium-sized enterprises in this area. Without this support, they will not cope with the growing competition in the world economy.</p>

Therefore, to secure the sustainable development of Europe, we must allocate increased funds to the development of innovation and to research projects in the EU’s new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should encourage governments that as well as increasing budgetary means allocated each year to research, they should establish a percentage of their budget as a minimum threshold which must be used on research and development-type projects. However, the amount spent on research and development should not in any way reduce future budgetary plans for the European Union’s current priorities, such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy, because they are fulfilling their role well.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, despite the fact that innovations are so incredibly important for economic and social development in Europe, up to now, the EU has not had any collective regulations on innovations. The fact that this proposal has been tabled by the Commission and Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn is therefore extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When we now lay down the rules that are to apply, we must try very hard, in this document and in the Innovation Union, to simplify and remove any unnecessary bureaucracy. Simplifying the rules is extremely important, because every researcher, every industry and every small business brings this up as the greatest barrier to using EU funds and working together in a focused way to improve the situation for innovations in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We also need to ensure that we have much more effective management. We need to focus on the really big projects instead of spreading the money over a large number of different areas, as we do in all other contexts.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the everyday life of the domestic worker is often uncertain, undervalued and unofficial. They are treated unequally, unfairly and poorly.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In Europe, domestic workers are generally migrant workers, a large number of whom have arrived in the country illegally. They no not appear in any registers, they are at risk of being exploited, and they are at the mercy of their employers. The ILO convention on domestic workers and the common rules that would apply are a primary means of ensuring that the human rights of domestic workers and their employment and social rights are respected, supervised and developed.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It would be naïve to say that there were no illegal domestic workers in Europe. This is a kind of modern day slavery. These workers, who are frequently women, are the most vulnerable of all. They do not dare to complain about the fact that they are treated badly or about violence or sexual exploitation. The exploitation does not just apply to those from outside the EU: we are also exploiting our own citizens.

First of all, I agree with those who say that those employed in this sector – and they are mostly women, of course – are entitled to fair pay and fair social services. I also very much agree with those who say that, in this sector in particular, many unbelievable things happen and there is much injustice.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do ask, however, that attention be paid to red tape when implementing justified demands. In Germany, for example, the reality is that I, as someone who is covered by this legislation given my employment of domestic staff, need to call on the assistance of a tax advisor quite simply because there is so much red tape and the statutory stipulations are so complicated. This takes its toll on the nerves, takes time and costs money. Those who eschew the red tape mostly then pay their staff cash, thereby contributing – sometimes inadvertently – to illegal employment.

The first is that it is right that it must be our aim to reduce the use of antibiotics in livestock production, in particular. ‘As little as possible’ should be the cornerstone of our action in this regard. My second point is that we need an analysis of the status quo , in other words, an analysis of the data covering what is actually happening on the ground in the Member States of the European Union. Obviously, all Member States need to take part in such an analysis. My third point is that we need further scientific studies in order to analyse the dangers and also in order to be able to counter those dangers effectively.

      <p sl="fi">In all its cultural diversity, the EU is a coherent yet varied community of values. In international policy, culture is of major importance. It is a human right and each person and nation has a right to enjoy it. Culture is also linked to human well-being and coping generally.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Cultural policy also allows the EU to connect with other countries with which no other form of partnership has been agreed on. Support for the cultural dimension in those countries in North Africa which are now building a new, more democratic society is also especially important. Bilateral development and trade agreements should always require not just elements of social responsibility but also cultural elements. There should even be cultural experts associated with the European External Action Service, so that culture can be made part of the EU’s foreign policy in a way that is more coherent and systematic.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the cultural heritage of European countries is, in itself, something of value. Although there are many cultural differences between them, the Member States have already made a good name for themselves in the world, one which attracts the citizens of other countries who would like to draw on these cultural resources. The European Union’s political and economic position can be strengthened by promoting the Union’s identity and cultural value.</p>
      <p sl="pl">An important role in the area of culture is being played by new technologies, which also enable people to exercise fundamental human rights. Particularly in countries which are in the grip of censorship, the activity of citizens and access to information are maintained by the instrumentality of the Internet. The Union must, therefore, support freedom of the Internet in the world arena and make significant contributions to the development of culture and the awareness of people in closed societies. In addition, the young generation needs a consistent strategy on mobility for increasing development in the area of science and culture. I support measures for cultural diplomacy, which can also be helped by the work of parliamentary delegations. This is why I endorsed the report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the declarations and remarks contained in the report are exceptionally valuable and appropriate. In particular, I would like to refer, here, to the statements which point out that the European Union is obliged to take action throughout the world to promote respect for freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of access to audiovisual media. Also very appropriate is the call for the European Commission to promote Internet freedom globally, in view of the threats to this freedom of which we increasingly read and hear.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Although I am pleased to note that we are calling for values which we Europeans consider to be fundamental, I also admit that it was with a certain sadness that I endorsed this report. I am aware that we sometimes call for these fundamental values to be upheld in other parts of the world, but forget that they are also being violated in some of the European Union’s Member States. An example of this is what is happening in Poland in relation to journalists who are critical of the government. They are being removed from public media en masse , and representatives of the government are trying to close down the independent, privately-owned daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita , which is the second largest quality daily in Poland and which is critical, incidentally, of the government’s position. While we are dealing with the matters raised in the report, this, too, should be opposed.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, it is very important that the cultural dimension is also included in the debate on foreign policy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I think that we have reached this conclusion because, with the current turmoil in the Middle East, it has been realised that we had forgotten all about the cultural dimension for decades: for example, in the European Union’s relations with Syria. Since 1963, Syria has been under emergency law, which has allowed the execution of people without trial, but few European delegations, the EU delegation for example, have raised the issue. Trade and finance have taken priority over human rights.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Just as Mr Repo said just now, human rights are also a crucial part of the cultural dimension when we speak of the European Union. This is important to remember.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I endorsed the interesting report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions. How can one not be in favour of these statements on action which the EU is taking throughout the world to promote respect for freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of access to audiovisual media and so on?</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I have the impression that we care too much about the situation outside the Union and care too little about standards inside the Union, for example, in Poland, because it is in Poland that after the current governing coalition gained control of the public media, it began to dismiss large numbers of journalists and close down their programmes, all of which had one thing in common – criticism of the current situation. So, for example, such people as Jacek Sobala, Anita Gargas, Jacek Karnowski and Wojciech Leszczyński have lost their jobs. Journalists such as Joanna Lichocka, Tomasz Sakiewicz, Rafał Ziemkiewicz, Jan Pospieszalski, Grzegorz Górny, Tomasz Terlikowski, Bronisław Wildstein and Wojciech Cejrowski have lost their programmes – and these are just some examples among many others. The gagging of free speech in Poland is a disgrace to the entire European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, first of all, concerning Mrs Sanchez-Schmid’s report, I wish to say that it is extremely important that we in the European Union acknowledge the impact that creative industry and culture also has on economic growth in the European Union. It is very significant: 2.6% of EU GDP comes specifically from creative industries, and they employ 3.1% of the EU’s workforce. You could therefore say that over the last few years, even decades, it has been a growth industry, and it will continue to be one in the future too.</p>
      <p sl="fi">When we speak of the cultural dimension, it is also important to remember that it is something other than just economic growth. It is also growth for humanity, and this should never be forgotten when speaking about culture. In this respect, the impact of culture should not be measured in terms of growth in GDP: we must also appreciate the fact that a person does not just generate growth in GDP by participating in the rat race, but by living a unique life of human values, and it is to that end that we must create the right conditions and circumstances. We, as members of the European Union, should remember this because, all too often, the Union presents us with a narrow picture of itself, as little more than a system of bodies of economic cooperation, and we forget the wider picture.</p>
      <p sl="fi">With respect to Sarajevo as Capital of Culture for 2014, I would like to say that I hope that this project goes ahead. For us on the Committee on Culture and Education, it has been an idea and project that we have all shared, as 2014 will mark the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, which began with an incident in that very city. It symbolises the developments that have taken place in Europe. We want to show that 2014 is the year that would mark the start of a long period of peace, or would continue the long period of peace that has already started. The Baltic countries should also, however, participate more robustly in this peace and stability development. It would certainly have greater significance for a wider Europe.</p>

The ‘Youth on the Move’ initiative also focuses on promoting learning mobility, with it also being essential to ensure that the education they are receiving is compatible with the needs of the labour market to equip them with the skills and knowledge they will need. Mobility is important to learn about other cultures, but also to better understand one’s own. Less than one third of the EU’s population has a higher education degree, compared with over 40% in the United States and over 50% in Japan, so Europe must increase these numbers in order to be able to make itself more competitive in an ever-increasing global economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">Recent years have seen the European Union become increasingly focused on creating a knowledge-based society that is able to compete with all other economies on a global scale. With its Youth on the Move initiative, the EU 2020 strategy has given young people a key role, with the aim of meeting the five main targets by 2020: employment, research and innovation, climate and energy, education and reduction of poverty. These targets are ambitious, given that the current situation is so unstable and forces young people to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty, far removed from the encouraging prospect of a stable job in the future and of their place in society. It will be impossible to consolidate the spirit of European citizenship, and to unlock the potential that young people represent, unless the tools available offer the resources that are needed for things to work well.</p>
      <p sl="it">Member States should refrain from adopting austerity measures that involve making cuts to the educational system and employment. Instead, they should focus on establishing platforms that involve both employers and workers, universities, businesses and local and regional organisations, in order to offer opportunities in the educational and professional training sector, and to ensure that there is good mobility and that qualifications are recognised.</p>

Young people have suffered particularly badly from the crisis, and the average youth unemployment rate in the EU is over 20%, twice the average for adults, while in some Member States, it exceeds 40%. Owing to the economic crisis, Member States are cutting investment in education and training, directly affecting young people’s future prospects and the future of the EU. Investing in education is, without doubt, essential for sustainable growth and development and, even in times of economic crisis, financing youth programmes and education should not be regarded as a cost to be met now, but rather as an investment in the future of Europe. I feel that the Youth on the Move initiative provided for in the Europe 2020 strategy can contribute towards strengthening the existing education, mobility and employment programmes for young people and encouraging Member States to achieve the targets of the EU 2020 strategy.</p>

These problems require harmonised action at EU level so that young people are better prepared for the labour market. We need policies which will cover the steps that young people have to take when making the transition from education to employment. I feel that it is vital for young people and the various youth organisations to be involved in the decision-making process. This will help reinforce their sense of belonging and of making an active contribution to a youth strategy. The key objective of the ‘Youth on the Move’ initiative must be to increase European cohesion. The EU must deploy its own financial instruments to help young people, by using the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Youth on the Move initiative is part of the Europe 2020 strategy. It introduces 28 measures aimed at better adapting teaching and training systems to the needs of young people, encouraging them to make use of EU aid to study or take part in a training course in another country. This initiative aims to increase youth mobility by aiming to ensure that all young people in the EU have the opportunity to study abroad by 2020.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This report, which merited my vote in favour, warns of a series of situations worthy of particular attention. In order to avoid this initiative existing simply as a concept, it is necessary that the Member States commit to it both in terms of financial support and its implementation, and it is also important that an EU budget is adopted for it.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is essential to overcome practical barriers and obstacles to mobility, and additional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that people with disabilities are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else.

      <p sl="fr">Although the European youth unemployment figures are extremely worrying – in January 2011, the unemployment rate among under-25s in the EU rose to 20.6% – the report on the 2020 strategy’s flagship initiative, ‘Youth on the Move’, calls on Member States to increase their investment in education, training and mobility. Policies relating to young people, whether they concern early, continuing or vocational education and training, must be seen as an investment, not a cost. Putting the emphasis on human capital is essential for the future of our European societies. Highlighting the synergies between the different agents involved, developing young people’s independence, taking action to stop young people leaving education early, reasserting the importance of vocational training and apprenticeships, adopting a binding European quality framework for training schemes: these are the kinds of good ideas that it is important for us to air now at national level. This is because the success of the 2020 strategy will depend on the initiative and the political will of the States responsible for implementing it, as these policies largely remain within national competences.</p>

      <p sl="it">Youth on the Move (YoM) is one of the flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy for the promotion of smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. YoM outlines key courses of action for increasing young people’s education and training by means of mobility, and thus for facilitating their entry into the labour market. According to recent figures, 14.4% of young Europeans aged between 18 and 24 years dropped out of school before completing their secondary education, and less than one third of the European Union’s population have a higher education qualification, compared with around 40% in the United States and 50% in Japan. It is essential that young people are able to develop the skills and abilities that will enable them to enter the labour market and to make an active contribution to the Union’s growth</p>

The positive points in the report include frequent references to the importance of access to education, opposition to cutbacks in spending on education and training and a call for increased funding for them so that, all other things being equal, everyone will be able to take part in this programme. It also gives young people from neighbouring countries the opportunity to take part and highlights the need to oppose discrimination in the workplace. Huge importance is attached to a pragmatic system of internships which will allow everyone to earn a decent wage and access social insurance, so that they do not replace real jobs. However, as there are certain points in the report which are typical of the Bologna policy on education, to which I am opposed, in that it refers to the need to formulate programmes in keeping with the ‘needs of the market’, which I consider may jeopardise the nature of the programme, I abstained.</p>

      <p sl="it">The ‘Youth on the Move’ initiative is an important point of reference for young European citizens.

The contribution of ‘Youth on the Move’ to the debate on the definition of a European cultural model is no less important. Cooperation between the various institutes and learning in the various disciplines, which are taught differently in the various countries depending also on the political awareness of the ruling classes, also represents a key contribution to the definition of a European identity. We must ensure that through our young people, these identities are truly European and not allow the only educational model for our young people in the future to be the American one, although this has, of course, been an important point of reference until now. The European Union has all the tools it requires for offering the world its values and ideas of how it wants and will want its children to grow up.</p>

The ‘Youth on the Move’ programme included in the Europe 2020 strategy is therefore an important collection of programmes to support the youngest people, with objectives that are ambitious but very clear, in which I see myself and in which I hope the people at whom it is aimed will participate significantly. This initiative advocates the need to give more young people improved access to the labour market, which is a very relevant goal given the level that youth unemployment is reaching in a number of Member States. I would also stress the attention given to the importance of mobility of young Europeans, during both their education and their working lives. This education in a variety of cultures and places will provide an education that is more complete and richer, whilst contributing to building a real feeling of ‘European ownership’, which will help to cement the concept of European citizenship included in the Treaties.

      <p sl="fr">Student mobility programmes such as Erasmus, Erasmus Mundus and Comenius are attracting more and more candidates. However, there are still practical obstacles to mobility, especially for obtaining visas and medical papers in different languages, for transferring grants abroad, and for the recognition of qualifications gained in another Member State. In 2004, when the Erasmus Mundus exchange programme was launched, with the help of a large majority in this Parliament, I got the European Commission to agree to take the necessary measures to ensure quality in this programme. A ‘European Quality Charter for Mobility’ was even created. Only, seven years later, the same obstacles are still there. That is why the European Parliament has wanted to reiterate how much increased investments in education and training are needed. The opening of European mobility programmes to all young people, irrespective of their course or social background, is crucial in order to give them better access to the labour market. It is time for the Member States to genuinely commit in order to guarantee high quality training for all young Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This makes its contradictions more obvious: by endorsing the objectives of the so-called Europe 2020 strategy, it ends up advocating the path that leads to the problems it identifies, of unsecure jobs and unemployment for young people.

      <p sl="pt">It is not enough to express interesting principles if you do not take reality into account. A quality education from the earliest years of life is necessary to ensure the development of the human being and of societies. However, funds for quality public education are increasingly short, and students are faced with a lack of grants, unemployed families and dropping out of their studies, as is happening in Portugal with the restrictive policies that are being practised.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reality, then, is a sharp divestment in these areas. In the name of the crisis, there is a retreat of the state that, here too, threatens its social role and has the result of exacerbating inequalities in access to education, to knowledge and to culture. The result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequalities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The reality in Member States such as Portugal is the closure of thousands of schools, increasing youth unemployment and reducing the job security of thousands of teachers, as well as the chronic underfunding of the state higher education system and the increased cost of attending it. The reality is that budgets for culture are being slashed to penury levels.</p>

Supporting young people by encouraging dialogue between the European institutions and youth organisations is a good start, but it cannot be considered the ultimate aim. We should be able to listen to them and to give them credibility and trust. Only this way will we be able to create a Europe which the new generations will see as an opportunity and not as a millstone.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted for the Zver report. In order for the EU 2020 ‘Youth on the Move’ (YoM) flagship initiative to be successful, EU Institutions must create a pragmatic, comprehensive and wide-ranging policy supported by all Member States which focuses on connecting the areas of vocational education, professional qualifications, lifelong learning and apprenticeship to the labour market so as to ensure that each Member State will truly take ownership of the EU’s education system. YoM is about making the transition from learning and training into the labour market easier for Europe’s young people. One of the goals of this policy initiative is to reduce the number of early school leavers and increase the proportion of people with tertiary education qualifications, the reason being that early school leaving runs counter to the dynamics and needs of the labour market and is also in direct conflict with Europe’s economic and social sustainability in general. Consequently, all labour market players, including those from the professional sectors, businesses, trade unions, ministries and public employment services, should engage in a structured dialogue on how to guarantee professional integration of the young, promote formal/informal training and ultimately develop an education system in the EU which is able to provide career security for our young people.</p>

      <p sl="de">This report once again shows how important it is for European development to promote the mobility of our young people in all fields. The alignment of study programmes and corresponding mutual recognition must be achieved in all areas of training and education, in particular, in manual trades, where there is a lot of ground to make up.</p>
      <p sl="de">There should also be more checking by the competent educational authorities in the countries concerned of whether additional barriers need to be removed where these have been built up at the administration level or at the level of the trade associations.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mobility on the part of apprentices also leads to better recognition of many trades and impedes social dumping, as there is a progressive scale that means that, for the same level of training, the same pay is awarded.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Popular common sense says that ‘travel broadens the mind’. It is from this perspective that I support the idea, defended in the Zver report, that the funding of young people’s education and mobility is an investment in Europe’s future, not an additional burden on the budget, this despite the current difficult economic situation. What is more, someone’s social background or financial situation should not restrict their accessing the opportunities of travelling abroad. Similarly, disability should not be an obstacle either, and that is why additional funding should be set aside for young people with disabilities. Finally, legally binding rights should be established in order to prevent the casual jobs and exploitation to which young trainees could fall victim.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because it recognises that it is essential to overcome practical obstacles and barriers to mobility and further promote recognition of time spent abroad and of qualifications from other EU countries. Moreover, it acknowledges that people with disabilities face even more barriers to mobility than those who are not disabled and additional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure they are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else. Furthermore, students with families (e.g. with children) should also be afforded additional support to overcome the unique challenges they will face in participating in educational mobility. Quality mobility is key to achieving intercultural learning, personal development and multilingualism for young people. The focus is on employment as an end result and, indeed, employment is a problem of education, but also of youth participation and active citizenship. Therefore, the existing programmes should continue to focus on active citizenship and the development of key competences, non-formal education and the promotion of European civil society. In order to avoid this new strategy from simply existing as a concept, it is essential that the Member States commit to it both in terms of financial support and its national implementation in their respective countries, and that an EU budget is adopted for it. Member States should see this as a long-term investment, not only in young people’s education, but in the future prosperity of their individual countries and of the EU as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="it">In a Europe that looks to the future, thinking about young people must be a priority. Allowing them to follow the most suitable educational pathway, to make it easy for them to learn foreign languages, to approach the world of work equipped with the appropriate skills, or perhaps to enter a new educational or working environment, means building a future for all the countries of the European Union through the energies of university students and young workers, who come together in the same economic and cultural melting pot. Today, more than ever, I believe in one Europe – a hotbed of ideas and projects – which is why I voted in favour of the report by Mr Zver. In terms of the EU 2020 strategy, creating a network of knowledge and opportunities, not just for young people but also for teachers and for all those who work in education and training, means supplying oxygen to those energies that we must unleash, using the mobility of our young people, who must learn to live in the Europe of the future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of Milan Zver’s report ‘Youth on the Move – a framework for improving Europe’s education and training systems’. Throughout this report, I think that it is important to support the various programmes that have been introduced at European level to facilitate youth mobility, which are beneficial both in terms of acquiring new knowledge and competences and in terms of developing a genuine European citizenship. At European level, it is important that, beyond 2013, we increase the credits allocated to European mobility programmes, such as Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci, and make them permanent so more young people can benefit from them – not just students, but also trainees, young professionals and young farmers. I also think that it is necessary to move towards greater recognition of qualifications obtained through all the various types of apprenticeship, non-formal or informal, given the competences that can be acquired in this way. Finally, I want to stress that one of the key ways of combating youth unemployment is to keep adapting educational and vocational training systems to the constantly evolving needs of the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The question of education and training systems is currently taking on a completely different and a new significance than was the case, for example, a decade or more ago. In different parts of Europe, we are faced with levels of education which are not the same, so the need to improve the situation in this area seems beyond question. It is important that young people have the chance to play an active role in the world of work, and also in civil society in its broadest sense. I myself am strongly involved in and support work related both to Youth in Action and the European Voluntary Service, which is one of the five operational actions of ‘Youth in Action’. Therefore, I think it is important for the European Parliament to be able to continue to support similar measures.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the present time, we must not forget young people. They should be given the chance to develop and they should be helped, so that they can acquire new skills in an economy which is becoming increasingly international. Youth on the Move is not only an opportunity for young people to become active and to get into work, but is, above all, a way for them to overcome their own limitations and weaknesses, and is a chance to develop.

Youth on the Move (YoM) is one of seven flagship initiatives contained in the Commission’s Europe 2020 strategy to promote smart, sustainable and inclusive economic growth. YoM comprises 28 key actions and concrete measures to increase the education and training of young people through mobility and ease their transition from education into the labour market. This is particularly important today as young people, being one of the social groups hit hardest by the global financial crisis and simultaneously having had the smallest role in causing it, must be supported in entering the labour market in order to secure their own futures, as well as to bolster the economy.

      <p sl="pt">In the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, young people’s knowledge and skills are essential if the objectives of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth are to be achieved. As such, youth has a key role to play in achieving the five EU headline targets for 2020: employment, research and innovation, climate and energy, education, and the fight against poverty. The ‘Youth on the Move’ flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy aims to enhance the attractiveness of higher education in Europe, the overall quality of all levels of education and training and student and worker mobility through the more effective use of existing European programmes. It is therefore essential to vote for this initiative, so that in the future, we will have young people who are increasingly qualified and prepared to realise the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Young people are, unfortunately, one of the social groups worst hit by the global financial crisis and should be given assistance to enter the labour market and to be able to shape their own future and support the economy. Education and training are key factors for greater prosperity and greater social cohesion in Europe. Student mobility is clearly a central component of the Europe 2020 strategy. It offers many opportunities for students’ intellectual emancipation, for combating early school leaving, unemployment and poverty, as well as for the development of international cooperation in higher education but also in vocational education and training.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, student mobility is one of the major challenges of European integration. Nonetheless, this mobility should take place with financial resources that measure up to ambitions and with the removal of the practical obstacles to this mobility.</p>

      <p sl="de">The effects of the global economic crisis were drastic for young people, in particular, right around the world, but also within the EU. Youth unemployment within the EU has reached a high of 21%. This is compounded by the fact that 15% of these young people dropped out of school and thus lack any qualifications for the labour market. The EU has a target of reducing this rate to 10% by 2020 and increasing the proportion of people with a qualification from a university or technical college from 31% to 40%. In order to be able to achieve these targets, there must be EU-wide recognition of education and training courses and qualifications. This is also the only way that greater mobility of our young people can be achieved, something which is also intended to help them become acquainted with new cultures and societies so that they also have the option of making a success of themselves beyond their home country in years to come. For that reason, barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified, while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted.</p>
      <p sl="de">I abstained in the vote, as I believe that there has been no discussion of how to bring about mutual recognition of qualifications obtained through qualitatively differing methods of education and training.

The basis for this is the mutual recognition of qualifications and courses of education and training. I abstained from the vote on this report as it fails to propose any tangible solutions to the issue of how mutual recognition is to take place where, of course, in many fields, there are qualitatively highly differing methods of education and training.</p>

      <p sl="lt">European Union Member States are facing a high rate of youth unemployment. In some countries, it is even touching 21%. That is double the average unemployment rate for adults.

I agree with the report’s provision that it is very important to focus on the creation of new programmes that would allow young people to combine work with studies. This is crucial for students who are seeking an education, but who have to support themselves financially. One of the programme’s key objectives is to reduce the number of people leaving school early, which increases the risk of future exclusion from both employment and society. We must increase support for people with disabilities and young people with children, so that they can participate in mobility programmes and take advantage of this opportunity to strike a study-work-life balance. Access to mobility programmes should be possible not only for university students, but also for young people with a low level of qualifications and school pupils. It is also vital for young people to gain more practical knowledge and experience through high quality compulsory traineeships.</p>

However, this initiative needs to be combined with the report entitled ‘An EU strategy for Youth’, which was adopted by the European Parliament in 2010 and which seeks to set out a new, strong, European strategy for the next ten years, so that, when it comes to youth issues, Europe can develop a single policy framework. Moreover, in order to ensure that it does not remain a simple pronouncement, the responsibility generally lies with the Member States and it is a pity that the recent national reform programmes do not tally with the objectives set in the EU 2020 strategy, despite the fact that we all recognise that investment in research and education is a long-term investment with a good return which clearly reaches forward into the future prosperity of European citizens.</p>

It aims, through concrete measures, to promote the education and training of young people through mobility, and through facilitating their transition from education to the labour market. This is a very current issue given that young people, as one of the social groups most affected by the global financial crisis and one of the groups least involved in causing this situation, must be supported in terms of labour market access in order to safeguard their future and to boost the economy.

Part of the EU 2020 strategy states that ‘by 2020, all young people in Europe must have the possibility to spend a part of their educational pathway in other Member States’. The current economic crisis has badly affected young people, and youth unemployment rates in the EU are twice the average for adults. This is one of the most difficult challenges facing Europe and it is vital that Member States do not respond by cutting investment in education. We need to ensure that our young people have opportunities to learn and to move abroad to continue their learning if they wish, as investing in education today will better equip the EU to face challenges in the future.</p>

While we need to act in order to encourage the take-up of higher education by the greatest number and actively fight against early school leaving – only 31% of Europeans have a university degree, compared to 40% in the United States and 50% in Japan – we also need to make sure graduates are employable.

For these reasons, we should make schools and businesses more aware of the need to create networks, improving young people’s practical knowledge by means of apprenticeships.

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on improving Europe’s education and training systems. I am in favour of extending the operation of all educational programmes for young people. Besides Youth on the Move, funding and political support should be given to programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig, Youth in Action and Marie Curie. These programmes have achieved great success in the Union. They involve a huge number of young people from various backgrounds (the number of Polish students who went abroad on an Erasmus grant between 1998 and 2010 was 93 807) and they contribute to the development of young people’s potential and the creation of a strong European civil society. They are very efficient programmes, where the cost for a single participant is very low but the funds are used by a high number of people. Promoting the mobility of young people requires practical barriers to be overcome.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Around one third of the students who have participated in the Erasmus programme have experienced difficulties arising from uncertainties over the system of education in other countries and the lack of correspondence and continuity between the subjects of study in the home country and abroad. The recognition of time spent abroad and of qualifications from other EU Member States should be promoted. Other matters which also need to be resolved include difficulties with obtaining visas, medical papers being in various languages and the portability of scholarships when going abroad. People with disabilities face even more barriers to mobility than those who are not disabled.

      <p sl="lt">Creating a secure future for our young people is a subject close to my heart. Sadly, the prospects for young people in Lithuania today are rather bleak. In Lithuania, youth unemployment stands at 34%, almost 14% higher than the EU average. According to EU statistics, there are only two EU Member States where youth unemployment rates are higher than in Lithuania. Even those young Lithuanians who manage to find work are often forced to accept unfavourable employment contracts. We must make more effort to implement three key priorities: firstly, to promote entrepreneurship; secondly, to improve youth employability by adapting education to the needs of the labour market; and thirdly, to give young people an opportunity to play a more active role in society. The Youth on the Move initiative is one of the platforms which may help to promote youth employment. Work and study abroad may be beneficial to Lithuania’s young people and our country. However, it is much more important to give our young people a European future in Lithuania. It is possible to ensure this by developing contacts between young people and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This would promote the need for young people among SME employers and would encourage young people to work for SMEs.</p>

The Treaty of Lisbon has broadened the EU’s remit in the area of youth. In this respect, the European Parliament had a duty to reaffirm its support for this policy. Indeed, European identity only has meaning if it is endorsed by our young fellow citizens. Europe must take on this responsibility by proposing a concerted strategy in the areas of training and employment. I welcome the ambition of this report, which sets at 2% of GDP the investment in higher education. At a time when the European labour market has been affected by a major economic crisis, training must be our priority so that we are able to offer future prospects to young people and make accessing employment easier for them. The development of European exchanges (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci) will also be beneficial for young people, since these programmes offer real added value on a professional and personal level. Learning a new language and discovering another culture are both assets that should be accessible to all.</p>

There is a clear variation between Member States in terms of the quality and supply of their provision, rates of enrolment, approach to services, governance of services, and so on. For this reason, a ‘one size fits all’ approach at EU level to early childhood education and care (ECEC) services is not suitable and would be difficult to implement. However, the development of a common framework of shared goals and values, including shared entitlements and structures, is more than recommended. The period from birth to the age of three is critical for children’s brain development, physical and cognitive development, and for language acquisition. Furthermore, these early years lay the foundations for children’s lifelong learning. Poor families are less likely to use ECEC services, especially in privatised markets, compared with other groups. This is worrying, given that disadvantaged children are those who have been shown to benefit most from access to services of this kind.</p>

By giving children the ability to realise their potential, quality education and care structures can contribute significantly to achieving two of the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing early school drop-out rates below 10% and lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Both the submitted reports and the debate so far consider culture and education from a variety of perspectives. I consider the development of creativity right from birth to be a very important aspect. The report by Mrs Honeyball points out that, from many perspectives, it is best to make a start with education in the early years. According to the human rights documents currently in force in Europe, children are fully and actively engaged citizens with their own rights. They have enormous creative potential. The period from birth to the age of three has a fundamental effect on the development of thinking, and on physical and cognitive development. The foundations for lifelong learning, which play an important role in achieving the Lisbon targets, are also laid in this early period. Poor families, often Roma, usually have worse access to services in the area of early childhood education and care. It is all the more sad for the fact that children from disadvantaged families should benefit the most from the opportunity to use these services.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We must ensure that education and care are available to all families and children, regardless of their origin or the financial situation of the parents. I very much dislike resorting to pragmatic, financial arguments in questions of human rights, and in matters that should be obvious and as independent as possible of the economic situation. However, it must be said that a decision not to invest in this area will actually give rise to costs that may not be immediately noticeable.</p>

Fathers and mothers are thus ‘equal partners in early childhood education and care’. Did I read ‘partners’? Is it not their responsibility, first and foremost, to educate their own children? However it is true that, at paragraph 16, the rapporteur is calling for investment in parental education programmes. From the outset, parents are thus seen as incapable, irresponsible and childish. This impression is confirmed by paragraph 27, which stresses that, in the absence of adequate services for early childhood, our young children run the risk of falling into criminality and antisocial behaviour.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document, because the early years of childhood (pre-school) are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development and language acquisition, and also lay the foundations for lifelong learning. It is therefore recommended that Member States consider introducing a compulsory year of nursery schooling before the start of schooling proper. The introduction and retention of innovative pedagogical models for language teaching is encouraged, particularly multilingual crèches and nursery schools which meet the objective set in Barcelona in 2002, which includes the learning of regional, minority and neighbouring languages. In an unstable economic climate, we must not neglect to invest substantially in early childhood education and care (ECEC) services. I feel that the Member States should devote appropriate resources to ECEC services. Quality early years education can help reduce early school leaving, combat educational disadvantages faced by children from disadvantaged social and cultural groups and reduce the resulting social inequalities, all of which affect society as a whole.

While it is vital to give due attention to the link between ECEC services and equality of opportunities for women, these targets are clearly problematic, and outmoded, since they fail to take into account many of the crucial qualitative aspects of a strong early education policy.

      <p sl="cs">The early years period of childhood deserves great attention and a careful approach in terms of the external environment. We must always remember that this is a unique and unrepeatable period of development, which forms the personality of the individual.

Adults should be a role model, thus helping children to acquire different types of knowledge and ability. It is the period of development of the personality, when the learning process is, so to speak, unforced and natural, and the surrounding world is noticed, accepted and absorbed to the greatest possible extent.

There is also an economic rationale behind this, given the rise in the number of women on the labour market. It is vital for us to involve the minority population in early years education programmes, especially the Roma population, which is often disadvantaged. We must also ensure that a sufficient number of childcare places are available so as to avoid long waiting times for enrolling children in this kind of institution. We must not overlook either the qualifications of the staff working with young children, who have a crucial impact on the quality of education provided.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The learning undertaken by children during early childhood is the foundation of the success of their lifelong learning. This learning sharpens the child’s intelligence, stimulates his or her natural curiosity and develops his or her motor skills, puts a premium on manual work and is good for mental health. It socialises the child, develops his or her mother tongue and accustoms him or her to the sounds of a foreign language. It leads him or her to the rudiments of reading and of arithmetic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, early childhood education and care takes on different forms in the various countries of the European Union, depending on the country’s interpretation of childhood. Early childhood education and care generally receives less attention and investment than the other education levels. All parents and children should be able to use education and care services, regardless of family origin or financial situation. Parents should, for their part, be the full partners of these services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The pre-school period being the most important for the child’s emotional and social development, those working with these children should have the required qualifications. In all cases, the prime concern must be to consider the higher needs and interests of the child.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Early childhood is unquestionably of fundamental importance to the physical, mental and social development of children, and we must therefore understand that the return on investment in pre-school education is the guarantee of future growth. Apart from this, many studies have already shown that funding used in this way brings considerable economic and social advantages in the medium and long-term.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The best and most natural way to secure support of this kind is to protect the family as the basic unit of society. Parents are the first and most important teachers of their children, and thus the legal framework should not contain provisions which penalise families for personally caring for their children, particularly in the early years. Although this agenda is within the exclusive competence of Member States, it is more than desirable for the Union, through its coordinating role, to contribute towards improving the situation in the Member States. For the reasons mentioned, I support the position of the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="de">The motion for a resolution by the UK socialist MEP, Mary Honeyball, seeks to reduce the role of the mother and father of a child to that of equal partners in the State education system. Verbatim, the report states (in paragraph 14) that ‘[The European Parliament] stresses that parents, both mothers and fathers, are equal partners in ECEC [early childhood education and care]; (…)’. This wording expresses deep mistrust of the family and the globally recognised right of parents to care for and bring up their children. This is in direct contrast to the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which states that ‘The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them’ (Article 6(2)). This report is a manifestation of the EU’s anti-family agenda and seeks to meddle in the social competences of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, the motion recommends the introduction of a compulsory year of nursery schooling before the start of schooling proper, as well as developing and improving early years educational establishments In so doing, the report confirms the EU’s ‘Barcelona objectives’ which, as once upon a time in the Soviet Union, provide quotas for the state takeover of children’s upbringing. The well-being of the child is not central to this motion. The freedom of choice of parents in relation to bringing up their children is to be undermined. I therefore voted against this report.</p>

Language acquisition is the basis of logical thinking and contextual understanding. Without a certain level of language acquisition, further learning is scarcely possible, as the language deficits can only be overcome with great difficulty with increasing age. The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge. At the same time, it declares that migrant families (and minorities such as the Roma) make much less use of the early years education offered than other families. We cannot allow it to be the case that the level of our schools continues to fall and fall because so many pupils quite simply cannot understand the teaching. Every child – migrant or not – must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there. The report offers no meaningful attempts to solve this problem. Instead, it leans towards complete nannying of the parents and a state takeover of child-rearing. I therefore voted against this report.</p>

Moreover, if the Barcelona objective stipulating that EU Member States must provide childcare for at least 90% of children aged between three and the age at which compulsory education starts, and to at least 33% of children under the age of three, is to be achieved, we need agreement between the Member States and, where possible, exchanges of information and best practices, especially by Member States with highly developed structures in pre-school education to partners with less experience in that sector.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Early childhood care and education are made available in different ways throughout the European Union, with different definitions of ‘quality’, which depend significantly on the cultural values of each country and region, and on their interpretation of ‘childhood’. Early childhood learning is the basis for successful lifelong learning, which is central to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. I therefore voted in favour of the report on early childhood learning which sets out common EU objectives in pursuing the aims of the Barcelona European Council: specifically, that, by 2010, the provision of childcare should be ensured for at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age, and for 33% of children under the age of three. Like the rapporteur, I call for even more ambitious goals.

As well as this, there is a clear link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement. Therefore, we should ensure that the targets set at the Barcelona European Council of providing childcare to at least 90% of children between the age of three and the mandatory school age, and to at least 33% of children under the age of three, are met. Addressing educational disadvantage by providing high quality early childhood education and targeted support, and by promoting inclusive education, are absolutely necessary to create a truly inclusive society.</p>

Given the critical role played by parents as ‘main educators’, the report seeks to improve parental leave – which should be long enough to enable parents to play their leading role in educating their children in the early stages of their life – and encourages the Member States to invest in parental education programmes as well as provide other forms of assistance to parents who require additional help. Of course, this requires additional investment from all 27 Member States, and I am asking them to allocate adequate resources to ECEC services. For me, education must be a political priority.</p>

The report focuses its recommendations on the balance between the role of Member States and the Commission; the necessity to make early school a broader service inspired by good practices in Member States where ‘maternelles’ and kindergartens are a right of parents; inclusion of all children, whatever their social background (‘notion of public service’); caring for migrant children and their integration in early schools; the inclusion of arts and all tools to enhance the children’s creativity; training of educators for better intercultural skills; gender parity while working in structures for early learning; and creation of new and well qualified jobs.</p>

Unfortunately, we are still a long way from these figures. Yet the number and quality of support centres for childcare are crucial for Europe. Indeed, from a very young age, caring for children, their learning and gradual awareness of their environment are of decisive importance for the next phase of their education. In addition, their parents do not have to give up their professional aspirations because of a lack of childcare support centres. Nonetheless, this report reminds us, and rightly so, that each country has a different conception of childcare and different models thereof, which we should respect.

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on Early Years Learning in the EU. I would like to call particular attention to three matters. Firstly, the early years of childhood are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development. Therefore, when developing comprehensive early years policies and programmes, the Member States must take account of a number of different issues which affect childhood development, such as migration, gender equality and employment. Secondly, centres at local level should develop action programmes which take account of differing life situations and needs in the area of early childhood education and care. They must also have sufficient autonomy to enable the operation of programmes for children with uniqueness and creativity. The next matter is the need to improve early childhood education and care services. We should start here by developing mechanisms for evaluating provision and ensuring that quality standards are met.</p>
      <p sl="pl">My final observation concerns the need for universal access to childcare centres. Data provided by the Polish Ministry of Education show that in Poland, there are 8 400 public nursery schools and 1 600 private ones, and that there are around 1.6 million children aged from three to six years. This means there are nursery school places for barely 40% of these children, while there are 352 crèches in Poland, which are used by only 2% of children under three. This problem is one of the main reasons for the high unemployment among women.</p>

I agree with this proposal, for which I voted, but I think that catch control needs to be scientifically monitored, navigation control systems need to be modernised and wrecks need to be cleaned. Surveillance should also be strengthened and illegal vessels impounded.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This resolution was adopted following the proposal by the Commission aimed at opening the negotiations on renewing the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania. Voting in favour of a resolution is unfortunately the only thing Parliament can do to be heard in the negotiations of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA). At present, Parliament can only have its say once the negotiations have ended, which leaves it no other option than to either approve these agreements or reject their ratification, thus leaving it very little room for manoeuvre. Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be ‘immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure’. Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations. This issue is not new and raises regular questioning of the European Commission by the members of the Committee on Fisheries. It is regrettable that we are not able to make binding our opinion on our priorities relating to the provision of European funds to the countries concerned, in spite of the fact that Parliament has the power to exercise financial control.</p>

Improvements in terms of infrastructure and of building adequate facilities for unloading fish along Mauritania’s central and southern coasts must be promoted, to enable the EU fleet to operate more efficiently, thereby facilitating the flow of investment and increasing this agreement’s impact on the local economy. As regards the actual catches, they should be limited to surpluses and to those stocks that cannot be caught by Mauritania’s fishing fleet, so that the environmental equilibrium can be maintained and the activity can remain sustainable over the years.</p>

The priority is now to resume the negotiations that were already under way, but based on new premises and involving States which have, until now, been excluded from these negotiations. We must also review some requests that go back to the negotiations on the original agreement, in which Mauritania, for example, made a last minute request for further biological rest periods on fishing in May and June, in addition to that already agreed for the months of September and October.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution. A well-functioning procurement market is particularly important for fostering the integrity of the Single Market and stimulating innovation, and for achieving optimal value for public authorities and tax payers. This market is a particularly important part of the EU economy and has huge potential, but procurement rules and principles vary across the Member States and prevent companies, particularly small ones, from gaining access to cross-border procurement. Similar restrictions also exist in terms of access to third-country tenders. Despite the fact that the EU has opened up its markets, our companies face huge problems if they want to access public sector markets in third countries. I feel that significant political attention must be given to this issue as a matter of urgency. The Commission should conduct a detailed analysis of the problems relating to restricted access for EU companies to other countries’ markets and take appropriate action against trading partners which benefit from the openness of the EU market, but do not open up their own markets to EU companies.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Public contracts represent important economic opportunities for companies, are very important in the promotion of the Single Market, stimulate innovation, and promote the protection of the environment and climate, as well as social inclusion.

We can no longer be naïve: the survival of our businesses and our jobs depends on this. Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted.

      <p sl="pt">This is yet another attempt to push through the liberalisation of public procurement. This is a direction that the EU is doggedly following both at home and in third countries, using free trade agreements.</p>

      <p sl="pt">With this resolution, the majority in Parliament wants to call for the liberalisation of public procurement on the pretext of relaxing and simplifying the rules and defending small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although there could be justification for this in some cases, in the majority of cases, it is not this that is at stake.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What they want is to prevent any country from protecting its own companies in public procurement, just to make things easier for the big companies of the powers that also wish to dominate the awarding of public contracts. That is why we voted against.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It also seems the importance of strengthening anti-corruption mechanisms in the context of the European Union’s commitments in the field of international public procurement should be stressed, as should the need to focus efforts on ensuring transparency and fairness in the use of public funds.

      <p sl="pl">Despite the openness of the EU public procurement market, access to third-country public procurement markets is still restricted to a large extent. In this situation, European businesses do not have equal opportunities for competing for public tenders in other countries of the world. For example, in 2009, the Chinese authorities adopted a system of accreditation of innovative local products, which restricted yet further access on the part of international businesses to the Chinese market. However, it is not only the Chinese market which is a problem, because highly developed economies such as the United States, Japan and Canada also pursue protectionist policies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This is why I support the call for application of the principle of reciprocity in access to public procurement markets contained in the resolution which was adopted today and which I endorsed in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which I drafted. I would, however, like the future European Commission proposal on the principle of reciprocity to contribute in particular to the opening of the procurement markets of third countries, and not just to restrict access for businesses from third countries to public procurement markets in the European Union, which might have an adverse effect on competitiveness in the Union market.</p>

Regarding access to the European Union’s public procurement markets by businesses from third countries, the European Union has a duty to act realistically and pragmatically and, above all, without naivety. This is not about taking a stand against the opening-up of our markets, but rather the quite legitimate position of advocating mutual access in this area, not by closing our public procurement markets, but by ensuring that our partners outside the European Union open up their markets in an equivalent way and, if necessary, by developing appropriate mechanisms enabling us to achieve this objective of reciprocity and balance.</p>

Moreover, in order to support their business, I invite the European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity and to think of new ways of improving access by European companies to public procurement outside the Union, in order to ensure equal conditions for European and foreign companies who are competing for the allocation of public contracts.</p>

In a context where recruitment is becoming more and more difficult, and where the practices that fishermen must adopt continue to become ever more restrictive, the increase in fuel prices makes conditions even more difficult in this crisis-hit sector. The substantial increase in oil prices is having a strong impact on fishermen’s operational costs, and this caused their revenue to fall between 2008 and 2010. As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis aid. This measure would relieve the pressure on fishermen, thereby enabling them to make a decent living from their work without hindering the replenishment of stocks.

Consequently, I welcome the call by our Chamber to introduce greater flexibility in the de minimis subsidy scheme.

In the European Union, 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide more than 100 million jobs, make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation. SMEs face significant problems in expanding their activities and improving their ability to innovate and their access to markets.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I urge Member States to adopt without delay the proposal on the European Private Company Statute, which would enable SMEs to trade throughout the EU, while cutting costs and encouraging growth in this area, promoting a 25% reduction in administration and stimulating business. I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution.</p>

There are 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs.

The Small Business Act adopted in 2008 was a significant political step aimed at improving the business environment for SMEs, ensuring better and simpler regulation and simplifying market access. However, SMEs continue to face serious problems expanding their activities and innovative capacities and it is difficult for them to access markets, above all, due to difficulties obtaining financing and administrative obstacles, which should also be reduced further.

At the same time, I feel there is a need to strengthen dialogue between SMEs and public procurement bodies in order to simplify the involvement of SMEs in public procurement procedures. I would consider it appropriate in these circumstances to examine the options for helping SMEs to create partnerships and consortia, and to participate jointly in public contracts. The Commission should produce an assessment of the impacts and consider the possibility of increasing the ceilings for EU public contracts, which would allow SMEs to take part in contracts that would otherwise be subject to special requirements, on account of which SMEs would not be able to participate.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would also like to call on the Commission to consider how it might be possible in Europe to improve the publication of all public procurement notices and to eliminate the administrative burden which prevents European firms from taking part in transboundary public contracts.

In a context of difficult recovery and of increased international economic competition, establishing a European strategy would be welcome. The ‘Small Business Act’ is aimed at increasing entrepreneurship in Europe and helping businesses grow. Therefore, it is an absolute requirement that we reduce administrative formalities and put in place a modern administration adapted to the needs of SMEs. That is why the Commission must establish a unified system for setting up a business.

SMEs were the first to be affected by the financial and banking crisis that has taken place these last few years, which reduced their access to financing and to the markets.

      <p sl="pt">This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a review of the Small Business Act (SBA). The SBA is a series of political principles aiming to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of access to finance and markets, as well as of improved legislation. The social, economic and financial role of SMEs in the European Union is unquestionable. There are around 23 million of them in the EU, accounting for 99% of all businesses and providing over 100 million jobs. The current financial crisis has had a negative impact on these companies. That is why there is a need to review the current legislation, so as to facilitate access to financing; to reduce administrative costs and all bureaucracy; to encourage energy saving, as only 24% of companies currently recognise its importance; to improve businesses’ technology through eco-innovation; to promote improved levels of qualification, education and professional training; and to promote internationalisation and good governance.

      <p sl="pl">As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I took part in the work and negotiations on the Late Payments Directive, which is one of the key legislative proposals announced in the original version of the Small Business Act. I hope the Member States will take pains to implement its provisions as quickly as possible and correctly. The Small Business Act is a good proposal for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, I do have doubts over the qualitative assessment of work which has been done. As an example, I would like to mention the Annex to the review drafted by the European Commission. The Annex contains examples of some good practices, and among them, in the part concerning the Single Market, it mentions the fact that 22 Member States have set up operational one-stop shops (points of single contact). I would like to remind everyone that these points were set up pursuant to the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Barely three months ago, this House adopted a report on implementation of the Services Directive, in which we draw attention principally to the fact that the one-stop shops are not fully operational, that in most cases, they do not allow completion of formalities by electronic means and that they are not working in the way which businesses expect. I hope that drawing attention to individual one-stop shops which are good examples will be followed by greater efforts to improve the operation of all of them, so that they really will serve small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

We also need to promote the 25% reduction of administrative burden indicated in the SBA, which would contribute to the effectiveness of the SBA, would counteract any protectionist economic policies of Member States and stimulate business across the EU. Member States must swiftly implement the revised Late Payments Directive to effectively combat late payments and their negative impact, particularly on SMEs. Member States should also avoid ‘gold-plating’ by exceeding the requirements of EU legislation when transposing directives into national law. The administrative burden is relatively higher the smaller the size of the company – a disproportionate and incorrect provision which reduces the setting up of SMEs. There needs to be a differentiation between micro, small and medium-sized businesses. I believe that small businesses should be assisted to increase their ability to compete in international markets by enhancing their ability to export, disseminating information concerning programmes and initiatives facilitating international market access and penetration of SME goods and services, and ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented.</p>

More than a raft of incentives and targeted funding, our small and medium-sized enterprises need greater and simpler freedom of action, hence less bureaucracy, and also certain guarantees. On this latter point, we should call upon Member States to resolve the issue of late payments, which has created and continues to create serious problems and difficulties.

Efficient use of resources is another aspect also related to the future quality of life in the EU. We are always talking about this, but so far in practice, we have unfortunately taken too little action for our words to be translated into reality. On the other hand, efficient use of resources as a measure on its own is not enough – in general, there needs to be a sustainable attitude to the environment at every stage of business development.

It is therefore important to congratulate the Commission on its analysis of the Small Business Act and support the new proposals put forward to pursue the objectives of supporting the SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ninety-nine percent of European companies are SMEs. Two-thirds of jobs in the private sector are provided by the SME base. More than half of European added value is produced by SMEs. There will be no genuine recovery of the economy, or long-term economic growth, without substantial action on the part of public authorities, whether local, national or European, in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises. By adopting the ‘Small Business Act’ in 2008, the European Commission made the first decisive step towards small and medium-sized enterprises by introducing the ‘Think Small First’ principle in all areas of legislation. Despite the many proposals that have been seen through in the last three years – I am thinking of the Late Payments Directive in particular – a lot of progress remains to be achieved to make things easier for small and medium-sized enterprises, not only in respect of the administrative burden they have to deal with, but also the difficulty in accessing funding that they experience. The European Commission must continue on the path it defined with the SBA in 2008. This is what this resolution, which I lend my support to, calls for.</p>

The report acknowledges the key role of SMEs in the transition to an economy characterised by resource efficiency and it is also essential to acknowledge the role of young entrepreneurs.

      <p sl="fr">I welcome the adoption of the resolution on the review of the ‘Small Business Act’ with a resounding majority of the European Parliament. SMEs, which represent 99% of European businesses, provide two-thirds of jobs in the private sector and generate over half of the added value created, in total, by businesses operating in the EU. SMEs play a key role in innovation, research and development. By adopting the ‘Small Business Act’ in 2008, the European Commission made the first decisive step for these SMEs by introducing the ‘Think Small First’ principle in all areas of legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Many proposals have been seen through in three years, such as the Late Payments Directive.

      <p sl="lt">As the rapporteur accurately observed, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of European society and the engine of our economy. This is also true of Lithuania, where 99.4% of Lithuanian companies employ fewer than 250 people. According to government statistics, in January 2011, there were more than 66 500 SMEs operating in Lithuania. What Lithuanians desperately need is smarter regulation, less bureaucracy and fewer administrative burdens. Obtaining planning permission is one of the greatest problems faced by investors in Lithuania. According to a report by the World Bank, 17 procedures need to be carried out in order to obtain permission and this may take 162 days. In this area, according to the World Bank’s classification, Lithuania ranks 59th in the world. Investor protection in Lithuania is an even greater problem; in this area, Lithuania ranks 93rd. This really is no good. I believe that a successful strategy for promoting innovative SMEs should not just be supported by subsidies, but by the creation of a business environment, where SMEs would have more freedom and improved access to various sources of financing. I also believe that SMEs should pay more attention to social and labour market issues, which have an impact on entrepreneurship and SMEs’ abilities to employ workers with the relevant skills.</p>

The 23 million SMEs in the EU provide over 100 million jobs and make a huge contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation. We need to make sure that these vital businesses are not hampered by red tape and bureaucracy, and I agree that the EU needs to renew its efforts to reduce administrative burdens. I am pleased that almost all legislative proposals under the Small Business Act have been adopted but urge Member States to implement the revised Late Payments Directive without delay.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted against the resolution on the Small Business Act Review, put forward by the European Commission in February 2011. This review – in particular, the reduction of administrative and bureaucratic costs and burdens – is consistent with the Act as it currently stands. Its proposal to harmonise taxation systems must not result in yet another reduction in taxes on businesses – admittedly, small businesses – while salaries are hit by the austerity plans. It is true that the review aims to improve SMEs’ access to financing, but it fails to mention social and environmental issues and does not even refer to the European Commission’s plan for a Social Business Initiative, announced for the end of this year. It is true that the Small Business Act Review, in making this proposal, moves us a little way towards a social economy, but it does so through its weakness with respect to the challenges associated with these other forms of action. Like the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the Small Business Act Review does not learn the lessons of the Monti report for re-establishing citizens’ confidence in the European Union. It therefore still conforms to the same ultra-liberal logic of European integration that we have been condemning for years, a logic which is, first and foremost, centred on the market and its needs.</p>

We must put their development, their modernisation and their competitiveness at the heart of our economic strategy.

There is still much to be done to simplify the regulatory environment and the administrative procedures that are weighing too heavily on the activity and dynamism of our businesses. I welcome the actions proposed in this report, such as the creation of a European Private Company Statute. This would help our SMEs to draw the full benefits of the Single Market by allowing them to carry out their cross-border activities without requiring them to fulfil obligations which are often onerous and discouraging. I therefore call on the Council to give its opinion on this initiative quickly. Finally, we must come to the aid of innovative SMEs by facilitating their access to diverse forms of financing. That will be achieved, in particular, by significantly simplifying the use of European credits, which are still lacking in flexibility. These credits exist, and I think that they must be utilised in order to provide more effective support for the development of the real economy, innovation and employment.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this proposal, as I agree with the rapporteur when she says that union is strength. Joining forces to innovate and solve common problems in Europe means faster developments, efficiency (cost-efficiency), and greater creativity. The Innovation Union should also increase Europe’s competitiveness, to help find a way out of the economic crisis. As Europe is very dependent on imports, the Member States are united in feeling the need to use intelligently and sustainably the raw materials and commodities required to generate energy or for use in industry or food production. The ageing of the population is another challenge facing nearly every country in the EU. With the aim of giving people more years of healthy life, with the appropriate care and medicines, but, at the same time, controlling costs, a joint approach may yield results more quickly. Europe’s economies have become so interlinked nowadays that it is not only the stability of the euro that requires a common approach: so do efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Member States. What is needed is a common path towards an equitable and stable economy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Europe has been, is and will remain a cradle of global civilisation, education, research and culture. What is certain, and is also mentioned in the Commission communication, is that Europe does not lack in potential, whether human, technical, commercial or financial. My question is: what is Europe doing to utilise primarily its human resource potential? How does Europe intend to keep its human resources, which are so essential to innovation in Europe’s schools, universities and research centres? Before focusing on attracting experts from outside the European Union, I feel that our priority is to halt the exodus of researchers from Europe to other important centres across the world. Establishing a modernised education system throughout the whole of Europe, placing strong emphasis on substantive research results and, of course, simplifying access to cross-border research programmes in Europe can raise the level of innovation in the EU. However, to ensure that human resources remain here, Europe must focus on the following aspect: making researchers attractive offers, proposals which they cannot refuse. In fact, it must persuade them that, at every level, there is nowhere better than home.</p>

The Innovation Union flagship initiative is the most significant and targeted Community attempt so far to introduce a strategic, integrated and business-oriented European innovation policy to supplement Member State efforts, whereby innovation is steered and progress monitored at the highest political level. Innovations are particularly important for combating global challenges such as climate change, energy and food security, etc., where there is a need to innovate and reinforce the existing scientific and technological base. It is also necessary to modernise education systems and adapt them to the needs of the times.

      <p sl="fr">The ‘Innovation Union’ initiative still remains the most important Union initiative for developing an integrated European strategy in relation to research and innovation. Increasing the pace of research and innovation is crucial for introducing a fair and competitive economic model, ensuring jobs for the future, moving towards sustainable resource management, facing up to energy challenges and stimulating a knowledge-based society. In terms of jobs, the environment and development, innovation is thus one of the major challenges facing the European Union and will have concrete repercussions on citizens. From now on, European citizens, as both the engines and the beneficiaries of innovation, must be able to participate fully in this ‘Innovation Union’ in order to ensure that it is successful, as we emphasised in this report. Finally, we wanted for that reason to highlight how essential an innovation policy is, as well as the added value of a coordinated approach at European level. In order to face up to the shared major social and economic challenges that European society faces, we need ambitious initiatives.

      <p sl="it">The concept of innovation is multidimensional: it includes not only scientific research and experimental and technological development, but also the development of new processes, methodologies and organisational and behavioural models. While welcoming the Commission communication on Innovation Union as a flagship initiative of the EU 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, I think there are still priority areas where we need a greater commitment to building capacities in science, technology and innovation: efficient resource use, recovery and recycling of waste, food quality and safety, and new epidemics. According to the conclusions of the 2009 European Innovation Panel, the recent economic and financial crisis has had disproportionate effects in different countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am concerned that the current budgetary constraints imposed on Member States may lead to greater restrictions on investment in research and innovation, with obvious negative effects on European growth and competitiveness.

      <p sl="es">There is a future provided that there is innovation. Having said this, I have voted in favour of Amendment 1 because I am completely against using common agricultural policy funds to provide the resources needed for the programmes.

An innovative Europe can bring innovation to agriculture, so that it may build a future just the same as that of the other strategic sectors.</p>

      <p sl="it">The call in the report for the introduction of the single European patent and the satisfaction it expresses over the adoption of enhanced cooperation regarding the introduction of the patent prevent me from voting in favour. The introduction of an Anglo-Franco-German European patent is unacceptable for at least two reasons. First, trilingualism would have a negative impact on the competitiveness of companies in the Member States not represented in the system. These companies, including Italian ones, would have to await the completion of the translation process before being able to obtain the documents, at the expense of the ability to act quickly, which is of the utmost importance in business. They would also have to shoulder the additional costs of translation. In contrast, Anglo-Franco-German companies would not have to put up with any of these barriers, which would give rise to discrimination on the basis of language. Furthermore, the introduction of a trilingual system does not seem to conform to administrative requirements and does not even seem to reflect the demographic weighting of the Member States, because in that case, Italy should also be represented. Instead, it seems like an attempt to impose the prestige of Germany at the expense of the principles of parity and equality between Member States on which the EU is founded.

It is necessary to make more use of Commission programmes such as ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’ and, at the same time, to protect skilled trades as a source of innovation. In my opinion, the Commission should cooperate more with Member States in drawing up medium-term and long-term outlooks in relation to the qualifications needed on the job market and in supporting partnerships between universities and the business sector, with the aim of making it easier for young people to enter the job market and helping in the creation of innovative companies based on knowledge, the development of applied research and better prospects for graduates on the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="it">Innovation in many respects is the key to economic growth. Already by the second half of the twentieth century, the most respected growth economists had understood that innovation is one of the main variables for leveraging falling profits. This is how we made the transition from the growth models of the 1950s, according to which the economy sooner or later stabilises and loses its momentum, to the endogenous growth models of the 1980s, in which technology and the design of constantly different and innovative products allow the economy to maintain a positive growth rate over the long term. In order to set these leverage mechanisms in motion, which, from now until 2020, will take the form of research, energy efficiency and internationalisation targets, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, there needs to be a strong political desire to activate incentives and orientation mechanisms. These are the responsibility of the Member States, and European funding can provide them with valid support. Resources are limited due to the crisis, and the directives in Europe 2020 need to go hand in hand with strong fiscal and industrial policies on the part of the European governments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which I drafted, I sought to summarise the main points of our view and concerns in this area. On the basis of this draft opinion, it can easily be said that there are clear points of disagreement with the Commission communication. In particular, these focus on aspects also included in this report, which is where some of the contradictions it contains are to be found: the view of innovation as essentially a business opportunity; the emphasis given to the market, to competition, and to harnessing innovation for business purposes; the advocating of the Internal Market and EU patents.

      <p sl="pt">The report sufficiently highlights innovation, which constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humanity today. It should be a key element of public policy in areas like the environment, water, energy, transport, telecommunications, health and education, and should help resolve problems like the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic changes, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the report includes a number of contradictions because it is founded on neoliberal ideas, defending the Internal Market and advocating EU patents, with which we disagree.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The constraints currently imposed on the Member States could result in increased restrictions on investment in science, technology and innovation (STI), particularly in the most vulnerable countries. Instead of the announced ‘Innovation Union’, the result could be a veritable ‘innovation divide’ between the countries and regions that innovate most and the rest.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Where there should be public interest, development, cohesion, progress and social welfare, what has ended up predominating are so-called business opportunities, the market, competitiveness, competition, and the harnessing of innovation for business purposes.</p>

I am utterly convinced that the EU must take an offensive stance and take a firm front runner position in competitiveness, and must therefore invest in an innovation blast.

The Innovation Union should not only provide an answer to shared problems, but also increase Europe’s competitiveness and find a way out of the economic crisis. As Europe is very dependent on imports, the Member States are united in feeling the need to use intelligently and sustainably the raw materials and commodities required to generate energy or for use in industry or food production. Europe’s economies have become so interlinked nowadays that it is not only the stability of the euro that requires a common approach: so do efforts to increase the competitiveness of the Member States.

      <p sl="de">In the past, innovation has primarily been envisaged in the field of research. It should not be forgotten, though, that innovation can come from any EU citizen. These concepts – which often start out simply as ideas – should be supported at EU level by means of easier access to funding, simplified authorisation procedures and cheap and straightforward patents, amongst other things. That will enable the citizens themselves to exercise influence and help shape a sustainable society.</p>
      <p sl="de">Moreover, innovations of this kind, where the focus absolutely should remain on research, would help to maintain high living standards in Europe.

      <p sl="el">The report clarifies what goes without saying; that it is impossible to support innovation without supporting research and education. Although there are no foregone conclusions as to when the economic crisis will abate, the targets set by the Member States for 2020 in the research sector will not be achieved as things currently stand, just as the targets set in the previous European strategy, the Lisbon strategy, were not achieved. Data available to date illustrate that – roughly – a mere 2.7% of European GDP will be channelled into research at the end of the decade, despite the Member States’ clear commitment to spend at least 3% for that purpose. At the same time, the Member States are citing the crisis as the reason for cutbacks in spending on education. In other words, the two basic pillars of innovation are being undermined, rather than strengthened, and this should be a source of concern to national governments.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report ‘on Innovation Union: transforming Europe for a post-crisis world’ includes a series of measures that constitute major social challenges. The rapporteur introduces the key idea of creating a union between all Europeans for innovation. Indeed, as is argued, finding solutions for common problems in Europe is a challenge for faster development, greater cost efficiency and increased creative strength. Innovation Union also aims to boost the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, in order to find a way out of the economic crisis. Given the widespread dependence on imports, the Member States feel a common need to seek methods for the smart and sustainable use of those resources and raw materials needed to produce energy, as well as for industry or food production. The ageing population issue is another challenge being faced by almost all EU countries. A joint approach on issues like health could ensure a longer life, with proper care and medication, all while reducing costs. These are only the major examples of common standards among the 27 Member States, as encouraged by this initiative, and are the basis of my vote for it.</p>

Reaching our target of investing 3% of our GDP on R&amp;D by 2020 could mean a return of 3.7 million jobs and almost EUR 800 billion.

      <p sl="fr">Innovation is to European politics what education is to young people: a passport to the future, a virtually comprehensive insurance for a society that is making progress and preserving social cohesion. This phrase takes on its full meaning in this post-global recession period during which we are seeing speedier economic recovery in the United States and still unashamed growth in the emerging powers referred to as the BRIC group. One thing is clear: the European Union is lagging behind and the labour market is struggling to recover. The ultimate irony is that Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, remains the European champion of innovation. That is why the call today by the European Parliament (the Merkies report) for a genuine ‘change in mentality’ is important, because innovation is not just about technological inventions or the number of patents filed per inhabitant. First and foremost, it is about building on the SME base, which is the main generator of wealth in Europe, through venture capital, guarantee facilities, assistance with loans and simplification of the legislative environment. On this condition, perhaps the aspiration of 3% of GDP to be devoted to R&amp;D will become a reality?</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Research and Innovation Union scoreboard mentions that Japan and the United States invest a greater percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in innovation than the EU, with the gap increasing over the last four years.

      <p sl="pt">I therefore consider it essential that the European Union adopt a true innovation strategy, taking into account the Europe 2020 strategy of smart specialisation, with a view to reinforcing support for research, development and innovation (RDI) as a key element of the Union’s future, extending it into all the areas, sectors of activity and social agents of which it is comprised.</p>

It is vital to adapt and simplify development policy, for example, the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The new strategic agenda will enable the construction of an increasingly modern and competitive Europe that plays a leading role in the world.

      <p sl="fr">The Union has not been able to make up its shortfall in terms of innovation, in spite of the Lisbon strategy. In a context of budgetary restrictions – which rules out public money as a solution – and increased global competition, Europe must react in order to get itself back into the innovation race. I think that it is essential to focus on structural reforms that will eliminate the obstacles holding back the considerable potential for innovation in Europe. I therefore supported this report, which notably points the finger at the high costs associated with the filing of patents in all Member States, and calls for a speedy agreement on the single European patent. I am also pleased to see that proposals by my political family have been taken up – in particular, the creation of a European innovation fund, which will simplify access to European credits for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Liberating the capacity for innovation in Europe requires setting a minimum spending threshold, in terms of research and development, in each Member State. This would ensure an equitable division of efforts and prevent the development of a two-speed Europe, which would disrupt the cohesion and governance of the EU. This is essential if Europe wants to remain at the highest level of the global economy.</p>

      <p sl="es">I fully support the ILO’s initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers. Many of these workers are undocumented migrants, which means that they are more likely to be mistreated, paid irregularly or subjected to violence. Moreover, undocumented workers do not dare to contact the authorities to seek protection, claim their rights or access health services because they fear being returned to their home country and/or punishment by their employer. All domestic workers, regardless of their origin, must have decent access to work.</p>

All those who work with our elderly people must be able to enjoy freedom of association and rest time, and must not be subject to harassment and arbitrary practices. That is why we wanted to send a strong message of support to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the trades unions prior to the negotiations on the adoption of these new instruments, which will commence in June at the 100th International Labour conference.

      <p sl="en">I supported this resolution on the ILO convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers. This convention aims to provide legal recognition for domestic work as work, to extend rights to all domestic workers, and to prevent violations and abuses. The European Parliament resolution further calls on the EU countries which are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011 and calls on the EU Member States to ratify and implement the convention and recommendation quickly. In some countries, much domestic work takes place in the informal economy, under precarious employment conditions and/or as undeclared work. In industrialised countries, domestic work accounts for between 5 and 9% of all employment, with the vast majority of the people employed in that sector being women. Indeed, the trend towards an increase in the proportion of non-standard or atypical contracts has a strong gender and generational dimension. The adoption, ratification and implementation of the ILO convention can have an impact by reducing the numbers of working poor and improve the position of the large number of women on the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work. These women contribute to our economy, yet they suffer very poor working conditions and violations of their most basic rights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a ‘Convention on decent work for domestic workers’. This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards. The ball is now in the court of the Member States, as they have to commit to ratify this convention.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At European level, we will also need to stop considering separately and systematically the immigration and labour policies.

The importance of domestic work is indisputable. It is work carried out in the home – childcare and elderly-care facilities – that is included in the Europe 2020 strategy and represents 5% to 9% of all work undertaken in the EU, with the trend being towards growth. However, domestic workers – the majority of whom are women and immigrants – are often subjected to exploitation by their bosses, who do not guarantee their social rights.

The severely exploitative and discriminatory conditions under which they work are well known.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because the crisis has wiped out millions of jobs and has aggravated job insecurity and poverty – 17% of EU residents are at risk of poverty and 23 million EU residents are unemployed.

The vast majority of the people employed in this sector are women and such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal. Domestic workers’ vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment. Domestic work should be legally recognised as work, we should give all domestic workers more rights and prevent violations and abuses in order to establish a legal framework for all domestic workers and ensure that their work does not take place outside the regulatory framework. The adoption, ratification and implementation of the ILO convention would not only improve the position of a large number of women on the labour market for domestic work by guaranteeing them decent working conditions, but would also enhance their degree of social inclusion.

These workers are often exposed to poverty and irregular conditions, are more likely to be victims of mistreatment, paid irregularly, or subjected to violence or sexual abuse, and are less likely to approach the authorities to seek protection and claim their rights, for fear of being returned to their country of origin and/or punished by their employers. This situation is the reason why I voted for the resolution.

      <p sl="sv">Yesterday, Thursday, 12 May, the European Parliament voted through the resolution on the proposed ILO convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers. Throughout the world, and in poor countries in particular, domestic services are among the lowest paid jobs. These jobs often lack correct contracts and social benefits. Highlighting this service sector separately in a recommendation in association with an ILO convention is therefore right and proper. The reason why I voted against the European Parliament’s resolution is the wording in paragraph 13, in which the EU Member States are called on to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, something that no EU Member State has done as yet. In my opinion, the six key UN conventions, which are universal and cover all people, do not need to be supplemented by further instruments. There would then be a high risk of the legitimacy of the conventions that have already been adopted being undermined, which is something that I do not wish to be party to. I would rather work to increase compliance with the key human rights conventions, the content of which clearly also applies to domestic workers. This is something that far too many signatory states seem to be ignoring today.</p>

This amendment is consistent with this ever more negative perception of immigrants which fuels xenophobia.

      <p sl="pt">As regards the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, I would draw attention to the fact that this endangers the health, not only of the animals, which become resistant to the antibiotics, but also of people, as products of animal origin enter the food chain, thereby affecting humans.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A study of the possibility of banning the use of antimicrobials in animal feed is therefore urgently needed, as is promotion of measures to reduce resistance to antibiotics, thereby ensuring better animal health and increased food safety.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This European Parliament resolution tackles the problem of animal resistance to antibiotics, which is a situation with disastrous consequences. This issue has implications in terms of human health, particularly for those who work with these animals, but also of economics, as the competitive future of EU animal husbandry is at stake. Parliament has already debated this issue more than once and has adopted a number of initiatives, like the database, which should be continuously updated. However, the time has come to move from words to actions so that the legislation in force ceases to be a dead letter. Therefore, it is essential that the new common agricultural policy (CAP) takes this problem into account and encourages good animal husbandry practices. As such, I voted for this joint motion for a resolution, adopted by a broad majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it is a very balanced text whose proposals not only protect human health and defend animal welfare, but also ensure companies’ viability.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because the ultimate objective is to maintain antimicrobials as an effective tool to combat disease, both in animals and in humans, while only using antimicrobials when absolutely necessary. In my opinion, we need to establish good practices for animal husbandry which minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These practices should apply, in particular, to young animals which are brought together from different breeders and thus increase the risk of communicable diseases. The Commission should work towards an international ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, and bring this matter up in its bilateral negotiations with third countries such as the United States. We must emphasise the logical connection between animal health and the use of antimicrobials, as well as the link between animal health and human health. Today, the most important thing is for us to ensure a maximum level of food safety.</p>

      <p sl="de">For a long time, antibiotics were seen as a wonder drug that cured infectious diseases. In most European countries, antibiotics are the most-used class of drugs after analgesics. Around 50% of the antibiotics prescribed in Europe are used in veterinary medicine. If antibiotics were not used, animal diseases and epizootics could quickly spread and become epidemics, causing enormous economic damage. Unfortunately, the uncontrolled use of antibiotics in both human and veterinary medicine comes at a very high cost. The excessive use of antibiotics leads to resistance and adaptation among pathogens. Many of the well-known antibiotics have today become either ineffective or unreliable. I therefore strongly endorse the resolution of this House that expressly calls on the Commission and the Member States to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance amongst animals in a responsible way.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially when treatment failure occurs. Guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials have already been issued in several Member States, which has led to a reduction in the use of antimicrobials.

      <p sl="lt">Today, Parliament adopted an important decision on antibiotic resistance. In my opinion, it is very important to collect and analyse information on the use of animal health products, including antibiotic substances. It is also necessary to ensure that these products are used effectively and moderately and do not pose a risk to the effectiveness of measures for combating human illnesses when antibiotic agents are chosen as a treatment in medicine. Although, from 2005-2009 in the EU, tests for monitoring the residues of antibacterial agents in animals and animal foodstuffs show positive results, we can still say that there is no controlled trend towards reduction, only fragmented fluctuations. Particularly worrying is the fact that according to 2009 data, the majority of discrepancies as regards antibiotic agents were found in honey, rabbit and farmed fish samples, in other words, products that are frequently considered to be valuable foodstuffs and are often used in Europeans’ daily diet. Thus, the aim of carefully applying antimicrobial treatment and implementing comprehensive monitoring in order to better coordinate sources of human and veterinary research is very important for guaranteeing human health and animal welfare.</p>

I believe that commitment to research is essential, as it contributes to the development of antimicrobials as an effective tool in the fight against diseases afflicting both people and animals.

      <p sl="de">Antibiotics are naturally occurring metabolic products of fungi or bacteria that are used to counter bacterial infections. Amongst other uses, they are fed to animals on a preventative basis. Resistance means the loss of an antibiotic’s ability to kill bacteria or inhibit their growth. In order to prevent this, it is necessary to follow medical instructions. Resistant animal germs can be passed on to humans, however, and represent a major health risk – the result may even be antibiotic resistance in humans. It was therefore only right to vote in favour of this report in order to finally promote livestock production that manages without antimicrobial substances.</p>

      <p sl="sk">It is common knowledge that, just like humans, animals that are given antibiotics are sometimes resistant to their effect. This resistance may be transferred from animals to humans, and thereby pose a risk to health, or complicate the treatment of some diseases. It is therefore important to monitor in detail the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and the keeping of pets. This is about consumer protection and the security of food production, which must be ensured to an equally high standard in all EU Member States. It is appropriate for a European Parliament made up of the elected representatives of the people to demand that the Commission take action. We can react rapidly and effectively only if we know the true situation.

Multilingualism, e-skills and cultural awareness allow us to seize many opportunities offered by today’s global labour market. Culture should therefore be integrated across the board in the wide spectrum of actions that make up the EU’s foreign policy. A coherent, coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU’s external actions does not currently exist.

It is this cultural dimension that the EU should take more into account in its diplomatic efforts, particularly with a view to promoting human rights, democracy and development in third countries. To achieve this, the High-Representative should set up a ‘Cultural diplomacy’ Directorate-General within the European External Action Service, and appoint someone to be responsible for cultural relations and for promoting European culture in every EU representation in third countries.

      <p sl="pt">As well as an economic power, the European Union is also a cultural power whose influence goes far beyond its borders.

The importance of the factor of language as a vehicle for maintaining and deepening these contacts cannot be overstated.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I regret that, despite all the declarations of intent, the European Union continues not to understand the extent to which it should promote the teaching of the European languages that are particularly suitable for communication in its institutions. Instead, the EU has chosen an inward-looking language policy. I should like to see this trend reversed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A foreign policy like the one that the Union is proposing to develop cannot neglect the cultural dimension, but rather must keep it in mind as an asset; as a value that is not always tangible but is particularly important in a world increasingly susceptible to the ‘soft power’ of states and international organisations.

The EU has to be a community of cultural values in which diversity is an asset, and a factor in unity and cohesion, or, as the rapporteur puts it, ‘an instrument for global peace and stability’. We therefore urgently need to review the lack of a foreign policy on culture. I am voting for this report, as I agree with its proposals and hope that culture helps find solutions for emerging from the crisis, and that it will be an asset to the welfare of the European public.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report confirms the understanding of culture current in the European Union: an exploitative vision of culture that considers it at the service of foreign policy through the concept of cultural diplomacy. In other words, culture is seen as a sort of vanguard for advancing and communicating the interests of the European Union and the Member States in the world (point 22), and look where this vision is headed: for promoting international trade (point 23). How often is this not synonymous with policies and practices that cancel out or disrespect each country’s identity and cultures?</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution because cultural diplomacy is a cornerstone for building trust and long lasting relations with citizens in third countries. Culture should be a vital and horizontally integrated element among the broad spectrum of external policies which make up the EU’s foreign policy: from the EU’s trade relations to its enlargement and neighbourhood policy, to its development cooperation policy and its common foreign and security policy. Culture equally has economic value: Europe’s cultural industries contribute to European entrepreneurship, innovation and business and the EU’s diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive global tourist destination in the world. A vibrant cultural climate makes living in the EU attractive for businesses and people alike. A coherent, coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU’s external actions does not currently exist and needs to be developed. It is not a luxury but a necessity to sustain and foster Europe’s attractiveness in a globally connected and competitive environment. Fragmentation and diffusion is seen not only among Member States, but also between different departments and institutions within the EU. This fragmentation without a common strategy hampers the full and efficient use of cultural resources and budgets. Consequently, this strategy is absolutely essential for the EU.</p>

My support for Mrs Schaake’s report is dictated precisely by the boost that we need to give to reinforcing this shared awareness. Culture should play a unifying role externally as well as internally, and therefore, in the relations of the Secretariat for Economic Monitoring (SEAE), European culture could be the standard-bearer of European values, which, through dialogue with cultures outside Europe, should contribute to peaceful cooperation and constructive understanding between peoples.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries is closely connected in many respects with the report on the Innovation Union. I would like, in particular, to draw attention to the significance that is given to the education of citizens, involving, among other things, a better understanding of the issue and respect for the protection of works involving intellectual property rights. We must strongly support and develop this broadly neglected area not just of education but also of training, both at the EU level and where Member States are concerned. I have reservations over the current labelling of cultural works as goods and services. This is misleading and can be seen as a manifestation of economic neoliberalism in the cultural sphere. For example, a literary work, or even a work of art or music is, first and foremost, an essential manifestation of the talent of the artist and a social response. It is not only philistine but also aberrant to regard them merely as goods or services.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Unfortunately, a coherent, coordinated strategy on the role of culture in the EU’s external actions does not currently exist. As is well known, our interests can be best served when we speak with one voice. Our common foreign policy must be based on cultural diplomacy as Europe’s position in the world can be strengthened through culture, as an integral part of its economic, development and security policies. We will provide a better understanding of our continent by means of distributing films, music and literature. Furthermore, the EU’s diverse cultural landscape gives us the distinction of being the most attractive tourist destination in the world. I welcome the concrete suggestions presented in this report for the involvement of civil society, artists, educators, students and entrepreneurs in shaping the content of external cultural relations. At the same time, we absolutely need to take into account the huge potential offered by new technologies, which are both a source of information and a channel facilitating the freedom of expression. I think that it would be useful for the European Parliament to include culture on the agenda of discussions with other parliaments in the world, in order to help establish a general practice for European external action.</p>

      <p sl="fr">If globalisation has incontrovertibly favoured the proliferation of exchanges, we must fight against the danger of a uniformity of cultures. Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies, counteracting every nationalist reaction, racist temptation and the exclusions that are nourished by the economic and financial, and climate and food crises. Cultures have a calling to enrich one another in a spirit of mutual respect. They are a source of inexhaustible renewable energy. Most of the time, cultural creation describes or expresses a vision, a commitment, a taking of sides that can be pertinent or impertinent. It represents the exercising of a right, including the right to denounce. We have a great need of artists, of their critical view of the world, of their role as the educators of our societies. They anticipate the future and forecast the evolution of society, because they see more quickly and further than politicians. We must work to create a pluralistic world that keeps its aptitude for creation intact and that can give rise to the new and to diversity. We must rethink the system of global governance. We must create a new political space of global dimensions, taking account of the political dimension of cultural diversity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Europe’s cultural riches represent a precious commodity that it is important to preserve. We always hear that cultural diversity must be promoted. We have hitherto been concentrating far too much on promoting cultural diversity via the Muslim immigrant population without ensuring that our own culture, in turn, is recognised in the countries of the Islamic world. If European cultural aspects are to be more prominently included, as is proposed, as an integral part of economic, foreign, security and development policy, it depends on what explicit form this is to be given.</p>
      <p sl="de">Certainly, there is no reason to oppose an exchange of literature, film, music and the like, but the expectations in respect of the Islamic world must not be overly inflated – you only need think of the ban on music, which stems from the Koran. What will be most important is to keep Christian roots in mind and to give greater priority in foreign and development policy to the protection of Christians in other countries, as they are, in the end, the most persecuted minority around the globe.</p>

      <p sl="el">There can be no doubt that cultural diplomacy helps to build trust and cultivate lasting relations between citizens of the EU and citizens of third countries, and there can be no doubt that Europe’s comparative advantage in the culture sector is strong and is therefore a valuable political tool for its foreign policy. New technologies bring new opportunities to spread the European cultural heritage and strengthen transnational ties. As the Internet is a global meeting place, the EU should develop specific policies to promote European culture. The Europeana website is a move in this direction; unfortunately, however, it has not realised its potential as yet. Nor should the contribution of culture to the economies of the European countries be overlooked. It is estimated to account for 2.6% of European GDP at present. Clearly, countries with a rich history, tradition and culture, such as Greece, have nothing to lose by promoting their cultural heritage and values.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report is on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions. I agree with the rapporteur in that we need a common strategy for the cultural dimension. It is not a question of more investment but rather one of better investment. To promote culture is to promote democracy. The proposed coordination may help ensure the more efficient use of resources, especially at a time when budget cuts are being made, particularly in the cultural sector. The existing European Union National Institutes for Culture network should function as an important partner for the sector. The members of this network have significant experience, not only of working in the field, but also of organising cultural activities with appropriate distance from the governments, which is crucial in this sector. In addition to coordination, there is also cultural diplomacy at Member State level. However, there are many third countries seeking to specifically address the European Union and not solely the individual Member States. As such, only a common strategy will prevent the existing fragmentation, which impedes the complete and efficient use of the resources and budgets dedicated to culture. For all these reasons, I voted for this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Culture plays an extremely important role in the European Union, which is an area aiming to be ‘united in diversity’. First of all, we should stress its undeniable integrationist aspect, which enables the existence of shared areas: that is, points at which people with different cultural perspectives find themselves with shared representation. It is no accident that the report’s explanatory statement begins with an interesting citation: ‘Rock and roll, culturally speaking, was a decisive element in loosening up communist societies and bringing them closer to a world of freedom’ (Andras Simonyi). Secondly, the undeniable economic impact that could result from a commitment to disseminating European culture should be stressed. It is, then, a case of disseminating and protecting European values at global level, and of guaranteeing, on the widest possible range of levels, respect for their core aspects, such as freedom of expression on the Internet. Those are the reasons why I am voting in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In voting for the report by Mrs Schaake, I am making a plea for the institution of a genuine European cultural diplomacy in order to promote our values outside the EU. Thinking of culture as a strategic element of foreign policy would, in fact, enable Europe to make up the deficit with regard to certain states. China, in particular, invests heavily in cultural diplomacy to improve its image and attract tourists. Europe must do the same if it is to continue playing a major role on the world stage. This report contains several proposals to achieve this: the proposal to designate a person in every EU representation in third countries, for example, to coordinate cultural relations and interaction between the EU and those countries, or the proposal that the draft European External Action Service (EEAS) organisational chart contain posts tailored to cultural aspects and that a coordination unit be set up. Moreover, it seems opportune that third countries be involved to a greater extent in EU programmes devoted to culture as much as mobility, youth, education and training: the accessibility to these programmes on the part of young nationals of those countries must be facilitated.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report did envisage at first the field of external relations at the EU level almost exclusively under the new media perspectives. This is still quite present, as well as the idea that the EU should export its culture. The Greens insisted on the promotion of ‘cultural cooperation’ instead. Some of the recommendations adopted in the Committee on Culture and Education do not really create something new, like an information website on EU culture programmes and external relations, together with the calendar of EU events in the whole world plus contacts with Civil Society. Some articles, like Article 44 on supporting national efforts to implement the protection and preservation of cultural heritage, illegal trade of heritage or products of cultural creation, do not give much sense to the issue itself. In a nutshell, the report fails really to tackle the issue and assembles bits and pieces alongside the present existing possibilities to put culture on the agenda both for the EU and between the EU and third countries. It is a new chapter in an effort to fully use culture as a tool for peace.</p>

      <p sl="it">The sharing of cultural heritage between individuals is important both within the EU, for the consolidation of a European identity, and in terms of the Union’s relations with third countries. This is why I support strengthening external action in that direction. Resources for culture are often scattered across a host of projects. Efficient use of these funds is further hampered by political fragmentation. We therefore need the European External Action Service to immediately adopt a coherent and unified strategy of cultural diplomacy, including the appointment of an EU special representative to third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I believe that we should increasingly emphasise the use of new technologies, which can increase the number of ways to access cultural content. It is essential for the EU to play a leading role in this context, developing definite policies that can protect the Internet against forms of censure typical of repressive regimes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In 1990, in his book Bound to Lead , the eminent American professor, Joseph Nye, invented the concept of ‘soft power’. What does it mean? Soft power is the capacity an international player has to influence others by non-coercive means, such as cultural dynamism. Why, after a quarter of a century, does the United States remain the superpower that we know it to be? Because, besides its military arsenal, it succeeds in exporting its culture and its ideas and in making them attractive. Europe must do the same; it must defend its cultural model and its values on the international stage. Thanks to this report, the European Union is taking stock of the influence Europe can have if it succeeds in adding a cultural dimension to its diplomacy. I therefore support the recommendations contained in this report. It is the case that, in waiting for the implementation of a genuine common diplomacy and a genuine European defence policy, European soft power and its cultural diplomacy are some of the few means of influence at our disposal.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions. In particular, I would like to stress the necessity of conducting a review of existing programmes with a cultural component and of drafting a Green Paper and a communication from the Commission outlining concrete policies for the role of culture in the EU’s external actions. Currently, cultural cooperation of Member States with third countries takes place on a bilateral basis. There is a lack of shared and coordinated principles and actions, which renders it impossible to make effective use of Europe’s cultural resources and the Union’s creative potential. A common strategy can foster the development of Europe’s cultural resources, the forging and deepening of social relations, the exchange of good practices and improvement of the EU’s cultural position in the international arena. I strongly support inclusion of cultural aspects in the draft organisation chart of the European External Action Service (EEAS). It is also important to provide for the appropriate training of EEAS staff with regard to cultural and digital aspects. Culture is also an important factor in the fight for human rights and the support of democracy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU’s external actions, which affirms that culture must be at the heart of European diplomacy, has been adopted. For all their diversity, Europeans share a great number of strong values, such as respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, which must be extended to the international stage. This ‘brand Europe’ must be borne by true ambassadors. I also welcome the new proposals, such as creating a cultural division within the European External Action Service or the nomination of a ‘cultural attaché’ for every Member State. It is by coordinating national initiatives that a cultural Europe will be able to emerge. The development of new information technologies is making culture accessible to the greatest number. The European Union must, in my opinion, seize this opportunity to assert its cultural uniqueness and encourage creativity.

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this proposal as I believe there is a need for EU-wide momentum to encourage cultural and creative industries (CCIs), which is why they must adopt innovative economic models and have access to new, legal on-line service provision. It is therefore necessary to create a genuine single market for on-line content and services, take specific measures aimed at increasing the role of the CCIs as catalysts for innovation and structural change, bring together actors at regional, national and European level and create new products and services to generate growth and jobs. In Europe, the cultural sector plays a key role and attracts citizens, enterprises and investment, thereby highlighting Europe as a dynamic, stimulating place to live and work. An energetic, growing cultural sector is clearly necessary for Europe’s success as a creative, knowledge-based economy. The cultural sector also attracts well-qualified, creative people.

      <p sl="fr">The cultural and creative industries are crucial for European citizens because of their economic and cultural nature. This is because these industries, as well as participating in the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and the development of a European cultural heritage, also contribute to economic development by stimulating jobs, economic growth and wealth creation. Through this vote, we are clearly committing ourselves to a greater recognition of the cultural sector by emphasising that its potential remains great because it always copes with legal or economic obstacles. In order to increase this potential, therefore, we are proposing concrete solutions such as a pan-European licensing system and the improvement of access to credit and microfinancing. We also note the considerable progress that the Internet represents for our societies, even if it brings new challenges such as guaranteeing access for all and the economic model of the cultural sector. Thus, the European Parliament, which is aware of the crucial role of culture in European society, has made a clear appeal for increasing support for cultural actors.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this report, which aims to acknowledge and enhance the economic and social importance of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs). Focusing EU attention on these industries and organising their potential through a coherent strategy, including funding, meets at least two of the priorities that Lega Nord has always upheld. These are, firstly, the promotion and revival of local cultural heritage, which may be linguistic, musical, architectural or artistic in the broadest sense, in order to safeguard diversity and individuality of intellectual horizons in an age of generalisation, or rather trivialisation and devaluation of the cultural message. Secondly, an institutional commitment to cultural and creative industries would enable talented young people to constructively channel their skills and ambitions, offering them launch platforms, some professional, that would then lead to new job opportunities, while saving them from frittering away their talents in areas that are culturally stagnant or simply unfit for purpose. I therefore support the report in question.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The cultural sector plays a crucial role in Europe and is a source of attraction for ordinary people, businesses and investment, thereby highlighting Europe as a dynamic, stimulating place to live and work. An energetic, thriving cultural sector is clearly necessary for Europe’s success as a creative, knowledge-based economy. The cultural sector also attracts well-qualified, creative people. The cultural and creative industries are currently also important drivers of economic and social innovation in many other sectors. There are states which are already tapping into the multifaceted resources of the cultural and creative industries to a broad extent. However, the European Union still needs to develop a strategic approach to make its cultural assets the basis of a powerful creative economy and a cohesive society. This is a good time for the European Commission’s Green Paper to prompt discussion on unlocking ‘the potential of the cultural and creative industries’, officially endorsing the importance of this sector. The growth of the cultural and creative industries in the European Union since the 1990s has been exponential in terms of job creation and their contribution to GDP.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, addresses how the European Union can unlock the potential of cultural and creative industries (CCIs). This is a debate launched by the European Commission Green Paper at a time when the digital age is invading our lives and globalisation is becoming a challenge for the CCIs. If the EU can create an EU-wide momentum that stimulates these companies by supporting innovation and modernisation, we will be able to promote employment and social cohesion and, as the rapporteur mentions, make the European Union ‘the economy which is founded on the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-base in the world’. I therefore voted for this report, because I believe in the potential of these creative industries and in their promising future. Nevertheless, so that they are not in a position to be overtaken by international partners, there is a need to commit, quickly and firmly, to new technologies – in particular, information technology – and to development and innovation factors. The EU should also support and encourage artistic creation, as well as the mobility of culture professionals, so that it becomes increasingly universal and globalising.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document because unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries necessitates the development, inter alia , of high quality artistic and cultural education, territorialisation, local partnerships, creation and creativity, the sharing of expertise, financing, public/private partnerships and the exchange of good practices. We must create competitiveness between cultural and creative industries (CCIs), whilst bearing in mind the characteristics of each branch and the fact that they require different forms of support. The European Union must introduce measures to support the creative sector. We would like to see this Green Paper having a short and long-term impact through specific developments at European level in such areas as taxation adapted to on-line cultural goods and services and the possibility of exploiting the financing facilities available through the EIB and the EIF. If cultural and creative industries are to maximise their role as a driving force, financing facilities backed up by solid expertise in the characteristics of cultural industries and an adapted taxation system must be introduced. Member States must be strongly committed to protecting and supporting their own cultural heritage. In view of the ever-increasing importance of CCIs, as well as the objective of strengthening this sector, which is of strategic importance for the achievement of the Europe 2020 goals, the Commission should draw up a White Paper which would unlock cultural and creative potential.</p>

I foresee great potential for the CCIs, especially if we consider the possible and necessary cooperation with universities, research centres and art schools, with which we can set up a network of joint training programmes and lifelong learning. It is essential and important, ladies and gentlemen, to disseminate practices and know-how and enhance learning through ad hoc vocational training programmes dedicated to the cultural and creative sector. I think we need to ensure multi-disciplinary teaching programmes and insist on cooperation and partnership not only between educational institutions, students and professionals in the cultural and creative sector, but also between businesses of all sizes, between the public and the private sector, and between craftspeople and financial institutions.</p>

      <p sl="da">The cultural and creative industries contribute in terms of both growth and jobs in the EU. They are part of the plan for meeting the 2020 objectives, and it is therefore important that we create good conditions for this sector – particularly within the area that I would like to highlight, namely copyright.</p>
      <p sl="da">As pointed out in several places in the report, we should, of course, ensure that artists receive fair remuneration for their work. At the same time, it is absolutely crucial that we ensure that a large number of online services are available to consumers. The best way to do this is to create good conditions for legal, operationally sound alternatives. There are currently already several good examples, and they should be made more visible. Creating effective alternatives is the best way to combat piracy. At the same time, it is vital for the Commission to come up with an ambitious proposal on copyright – something that we look forward to with anticipation.</p>
      <p sl="da">One of the things we point out in the report is that a pan-European approach should be taken. It is no good us operating with 27 different systems in this important area. I therefore believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach and look at the connection between licensing, private copyright fees and piracy. I hope that this report can help to get this started and I look forward to an ambitious proposal from the Commission.</p>

At a time when we are faced with major economic challenges, it is important for us to think about ways in which to tap the potential offered by the cultural and creative industries, especially as a significant number of European citizens are involved in such activities. Let us not forget the significant contribution the creative sector makes not only to the development of information and communication technologies, but to economic and social innovation as well. However, this sector raises a number of issues which need to be clarified. One important aspect is the digitisation of cultural productions, along with the need to create a proper single market for online content and services which will generate additional jobs. In this same context, we also talk about resolving the issue of copyright, funding the cultural and creative industries, artists’ mobility or the release of cultural productions.

      <p sl="de">It is doubtful, given the multiplicity of wrong turns taken by the EU, whether information and communications technologies are enough to create a European identity. Just as unconducive to this European identity is the EU’s democratic deficit and the unidirectional understanding of democracy among the Brussels elites, who simply let the populace keep voting until it gives the ‘right’ result. When it comes to direct democracy, the European Union could learn much from Switzerland, which stands up for democratic decisions even when the rest of the politically correct mainstream world criticises it to the hilt. It is doubtful whether, as it is so eloquently put in the report, an ‘energetic, growing cultural sector’ represents an ‘important driver of economic and social innovation’. Rather, a trend can be perceived whereby migration and migrants are being increasingly placed at the heart of support for culture while native culture and tradition are pushed to one side.</p>
      <p sl="de">Yet the much-discussed topic of integration must not take the form of doing without Christmas, Easter, St. Nicholas’ Day and similar traditions in the name of adaptation to Muslim immigrants in our nurseries and schools – to do so would mean the loss of our cultural identity.

      <p sl="pt">The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) make a number of contributions. Firstly, their intrinsic value in the recreation of cultural templates and in contributing to the construction of a common European identity. Secondly, however, they constitute an economic activity that enables the creation of jobs and of products in circulation: in other words, it is a source of wealth in economic terms, too. Nevertheless, there need to be incentives for this type of activity, such as the recognition of the rights to exploit these products economically, whilst fully protecting the position of the creators.

It is therefore crucial from an economic as much as a social viewpoint to support these industries. That is why I am voting in favour of this report. In this way, I should like to encourage Member States and the European Commission to promote both artistic and cultural education among all age groups, from primary education through to higher or vocational education, and the entrepreneurial skills of professionals in the cultural sector, including in the context of lifelong learning. In order to enable the deployment of these industries, it is equally essential to improve access to funding for professionals in this sector: to introduce microfinancing, develop patronage and public/private partnerships, consider introducing new, innovative funding instruments, and train professionals in the banking sector in the specific characteristics of these industries.</p>

In my view, unlocking the potential of creative industries must particularly involve a reform of the European system of managing copyright, in order to enable the creative industries to draw a greater benefit from the single market. Licensing procedures, as the report emphasises, are far too complicated, and it calls for the introduction of a one-stop shop for the clearance of rights. It is also necessary, I believe, to stimulate creation by adopting a specific tax system for innovative products, such as digital cultural content. It is not right that these products should be subject to VAT at the full standard rate while other cultural products benefit from tax reliefs. With my vote, I wanted to call on the Commission and the Council to respond to the European Parliament’s demand for specific measures to enable us to enjoy the full benefit from the growth potential of this sector.

      <p sl="pt">This resolution addresses Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for its capital, Sarajevo, to be considered European Capital of Culture in 2014. The EU initiative ‘European Capital of Culture’ was created to highlight Europe’s cultural richness and diversity, sharing it out and promoting mutual understanding amongst Europeans. In 1992-1996, Sarajevo – the martyr city where, in 1914, the First World War started – would become the victim of destruction during the time it was besieged. It now has images that are known the world over, like the one of ‘The Cellist of Sarajevo’ who, dressed in black and in the midst of the destruction of war, wanders the streets seeking to ease the suffering of a martyred people who cannot leave the city. Despite adversity, the city maintains its cultural spirit. I consider it positive and fair that Sarajevo be European Capital of Culture.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Sarajevo was a magnificent city in which three peoples, three cultures and three religions cohabited. The siege of the city and the ethnic and religious war which lasted for four years (1992-1996) profoundly disrupted this capital, which was ‘Islamised’ in religious terms and ‘Bosniakised’ in linguistic terms. Our challenge now is to rebuild the bridges between the communities. Culture can contribute to this. By the way, it was culture that helped them to endure four years of war. Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies, counteracting every nationalist reaction, racist temptation and exclusion. It can help them now to achieve European multiculturalism once again. This mosaic-like city was and can once more become the living metaphor for Europe. We must work to create a pluralistic world that keeps its capacity for creation intact and that is able to give rise to novelty and diversity.</p>

Sarajevo deserves to be given the chance to demonstrate its huge potential. It is an exceptionally multicultural city. Sarajevo is surrounded by an atmosphere which is both multicultural and European. It is the only city in the world where in an area of one square kilometre, you can see buildings belonging to five religions: there are mosques, a Roman Catholic cathedral, an Orthodox church, a synagogue and a Protestant church.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Bosnians, meanwhile, are characterised by great friendliness and hospitality. I recently read the reminiscences of a Polish student who took part in a student exchange in Sarajevo – she did not meet a single foreign student who was there as part of the exchange who did not like Sarajevo. Since the end of the war in 1995, Sarajevo is also being rebuilt, mainly with financial assistance from the European Union. Sarajevo is looking to its European future with great enthusiasm. It wants to demonstrate its huge potential and promote itself to Europeans. There is no doubt that this city deserves this chance, and we should support it in this.</p>

Sarajevo witnessed important historical events and was severely damaged as a result of the hostilities in the 1990s. It was also the scene of the murder which started the First World War. The 100th anniversary of that event falls in the very year we are talking about – 2014. Awarding the city the title of European Capital of Culture at this juncture would not only help in the cultural regeneration of the city and in improving the city’s image in other countries, but would also help to commemorate important aspects of European history and identity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the brutal war of the Sri Lanka Government against the Tamil minority, at least 40 000 Tamils were killed within the space of a few weeks and hundreds of thousands were detained in open air prison camps. The UN report at long last publicly acknowledges the crimes that were committed against the Tamil people. Unfortunately, there should be no illusions that the report will change the conditions of Tamils in Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p sl="en">The day after its publication, it was reported that the UN Secretary-General would only launch an international investigation if the Sri Lankan Government agrees or an international forum such as the UN Foreign Security Council calls for an inquiry. Given the nature of the Sri Lankan Government, it is obvious that it will not allow any international investigation. It highlights once again the need to campaign for a genuinely independent inquiry into the war crimes and for the Rajapaksa regime to be held responsible.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 18 May, there will be protests around the world organised by many groups, including the Tamil Solidarity Campaign, to mark the second anniversary of this bloody war. A united struggle of Sinhalese and Tamil people is still needed to defeat this regime and fight for the right of self-determination for the Tamil-speaking people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we only have to hear those opening remarks to understand why I very much regret that we are having this debate today. It is being promoted by extremist elements in the Tamil diaspora, the same people who have helped sustain the LTTE terrorist campaign over many years through political activity, and often from the proceeds of crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, the final stages of the LTTE campaign were awful. The UN’s Darusman report, which is the immediate pretext for this debate, states clearly that in those final stages, the LTTE used the civilian population as human shields, intensified the forcible recruitment of civilians, including children, into its ranks, executed civilians who attempted to escape the conflict zone and deployed artillery in proximity to displaced civilians and civilian installations such as hospitals. This does not excuse the shelling of civilian targets, but it does put it into context and shows where the blame lies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Instead of trying to bring together the peoples of Sri Lanka, there are those who seek to continue a campaign of hatred and division. They see this Darusman report as a weapon in this campaign, and just want to put the Sri Lankan Government in the dock.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach is malicious and counter-productive. The government of Sri Lanka and the Commission have set up the LLRC to investigate human rights allegations. Let us do all that we can to support them and the peoples of Sri Lanka, instead of attacking them.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, from the very first words, you have all understood that the debate would be quite lively and that there would be two views.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should say that my group aligns itself neither with one side nor with the other, but simply with the side of justice and of reconciliation. I believe that there can be no reconciliation, in those countries, like Sri Lanka, but there are certainly many others, which have experienced atrocious wars, unless justice is done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Well, what does this United Nations report to which Mr Van Orden refers do? It simply restates the facts and calls for there to be a mechanism for international justice, which one knows must be approved by the government. That is the very least. How would you like there to be reconciliation of a people? It is on both sides, Mr Van Orden. It is not only on the Tamil side. There have been crimes on both sides. Both sides are responsible. It is by both sides that justice must be done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The report also states, and I apologise for this, that the reconciliation commission that has just been mentioned did not have an investigative element of a sufficiently high standard. Finally, I fear that a national organ of justice will not finally result in a clarification of the facts. That is why, quite simply and in the name of all those who have suffered on both sides, I say that this House can only support this report in order to shed more light and have more justice. That is the only message that I should like to pass on today. I shall not have used up all my allotted time, but that is the essential message for this House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on 23 May 2009, the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the President of Sri Lanka, Rajapaksa, signed a joint statement in which Sri Lanka agreed to guarantee accountability for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war which ended in May 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">After this agreement was not honoured by the Sri Lankan Government, the UN Secretary-General appointed a panel of experts to advise him on modalities for an accountability process.

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, the civil war in Sri Lanka lasted 25 years and ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers. The last stages of the war were especially bloody and thousands died in its last few months.</p>
      <p sl="fi">According to the new report by the UN, it is very likely that the Tamil Tigers and government troops will be found guilty of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights committed in the final stages of the conflict. The Tamil Tigers are suspected of shooting civilians trying to flee. The government killed civilians in shellfire. These are both serious crimes and they cannot be ignored. That is why it is important that the UN can carry out an impartial and open investigation into the matter.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Sri Lanka is a ravaged land. The civil war officially ended nearly two years ago, and we know in what conditions it took place. In that country, the United Nations failed badly. The reports from non-governmental organisations are damning. Thousands of civilians were killed between January and May 2009. Atrocities were committed by both camps, but it seems to be accepted that the pro-government forces knowingly shelled zones where they had encouraged the civilian population to take refuge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since that time, the Sri Lankan Government has been manoeuvring to exonerate itself and impede access to justice by those who must be called, at the very least, victims of war crimes. It has not ceased to try and underestimate the number of civilians present in the war zone while it has even deprived them of all humanitarian aid, including food, water and healthcare. The Tamil Tigers have their share of the responsibility for these horrors. They conscripted child soldiers and used the civilian population as a human shield, but that does not in any way alleviate the responsibility of the governmental authorities on the spot. It justifies nothing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The UN waited for a long time before denouncing the situation in that country. What is worse, the Sri Lankan Government has multiplied its machinations to prevent the publication of the latest report in particular and to have its conclusions rejected. We can only welcome the report of 11 April. The resolution before us today is going in the right direction. For my part, I should have liked it to go even further. It is high time that international justice did its work, in Sri Lanka as elsewhere.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the long-running military conflict between the government forces and the armed groups of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which has had very cruel consequences for the civilian population living in the conflict zones, came to an end in 2009. After the end of the war, the Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, promised to investigate all suspected violations of military law and international humanitarian law during the military conflict.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The UN report published in April this year states that both sides in the conflict carried out military operations without taking steps to protect the rights and lives of civilians. Despite this, the responsible bodies in Sri Lanka have not held to account the people responsible for serious violations of humanitarian law, two years after the end of the war. The judicial authorities are, in many cases, inactive, and we therefore need to support through our resolution UN efforts to uphold the law and establish accountability for the killing and torture of thousands of civilians during the vicious fighting between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and government forces in Sri Lanka.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the dramatic events in Sri Lanka which are described in the UN report show what kind of problems can be caused by armed conflict. What took place there is further proof that solving differences by violence and force of arms generates other colossal problems. In Europe, there has, for centuries, been reflection about the concept of a just war. What is particularly painful is the fact that in the modern world, even a war which is theoretically just inevitably entails the suffering of innocent and unjustified victims. This happens irrespective of how we define a just war.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the case of Sri Lanka, growing amounts of data show that the war was not a just one for either side. The victor is not always right, although they always try to prove they are right. If there is really to be a reconciliation, as the Sri Lankan Government has declared, then the basis of such a reconciliation must be the truth about what happened during the struggle with the Tamil Tigers. There will be no genuine reconciliation without exposing the war crimes which were committed, irrespective of which side it was that committed them. There will be no reconciliation if the sides consider their own sins to be taboo and do not allow them to be mentioned.</p>

      <p sl="en">What we are discussing today is a report by the Secretary-General’s panel of experts on accountability in Sri Lanka. I have not heard anyone in the Chamber as yet cast doubts on the intrinsic integrity of that report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have read the report and I have spoken to many about the report on both sides. If we are saying that we should leave the report on the table, and we should not have investigations into what happened between January and May, and indeed not open the door to investigate many allegations on both sides, what is the point of a report of this nature?</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, I find it compelling that one diaspora organisation of the Tamil community, the Global Tamil Forum, has said that credible allegations against the LTTE – and they have made this very prominent – should also be investigated.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have a report which ought to have a follow-up, and I speak firmly in favour of the need for a genuine process of accountability which would bring truth, justice and reconciliation to Sri Lanka following what will be a painful investigation, but an investigation which must happen.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is appalling that during the protracted military conflict in Sri Lanka that ended in 2009, nearly 100 000 people were killed, including tens of thousands of civilians, most of whom died in the final phase of the conflict. The international community should demand a robust international investigation into credible reports of atrocities committed on both sides.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a pity that countries like China and Russia opposed discussion of the issue in the United Nations Security Council and the UN Secretary-General taking more robust action to investigate the crimes committed. The UN Panel of Experts clearly indicated that both the government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil rebels committed serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, possibly amounting in some cases to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>

The UN also said that Tamil rebels had used more than 300 000 civilians as human shields and shot civilians trying to escape. Both sides therefore seriously contravened human rights and international laws in a war situation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is important now that reconciliation talks get under way, so that an impartial and independent investigation into war crimes can be carried out by the UN.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the conclusions from the UN report published on 25 April 2011 level serious accusations concerning the numerous violations of human rights and norms of international law, both by the Sri Lankan Government and by the rebel forces defeated in the civil conflict which lasted well over 28 years. Indeed, the report states that government forces killed tens of thousands of civilians by bombing populated areas, hospitals and even humanitarian aid centres belonging to the UN. On the other hand, the rebel forces used numerous civilians as human shields, with those who tried to escape the conflict zone being shot on the spot. Like other speakers before me, I think that an independent international mechanism needs to be created to investigate the war crimes in this country, as well as the other serious human rights violations. An impartial, transparent investigation is required, which will shed light on who is responsible for these crimes that have shocked the international community.</p>

      <p sl="en">Obviously, we also have to admit that the civilian population is a victim in this kind of conflict, and the UN panel has shown clearly that there are responsibilities on both sides: mainly that of the government but also that of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and both need to be investigated.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are saying is that a proper inquiry is very unlikely if the investigating commission comes from the government. What we are asking for is an independent commission to investigate these allegations, identified by the UN panel, of war crimes and crimes against humanity. If we do not understand the need for this, we will not have a solution, because peace will come only when justice arrives; justice is possible only on the basis of truth; and truth will come only if we have an independent investigation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, finally, Sri Lanka is enjoying peace after a quarter of a century of terrorist insurgency, and the UN report on the Sri Lankan army’s defeat of the Tamil Tigers is heavy on criticism and light on substantive, proven facts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The approach taken in the report seems to be undermining the efforts now undertaken by the government of Sri Lanka to promote truth and understanding, not least through the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, and the government actually having released more than 200 000 detained Tamil prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, any deliberate atrocities against civilians by the military must be punished. I agree with that, but there is no clear evidence that this was deliberate government policy. I would like to remind the House that the LTTE refused a supervised international surrender offer and preferred instead to choose a bloodbath as their kind of exit strategy, which was appalling.</p>
      <p sl="en">The consequences now of the international community’s ambivalence towards Sri Lanka are clear: a loss of influence and an inability to shape developments.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, on 25 April 2011, the United Nations made public the advisory report of the panel of experts appointed by the UN Secretary-General on accountability in relation to the armed conflict in Sri Lanka. The panel found credible allegations which, if proven, would indicate that serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law were committed by the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE, some of which would amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The panel also makes a series of recommendations to the UN Secretary-General and to the government of Sri Lanka which, in the panel’s words, will serve as the framework for an ongoing and constructive engagement between the Secretary-General and the government of Sri Lanka on accountability. Recommendations include the launch of genuine investigations by the government of Sri Lanka and the establishment of an independent international mechanism by the UN Secretary-General.</p>
      <p sl="en">The UN has stated that the UN Secretary-General is carefully reviewing the reports, conclusions and recommendations, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has urged the Sri Lankan Government to quickly carry out the measures suggested by the panel and ensure justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government of Sri Lanka, on its side, has rejected the report in the strongest terms. Earlier this week, High Representative Catherine Ashton issued a declaration on behalf of the EU reiterating the EU view that an independent process to address these extremely serious allegations should contribute to strengthening the process of reconciliation and ensuring lasting peace and security in Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High Representative has stressed that the issue of accountability should be seen as an essential part of the process of national reconciliation. The EU therefore hopes that the government of Sri Lanka will recognise the constructive objectives of the report, and encourages it to engage with the UN Secretary-General on its contents.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended in May 2009 and resulted in more than 90 000 deaths. Numerous Sri Lankans who had been displaced by the violence in their country have returned to their homes following the end of hostilities. However, there are still 75 000 refugees who continue to lead difficult lives in camps in Tamil Nadu, India. Sri Lanka has a double challenge to overcome. It has to recover from a long-lasting crisis. The United Nations’ experts’ report, made public on 25 April, found the allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights credible. In the interests of justice and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, it is essential to set up an impartial, transparent and independent enquiry. It also has to prepare for the various natural disasters, such as flooding, landslides, cyclones and also drought, to which the country is exposed.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Azerbaijan is, regrettably, a one-party, semi-authoritarian state where political opposition to the dynastic rule of the Aliyev family is barely tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last December’s elections predictably delivered an overwhelming majority for Heydar Aliyev’s New Azerbaijan Party. In response, the OSCE stated that the conduct of these elections overall was not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country. The OSCE’s report went on to say that freedom of expression was limited and that normal political discourse was almost impossible, partly because of tight constraints on the media.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we are hearing new reports about the targeting of opposition parties and journalists. This is nothing new, but it is good from time to time in this House to remind ourselves of the true nature of the Aliyev regime. After all, this is a country which, like all EU countries, enjoys membership of the Council of Europe and is part of our eastern EU partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">Supposedly, Azerbaijan is committed to democracy, the rule of law and human rights. The truth is quite different. Azerbaijan spends countless petro-dollars trying to convince outsiders of the benign nature of the regime but I, for one, am not fully taken in.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, while we welcome the release from prison of Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli, the good news about Azerbaijan ends about there. The European Parliament is very concerned about the massive crackdown on freedom of expression and assembly carried out in Azerbaijan following the peaceful protest against the government in March and April of this year. Young people, civil society activists, media professionals and opposition politicians are being harassed and intimidated. Some demonstrators have been sentenced in mass trials which took place late at night and while people did not have access to a lawyer. Most of these lawyers, in turn, were not informed of the locations where the trials were being held. The Human Rights House of Azerbaijan has been closed down by order of the Ministry of Justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">This climate of fear and intimidation and the breaches of human rights must end. The Azerbaijani Government is losing its credibility by breaching conventions it has itself signed up to, such as the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights. We want President Aliyev to keep his word. Europe also loses credibility if we do not act upon these breaches. They should have real consequences for the relations between the EU and Azerbaijan.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, a few days ago, we celebrated the grand opening of Euronest at the European Parliament in Brussels. Azerbaijan is a founding member of that assembly and as such, has committed itself to democracy, human rights, the rule of law and freedom of assembly and the media. This is also a fundamental element of the negotiations on an association agreement between the EU and Azerbaijan that have been taking place since July 2010.</p>
      <p sl="de">In light of this, it is really quite staggering how the Azerbaijani Government has behaved towards peacefully demonstrating people over the last two months. Here we have young people – who organised themselves via social networks like Facebook – arrested and sentenced to up to two and a half years imprisonment because they peacefully demonstrated under the slogan ‘drug abuse’. Others are threatened with a similar fate. At least 30 people, who likewise protested peacefully, have been sentenced to five to eight days of imprisonment without being able to contact their legal representatives in a cloak and dagger operation that excludes the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, that is unacceptable! In a joint resolution of the five largest groups in Parliament, we are calling for all these people to be released immediately and for the rule of law, freedom of expression and of the media to actually be ensured so that, as President Aliyev assured us years ago – in 2005 – ‘No journalist is persecuted in Azerbaijan’. He must finally keep these promises.</p>
      <p sl="de">I really hope that, by the time of the inter-parliamentary assembly scheduled for June, we will succeed in having all these people released, including newspaper editor Eynulla Fatullayev, and that the government and the governing parties finally keep to their promises.

Azerbaijan and other countries in the region need to get a clear signal that violations of human and civil rights cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. If they want to be partner countries of the EU, they must respect its values.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The debate on violations of human rights and democratic standards should therefore cover the entire region of the South Caucasus. In this context, I would also like to draw attention to the re-escalation of tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. This situation now represents a security risk for the entire region. It is therefore important for this reason as well to adopt the resolution now. The Union should take a more active and more responsible approach, not only in Azerbaijan, but also in the whole region.

I think the authorities should understand that peaceful demonstrations are a natural part of political life in any democratic country and that the pluralism of opinions and political beliefs is a fundamental part of a democratic society.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, I must say that it is rather unfortunate that we have put the urgent issues of Azerbaijan and Belarus one after the other – one week after Azerbaijan became – and was welcomed as – a founder of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly together with us, the European Parliament. We need engagement both with the authorities and with civil society, and we have to do more, in addition to adopting urgent measures and resolutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Eastern Partnership and the Euronest Assembly are a good platform for such an engagement, and I feel that there is a new wind coming from Azerbaijan, a renewed wish for political dialogue.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I venture to suggest that were Azerbaijan known as Azeria, as with Georgia and Armenia, European citizens’ concern for democratic standards there would be higher.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, my group cannot share Mr Vigenin’s view. The media in Azerbaijan is not free. Its elections are not fair. Its people are subject to arbitrary and sometimes violent treatment by officials. Peaceful demonstrations in recent weeks have met with repression more common to an Arab than to a European country, from an 18-year-old regime which has slowly stifled hope of progress. This country’s continued participation in the European Neighbourhood Policy must be made conditional on democratic reforms rather than on its willingness to supply oil for the Nabucco pipeline.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law are an integral part of the new association agreement which is currently being negotiated between Azerbaijan and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without respect for these principles, it is impossible to see how Azerbaijan can have a common future with its European partners. Let me also join those colleagues who point out that we need to be very clear and objective when we talk to our partners in the Eastern Partnership countries. We should not believe that we can get away with simply bashing Belarus, because there are severe problems in Azerbaijan and in several other Eastern Partnership countries, and I hope that the forthcoming study commissioned by the Subcommittee on Human Rights will give some guidance on how we should talk to these countries about their human rights situation.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, Azerbaijan is one of the special partners of the EU and a founding member of the Euronest grouping, and therefore benefits considerably from privileged relations with the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As a country with such an exceptional status, however, it has promised, in the signing of mutual agreements as a partner of the EU, to uphold the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are fundamental preconditions for such cooperation. The unjustified arrests of journalists, representatives of youth organisations and civil activists, the banning of peaceful protests and the use of physical force against protestors are therefore unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I expect that the High Representative and Vice President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton, as well as the Commission itself, will convey and represent to the Azerbaijani Government our disquiet over the suppression of democracy in the country, and demand immediate corrective action. By adopting the drafted resolution, we will give both the Commission and the High Representative the necessary mandate for this.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, it is somehow grotesque that our Euronest partners, Azerbaijan and Belarus, are both being discussed in succession here as urgent human rights cases. Surely the partnership ought to require a respect for European values.</p>
      <p sl="fi">According to the human rights organisation, Amnesty International, the Azerbaijani authorities are trying to stifle critical voices with a view to preventing wider protests, the like of which have been seen in the Arab world in recent months. In the past few weeks, the Azerbaijani police have broken up several demonstrations in the country and have also arrested representatives of the opposition on trumped-up charges, frequently, the possession of drugs.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Savalan case and the cases of demonstrators arrested recently show how basic rights in Azerbaijan remain weak and how far the authorities are prepared to silence dissidents.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the situation in Azerbaijan is very disappointing. Here is a country that has not really moved forward in terms of political rights since the break-up of the Soviet Union. There are just too many examples of lack of freedom – freedom of speech and freedom of the press, which are fundamental to any properly functioning democracy – as well as evidence of the torture of prisoners, court cases where illegally acquired evidence is always admitted, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Because we have a close relationship with this country, we certainly have to engage in dialogue, but my position is closer to Mr Watson’s thinking: that we need to take a tough hand as well, because if you go ‘softly, softly’ on a continuous basis, you will get nowhere. So I would hope, yes, for dialogue and, yes, for engagement, but we have to up the ante in terms of making demands for freedom: freedom of expression, freedom of speech and, above all, freedom of the press.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are universal fundamental rights and the cornerstones of a democratic society. It is sad that harassment, intimidation and arrests are used as a means of suppressing the diversity of civil society.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Azerbaijan is party to the European Convention on Human Rights and a member of the Council of Europe, and it has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens’ human rights and respect them. Bloggers, journalists and civil society activists are denied freedom of speech in Azerbaijan and peaceful protests are prevented. Young people are prevented from using new communications technology and social media, and are even punished if they do use them.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is ironical, because the state would definitely benefit from an active and diverse civil society. Azerbaijan should be supported in its democratic and human rights development within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the resolution on Azerbaijan expresses our concern about eventual North African echoes in this, a European partnership country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The leadership there should avoid, in its approaches to the opposition and peaceful protestors, any similarity with the regimes in North Africa, Russia or Belarus. That suggestion and warning can be read in the document before us, certain points of which could express that criticism with more clarity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The wording on the worsening human rights situation and the increased number of incidents should be preceded by the word ‘recently’, as this is not about general developments over the years going from bad to worse. On the contrary, until the spring events, Azerbaijan was making relatively good progress and was not listed by Human Rights Watch among such poorly-viewed states as China, Iraq, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia or Uzbekistan.

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, not only as an active partner of the European Union within the European Neighbourhood Policy and Eastern Partnership, but also as a founding member of Euronest, Azerbaijan must fulfil the commitments it has made to the European Union. This includes having respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as well as for the basic freedoms guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and other international treaties to which Azerbaijan is party. A country aspiring to become a globally recognised democracy cannot operate without allowing its citizens to demonstrate peacefully, especially young people. It is not normal either to ban them from taking their exams just because they hold different political opinions to those of the country’s current leaders.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, there are two faces to modern Azerbaijan. On the one hand, Azerbaijan demonstrates impressive economic growth, which highlights the huge amount of oil, progress in negotiations with the European Union on an association agreement and participation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. On the other hand, there are arrests, press restrictions, in other words, a situation that is dangerously reminiscent of the one in Belarus, which my fellow Members spoke about. I believe that the authorities in Baku must resolve to listen to public opinion, because sitting on the fence is not an option, and the European Union, with all its instruments, should help it choose the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, developments in Azerbaijan regarding democracy and human rights continue to be a matter of serious concern to all of us. Over the last few years, we have noted a worrying trend of increasing restrictions in this domain. Parliamentary elections held on 7 November 2010 were not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are other areas where we believe that Azerbaijan needs to improve its record of meeting fully its Council of Europe and OSCE commitments. First of all, media freedom: overall, there is a lack of media pluralism. There are also reports of harassment of, and violence against, journalists, as well as questionable judicial proceedings against media representatives. Individual cases in this field remain a concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">Freedom of assembly is another area where I am deeply worried. The recent months have witnessed several severe actions taken by the authorities vis-à-vis organised protests, as well as attempts to organise protests inspired by the Arab Spring revolutions. The detention of activists and other repressive measures against protesters are deeply deplorable.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has a responsibility to convey clear messages on the importance of democracy, human rights and respect for the rule of law. Such messages were passed on by President Barroso himself during his visit to Baku in January, and will be high on our agenda for future visits.</p>
      <p sl="en">Human rights and democracy are cornerstones in our cooperation with Azerbaijan under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement. Last year, we established a new Subcommittee on Justice, Freedom, Security and Human Rights and Democracy. Democracy and human rights are also a central theme in our negotiations on a new association agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the willingness of Azerbaijan to discuss these methods. I also welcome the role the European Parliament plays in advocating democratic values to the partners in Azerbaijan, including through its work in the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Committee.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Anyone in Azerbaijan criticising the government is silenced. The European Parliament resolution and reports from human rights organisations highlight serious human rights violations. One such violation which I have drawn the Council’s attention to in a written question concerns the journalist Eynulla Fatullayev, who is still being held in detention, even though a decision was issued by the European Court of Human Rights for him to be released. I pointed this out then and I now urge the removal from the Criminal Code of the provisions concerning defamation, slander and insult (Art. 147-148). A recent report about Azerbaijan from Transparency International indicates that the government is not taking measures to combat corruption and that the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed. Furthermore, the authorities responded to the recent protests which took place on 11 March and 2 April with arrests and harassment. Democracy is based on people’s freely expressed desire. I call on the Council and Commission to urge the authorities in Azerbaijan to respect human rights, especially those relating to the freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration, as well as to take concrete measures to combat corruption and reform the justice system. The European Union must support all those who risk their lives and freedom in this country for the values which we share.</p>

      <p sl="it">Azerbaijan actively participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is one of the EU’s six Eastern partners, and is among the founders of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. The core values of these three initiatives are respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. These initiatives are intended to foster a continuous political dialogue that can deepen ties between member countries and enable Europe to accompany them along the path to reform. We believe that the instrument of the emergency resolution may be inadequate or even counterproductive to the achievement of the desired goal, namely, Azerbaijan steadily progressing towards its objectives of full and modern democracy. The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Once again, we are calling attention to the question of free speech and freedom of the press and to the general policy of treating journalists in Azerbaijan. Reports from a variety of sources indicate that the situation of journalists and every kind of political activist in Azerbaijan is becoming increasingly difficult. As far back as 2005, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger. The facts reveal, however, that those words are just an empty promise.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular importance to me. In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly hindered from fulfilling their basic role – the reliable and credible provision of information. It is unacceptable that journalists are carrying out their work under the threat of arrests and body searches. The Azerbaijani authorities have to realise that the activity of free and independent media is a clear signal to the international community that a country is a credible partner on the world stage.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The message given by the European Parliament should be clear – the benefits of economic cooperation with the European Union must not obscure expectations regarding the need to move towards European standards of respect for fundamental human rights, in particular, free speech and freedom of the press, which are a pillar of democracy and without which it is impossible for a modern democratic society to exist.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, in evaluating, we must not forget that, just as we try to make an objective evaluation in our own countries, our partners or neighbours deserve exactly the same approach.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to say as a doctor that violence is still violence, wherever it happens. It is contrary to our shared values. We must try to ensure that those who are currently in prison are provided with proper conditions from the perspective of health and dignified treatment, wherever they are in the world.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The newly established Euronest assembly should serve as an instrument of exchange and cooperation. In the case of Belarus, it is not possible to fulfil this aim in its entirety due to the measures adopted. The overall outcome of the decision means a breach of the Prague Declaration and a slowdown in potentially positive developments concerning mutual cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Our efforts are directed towards the creation of the single Europe which young people most of all deserve, including those in Belarus. We should therefore reconsider our position, and reconsider whether restrictions are the right instrument for leading civil society in Belarus to see us as a true friend.</p>
      <p sl="cs">In connection with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, I would like to ask you to try and see Belarus through a different lens, as a country that has suffered greatly. The disaster particularly affected Belarus and, in my opinion, it is an insult to this nation to prevent the people of Belarus from participating in the official act of remembrance.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I should like to address one further remark to Mr Tannock. I know how hard it is to speak quickly in English. I love English as the language of Shakespeare. Next time, try to speak quickly in the language of Johann von Goethe, and perhaps we will understand you better. I say that as a Czech.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, in the five months since 19 December, the political atmosphere in Belarus has become dramatically worse. There is increasing repression of the democratic opposition, the free press and civil society. Belarus is also violating international treaties. I was always in favour of dialogue with Minsk, but under current conditions, it is becoming very difficult, if not impossible. All the more so, because arbitrary accusations addressed to the European Union are also coming out of Minsk, even harassment. The resolution calls for new measures to be found to help Belarusian civil society and the opposition, and this is only fair. Perhaps it is an illusion, but I think that even Moscow and Kiev could help by talking to Minsk about the release of political prisoners.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, in the previous debate, I, too, along with a number of fellow Members, alluded to the session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly held last week which the Belarusian MPs were absent from, as you are aware. Their absence is justified because MPs in Minsk are not elected freely. In addition, the human rights situation in this country remains more than critical.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that we were all appalled by the repressive measures taken against the protesters in December. At the moment, six of the seven candidates who stood against President Lukashenko are still being tried and harassed. Many other people, including these candidates’ staff, are in prison simply for participating.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that two important things need to be done:</p>

      <p sl="en">We are grateful to the Council for reintroducing visa sanctions and an asset freeze on the high Belarusian officials, which demonstrated that our deep concern for the people of Belarus is not only empty rhetoric. Perhaps we have not been clear enough. Therefore, we are calling on the European Union to extend restrictive measures against Lukashenko’s regime. Well-advised, targeted, economic sanctions against state-owned enterprises will have an effect that the Belarusian authorities cannot disregard.</p>
      <p sl="en">The criminal regime of Lukashenko relies greatly on the income from exports of chemicals, heavy industry and textiles owned by state enterprises. By cutting off the European market, we can demonstrate our determined intention to overthrow Lukashenko’s regime. It is within our capacity to make a difference. Regime transition is desperately needed for the people of Belarus. We should not deny them their long-awaited liberty.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we are talking about politics and about human rights in the context of Belarus. I would like, today, to adopt a somewhat unconventional approach and recall the names of two people who are connected with this subject. One of them is my friend, Anatol Lyabedzka, a wonderful Belarusian and European, who only recently was released from prison after spending over 100 days under arrest, something which I am profoundly convinced was unlawful. Today, I would like to send him expressions of solidarity from this House – from the majority of MEPs, I am sure – because he is someone who definitely deserves this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second person I would like to mention is Andrzej Poczobut, a journalist who writes for Gazeta Wyborcza, one of Poland’s largest newspapers. I and hundreds of thousands of Poles would like to appeal for his release. He, too, is currently under arrest, and he, too, is being persecuted simply because the Lukashenko regime is afraid of free speech – it is afraid of free speech, which is the foundation of every democracy. I think that we Europeans, assembled in this Chamber today, have no option other than to say very loudly: ‘yes’ for a free Belarus, ‘yes’ for democracy in Belarus and ‘yes’ for the Belarusian nation in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the situation in Belarus is indeed deteriorating, literally from one day to the next, in both political and economic terms. From the political point of view and in terms of civil liberties, we are seeing trials being started against the main opponents of Alexander Lukashenko in the last presidential elections, and we can see the scandalous procedure being applied in these trials. We are also witnessing the repression of independent media, including, in particular, the fact that Andrzej Poczobut has been detained for many weeks now. The economic deterioration can be seen in the redenomination of the rouble, the financial crisis and the problems with current payments. In addition, Alexander Lukashenko is losing control, not only over the situation in the country, but also over his own behaviour, which can be seen in the astonishing, shocking and offensive statements made in reference to the President of Ukraine and Mr Barroso.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, Commission, Council, it is time to stop the words and the appeals – it is time for action. Paragraph 8 of our resolution says clearly: it is time to introduce economic sanctions, because this is the only language which Lukashenko understands. If, today, we bring in economic sanctions, we can expect that the scandalous trials and the scandalous repression will finally end, because it is only this language which Lukashenko understands. It is, therefore, time to move to another and more resolute phase of reaction to what is going on in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="de">Belarus keeps on violating all fundamental rights and civil liberties. Over the past month, we have seen the Belarusian authorities repeatedly demonstrating their disdain and contempt for the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly and expression.</p>
      <p sl="de">We could talk here about the matrix of the unchangeability of Lukashenko and his regime, but we cannot end on that pessimistic note. We should understand that a proper response would be a signal to Belarusians – to the Belarusian nation – that they are welcome in Europe, with, at the same time, pressure on the regime and some very principled words about their violation of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must not be misled by Lukashenko’s occasional making up to the European Union just to infuriate Russia temporarily, or vice versa. This is unacceptable. What is happening in Belarus has to be evaluated in a very principled way, and more pressure has to be applied.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, we have talked in this Chamber about what is happening in Belarus on average once every two months since the beginning of the year – this is now the third time. We have talked about cases of human rights violations, we have mentioned the names of opposition activists who have been put in prison and we have discussed how the ability of many civil and non-governmental organisations to operate is restricted. We should, indeed, condemn all these matters and we should protest very strongly against them. However, I think it is equally important, and perhaps even more important, for there to be specific and real involvement from the European Union in building civil society, providing financial support for non-governmental organisations and free media, and also in imposing economic sanctions. As for economic sanctions, I think the right moment has come and that we should introduce them as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, we are going to vote on a resolution which is intended to give moral support to Belarusian society. In my opinion, this should be followed by specific measures, including financial measures and economic sanctions, which will allow the restoration of freedom and democracy in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two questions came to my mind during our discussion about the human rights situation in Belarus. The first one: what would you say if, one or two years from now, you were to see one of the members of the current Lukashenko government here in the European Parliament, in a place none other than the Vice-President’s chair of the LIBE Committee in charge of civil liberties and human rights? And my second question: when will we get to the point where, on these Thursday afternoon discussions, I will see on the agenda amongst non-EU countries the United States or Israel, for instance, particularly since we are already continuously discussing their human rights situations?</p>
      <p sl="hu">Let me mention a few additional details regarding these two questions in the remaining two minutes: There was the issue of the member of the Lukashenko government. Ladies and gentlemen, Kinga Göncz, member of the government of the Hungarian Lukashenko, Ferenc Gyurcsány, presides in the Vice-President’s chair of the LIBE Committee, and is lecturing the representatives of Italy, France and other democracies about human rights.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What was it exactly that made this Hungarian Lukashenko, Ferenc Gyurcsány, famous? The same things, and, to a certain extent, even more pronounced, that this report here is listing in relation to Lukashenko and Belarus to which you are raising an objection, setting the bar considerably higher for Lukashenko and Belarus, a country outside of the European Union, than the one you were using for Hungary and Ferenc Gyurcsány, including the fact that the Hungarian Lukashenko forcefully broke up every significant anti-government protest. I myself have now received compensation and an apology from the police for having shot me, a European Parliament candidate, point blank in the face with tear gas. The most stupefying fact is that there are people still in prison today, some of them serving final prison sentences and some under preliminary detention, who were leading figures of the anti-government protests.</p>
      <p sl="hu">My other question pertains to the United States. They have the death penalty as well, and the torture inflicted in Guantánamo is the same as in Belarus, to which you are objecting. Could it be that someone is intent on getting their hands on the national assets of Belarus? Is not this the reason for this country being randomly selected, especially in view of the fact that you are threatening to use sanctions against its national assets and state-owned companies?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am not often of one mind with Mr Maštálka, but today I am. Firstly, I would like to say that all the parties need to fight for democracy and the rule of law to finally prevail in Belarus. Secondly, I want to make the case for multilingualism. Like him, I come from a mini-Europe, the former Habsburg Empire, which was no bad thing in many regards, but which fell apart because the biggest linguistic group – namely mine, the German speakers – always insisted on everyone speaking German. That meant the end of a multinational community. Charles, I hold you in a very high regard, but we are here for multilingualism and precisely for the rights of the minor languages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to Belarus, I want to say that, 20 years ago, Croatia and Slovenia became free countries – I was there – and in the August, the Baltic States, Russia and Ukraine followed. Nobody would have thought that, 20 years later, there would still be a dictatorship in Europe. Unfortunately, there is not only one. There is Belarus, there is a trend towards a dictatorship in Russia, there is a sliding backwards in Ukraine and there are problems in Moldova and Transnistria. We need to see, therefore, quite simply, that our entire eastern neighbourhood is facing a threat to its freedom to varying degrees. We therefore need to be very clear, think strategically and make freedom and the rule of law the yardstick for our relations throughout our eastern neighbourhood, and particularly when it comes to Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I will begin on a personal note. The organisation Libereco Partnership for Human Rights has asked me to take over a prisoner’s godparenthood for an opposition activist imprisoned in Belarus. I have been asked to adopt Dmitry Bandarenka. I would like to suggest that all of you who are involved in these matters could ask this organisation to allow you to take on the personal patronage of repressed Belarusians and their families – this would be something of a response to the problem of what we can do for those who are, in fact, not far away, in a country which shares a border with the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I am sure that all of us support strong and clear steps. It has already been said in this Chamber that there must be sanctions and there must be strong words, because we can only talk to Lukashenko using a language he understands – well, he understands the language of his own interest, and he understands the language of strength. To rescue human rights, and to rescue democracy, we must use a language which is understood in Minsk.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have the impression that although we have already spoken many times about this in this Chamber, not much has come from these words of ours. This is, of course, an appeal both to this House and to all bodies and institutions of the European Union, but it is also a challenge which I propose that you take back to your countries and national governments, because they have at least the same power to persuade Mr Lukashenko to establish democracy and freedom in Belarus as we do as representatives of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, following the elections in December, President Lukashenko of Belarus began purposely to crush the already weak political opposition and the independent media.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Around 40 people who had taken part in the demonstrations following the elections were charged with civil disorder, which can carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment. The anti-democratic power in Belarus is concentrated very much in the President.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Lukashenko is now in his fourth term of office, and for 16 years, he has shown that his moves in the direction of democracy are just a very cynical game. The restrictions on Belarus imposed by the EU are therefore fully justified and should even be stepped up.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I strongly support the call issued yesterday by Parliament to the International Ice Hockey Federation for Belarus to lose its right to host the 2014 World Championships unless it frees all its political prisoners. The EU should also impose targeted economic sanctions and intensify its support for NGOs in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the international community, which also includes the European Union, has been appealing to the Belarusian authorities for a long time to respect the international commitments which they have assumed, to stop the repressive measures used against opposition representatives, to free the protesters arrested during various demonstrations, to end the repressive measures against the free press, civil society and human rights activists, and to allow fair, transparent trials to be conducted. The Belarusian authorities need to understand that if they fail to respect human rights and the rule of law, in compliance with the joint declaration made at the Eastern Partnership Summit on 7 May 2009, of which the Belarusian Government is also a cosignatory, the European Union will not be able to offer any commitment of support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I will be talking about Belarus and not Hungarian domestic politics. It is 20 years since the Soviet Union collapsed, but for President Lukashenko of Belarus, it is as if nothing has changed at all. Political repression is as rife as it ever was in the Soviet days, and Lukashenko’s secret police – provocatively still called the KGB – are used as its enforcers.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we remember from the post-election protests in December last year, Lukashenko is intolerant of dissent and seems to take pleasure in using violence and intimidation against pro-democracy activists. As this resolution today illustrates in graphic detail, Lukashenko has intensified his campaign for persecution and harassment against those who dare challenge his iron-fisted rule. We call on him to end this futile crackdown, to release all political prisoners and instead to restore Belarus to the path of genuine, pluralist, multi-party democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">At last week’s constitutive session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, representatives from Belarus were rightly missing. Belarus is the missing piece of Europe’s democratic jigsaw puzzle, and I long for the day when it rejoins the European family.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, I fully support the insistence of the European Parliament and of the Members present that human rights not only in the European Union, but also throughout the whole of the world, are fundamental rights, namely, the foundations of life. However, I do not support broadly charging a country (without citing any specific examples), its leader or all of its people with crimes that they have not committed. If we are talking about the fact that someone in the opposition (and not only from the opposition, but others too) is arrested after certain events, and see in that circumstance some sort of dictatorship, then what is the purpose of courts in a democratic system? Let the courts deal with whatever happened there, and with who has been rightly and wrongly sentenced or arrested. The fact that you belong to the opposition is not yet grounds for allowing you to do whatever comes into your head. I ask for an extremely tolerant and balanced attitude towards everyone.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned about the situation in Belarus and particularly the developments in the wake of the violation of electoral standards at the presidential elections on 19 December 2010.</p>
      <p sl="en">The crackdown is now further intensifying, with a number of ongoing trials against ex-presidential candidates and most of the remaining detained activists. At the same time, proceedings are ongoing which could result in the closure of two of the remaining independent newspapers – Nasha Niva and Narodnaya Volya – and the harassment of the political opposition, civil society and the independent media continues.</p>
      <p sl="en">Vice-President/High Representative Ashton has made a number of general and specific statements on the situation in Belarus. We have in clear words condemned the deteriorating situation and have repeatedly called upon Belarus to end the ongoing crackdown on the political opposition and civil society, release all political prisoners and discontinue the politically-motivated trials. We have also expressed our grave concern at reports of torture and other forms of ill-treatment, intimidation and court irregularities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also remind you that in January, the Council adopted restrictive measures comprising a travel ban and an asset freeze. The list now comprises 175 individuals – which should be compared to the 40 names put forward for an asset freeze and visa ban after the 2006 elections – and we stand ready to include further names, as warranted by developments. In addition, we are considering options for further possible measures, including on the economic side.</p>
      <p sl="en">In our messages, we have made it clear that we want to continue our engagement with the Belarusian people and civil society. We are moving ahead on the issue of visa facilitation. Negotiating directives for visa facilitation and readmission agreements were adopted by the Council on 28 February, and we are encouraging Member States to make optimal use of the existing flexibilities offered by the Visa Code, in particular, the possibility of waiving and reducing visa fees for certain categories of citizens. In terms of assistance, the Commission is quadrupling its assistance to the Belarusian population and civil society.</p>
      <p sl="en">We remain committed to a policy of critical engagement in Belarus. This was made clear by the 31 January conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council. At the same time, it is clear that any deepening of our bilateral relations will depend on Belarus proving its willingness to respect the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, let me say that the situation in Belarus remains high on our agenda. I am glad to see that a large majority in this Parliament is committed to continuing a serious debate about this and to resisting distractions. We shall continue to monitor developments closely, and we stand ready to react as appropriate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">For a long time, we have been witnesses to the European Union’s political impotence in the face of the tragic situation in Belarus. Successive appeals and resolutions have not been effective. The heavy-handed rule of Alexander Lukashenko gags the opposition, convicting its leaders and sending them to prison and to what are called ‘penal colonies’. In this context, one need only mention the names of opposition presidential candidate Andrei Sannikau, whose trial began a month ago, and Mikalai Statkevich, who is being held under arrest by the KGB. What has the Union done to secure their release? The key to a successful revolution in Belarus is Russia, which has always been an ally of the regime. It would, therefore, be a good idea at the next meeting with the leaders of the Kremlin to stop talking about a common zone of European security from the Atlantic to the Urals, as the leaders of France and Germany want, and to take up the real challenges which lie just over our border. The economic crisis in Belarus is the best time for change. All international aid should be made dependent on democratic change in Belarus.</p>
