      <p sl="en">Mr President, the main purpose of this debate is to trigger an exchange of views in plenary regarding the powers of Parliament and the Council as a result of the Lisbon Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty provides additional powers in the area of fisheries to the European Parliament under Article 43(2), and the establishment of long-term multiannual plans is a core pillar of the reform of the common fisheries policy. We must find a solution together with the Council for all future management plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to horse mackerel, the management plan for horse mackerel is based on the implementation plan agreed by the Commission at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. At the summit the Commission agreed to maintain or to restore the stock to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield. The subsequent proposal by the Commission was drafted in close cooperation with the Pelagic RAC, which had originally put forward a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Egg surveys for horse mackerel have been conducted every three years since 1977. However, the data collected was insufficient to allow scientists to make a full assessment of the health of the stock. The proposed management plan addresses these difficulties by establishing a formula for vessels in the horse mackerel fishery known as the Harvest Control Rule. This rule provides a mechanism for calculating an additional ceiling of maximum allowable landings of horse mackerel harvested from the defined area. The plan was expected to come into operation in 2009 but was delayed by the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty. In November 2010 Parliament adopted my report by an overwhelming majority: 651 in favour and 15 against.</p>
      <p sl="en">There were two principal issues which proved to be contentious when Parliament reviewed the dossier in 2010. Parliament overturned a previous decision to split the stock into two zones, separating area 8C located in the Bay of Biscay. It was correct to do so, as the scientific advice is clear on this matter: this is one stock which covers the entire geographical area. So as a compromise an amendment was adopted which states that the plan shall be implemented, taking into account artisanal fisheries and historical rights. This amendment was acceptable to the Council at the time and to the Pelagic RAC.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other contentious issue referred to the Harvest Control Rule. In 2010 I met with representatives of the Belgian Presidency prior to the adoption of the report by the Committee on Fisheries. The Presidency suggested a proposal which provided the Council with a degree of flexibility in terms of the total removable amount when setting the total allowable catch in relation to the Harvest Control Rule. The proposal put forward by the Belgian Presidency was subsequently adopted by this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there are varying views between Parliament and Council on the Harvest Control Rule. However, the legal advice from our services is very clear. Multiannual plans are a fundamental and core aspect of the fisheries conservation tool provided for under EU law, and must be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure via Article 43(2). Regrettably the Council is yet to adopt the first reading. However, I understand that the Danish Presidency is currently pursuing a proposal put forward by their predecessors before Christmas.</p>
      <p sl="en">The delay has forced the committee to raise this matter in frustration in plenary, and hopefully progress can be made. I appreciate that all parties are working together in good faith in an effort to progress on this important dossier.</p>
      <p sl="en">In recent weeks informal contacts have commenced once more with the Council, which I welcome. I hope that all three institutions will take a pragmatic and a sensible attitude going forward. I believe that this will enable us hopefully to have trialogues and a second reading. I shall do all possible, in conjunction with the shadow rapporteurs, the Fisheries Committee, the Commission and the Council, to reach a satisfactory conclusion which may not necessarily – and I repeat that, may not necessarily – create a precedent for other management plans.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I now don for one minute my Irish cap, as I have dealt with my position on fisheries? I want to refer to the haddock quota. I take the opportunity to raise an extremely important matter which has emanated from the December Council meeting where the ministers agreed to a 200% increase in the haddock quota in area 6A off the North-West.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been an explosion of haddock, so Annex 3 to the Council Conclusions calls on the Commission by emergency measures to adopt the necessary catch composition requirement by mid-February to allow the fishermen to avail themselves of an increased haddock quota. It appears, however, that trawling will be the only fishing gear that may be used, and many of the small in-shore and small island and coastal vessels use gillnets which are more environmentally-friendly than any other type of gear. I therefore appeal to the Commissioner to use her influence to ensure that gillnets will be permitted under the emergency measure. Otherwise an amendment to the technical conservation measures regulation will be needed which will have to go through the co-decision procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I refer to the concept of regionalisation. Measures such as the approval of gillnets are a prime example for regionalisation. These decisions must in future be taken at local level and not national level. In relation to the other matter, I confirm that we will work closely together to try and move on within the next number of weeks or months.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, please believe me when I say that, with this being my first speech before this House as chair of the Committee on Fisheries, I would rather not have had to make it, because we are not only going to talk about fishing, total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas – although these are very important – but also issues of jurisdiction.</p>
      <p sl="es">The question I asked on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries relates to the Treaty of Lisbon and how it should be applied in the area of fisheries policies, and, as I said previously, this goes much further than an isolated discrepancy. It concerns the undertaking by the three institutions – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to accept the rules of the game that we agreed upon, based on the premise which underlies the Treaty: to take appropriate decisions, each according to its responsibilities, in the interests of the citizens of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is no doubt that the new Treaty has made major changes to the decision-making process for fisheries policy, and understandably it is going to take time to make the necessary adjustments to ensure that the new procedures operate correctly and in full. However, unfortunately we have learned from experience in the two years since the Treaty came into force that the Council and, in some cases, the Commission continue to deliberately – or so I believe – put up obstacles in an attempt to prevent Parliament from exercising its new prerogatives. This is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament cannot accept under any circumstances that the Council should continue to operate as if nothing had changed, as if Parliament were a mere bystander and the Treaty of Lisbon and the new division of competences had never existed. Minister, Commissioner, whether you like it or not, Parliament cannot be excluded from making decisions on fisheries policy, whether internal or external. These are not my words, they are the Treaty’s.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now, once again, following the Commission’s proposal, the Council has sought to exceed the scope of Article 43(3) of the Treaty, quite unacceptably in our view, in an attempt to exclude Parliament’s voice from the decision-making process.</p>
      <p sl="es">The procedure laid down in this article clearly refers to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, that is, decisions on TACs and quotas, and to these two aspects alone – not to a whole series of other measures for achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy, which would be covered by Article 43(2).</p>
      <p sl="es">As is stated in the preamble to the question, technical measures, such as prohibition or restricted zones and periods, restricted fishing depths and specific requirements related to fishing gear can in no way be interpreted as falling under the remit of Article 43(3).</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament’s position is quite clear. We have been stating it for some time now: you cannot take a broad interpretation which is in clear contradiction with any exceptional status. Our reaction, in various dossiers, has always been to seek proportionate measures. We clashed over the Venezuela–French Guiana dossier, when the Council decided to forge ahead without Parliament’s consent. We had no alternative than to go to the European Court of Justice. Also when we opposed the Council’s blocking of long-term plans for hake and anchovy; we disagreed and we chose the first reading to try to negotiate seriously with the Council for a second reading.</p>
      <p sl="es">In terms of TAC and quota regulations we have been even more tolerant, if that is possible. It has not escaped our attention that what was adopted in 2010 and 2011 – in both cases on the basis of Article 43(3) – was done incorrectly. We continued to insist that sufficient time should elapse before the Council and the Commission could take joint decisions and were operating correctly. However, now of course we realise that in this case they are introducing a recital on certain conditions, functionally linked to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities, when clearly the concept of associated conditions, formerly covered in Article 20 of the Regulation, has been explicitly omitted from the new Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Members of the European Parliament thought that we should allow some time to elapse. However, we are – and I say this clearly – most disappointed because in 2012, three years after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, there are still major discrepancies between what the Commission proposes and what the Council approve, on the one hand, and what the Regulation states on the other. In my view, neither institution has given any indication that it is willing to abandon this broad interpretation of Article 43(3) for once and for all, and adopt another procedure that is more respectful of Parliament’s prerogatives.</p>
      <p sl="es">To conclude, there is unanimity among groups, coordinators and all the Members. We have made our approach very clear in our oral questions and I would like the Commission and the Council to answer the questions we have put to them today just as clearly.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, it is in the context of the reform of the CFP that this question for oral answer is being asked on a resolution on the contribution of the common fisheries policy (CFP) to the production of public goods.The reform should start considering a holistic understanding of fishing and also of the crisis in Europe, which requires the contribution of all social and professional sectors, including fishing, if it is to be effectively overcome.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The objectives of this motion for a resolution are clear. The first is to demand recognition for the multifunctional nature of fisheries. This involves raising awareness that fishing is not merely the traditional activity of extraction, processing and trade since, on top of these aspects and their socioeconomic value, fisheries also play an important role in terms of, inter alia , history, culture, recreation, science, energy, the environment and education. It thus produces public goods to which society is entitled and which should be taken into account for CFP funding.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A second objective is to put forward the notion of conditionality; that is, positive discrimination for anyone providing proof that they have implemented best fishing practices, whether in the fishing gear used, the rejection of illegal fishing, or in efforts to reduce by-catch. A further effect of this measure will therefore be to make ship owners and fishermen work more closely together on surveillance and monitoring procedures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">A third objective is to demonstrate how fishing itself, and as part of a wider maritime policy, contributes to the Rio+20 Summit goals of job creation and poverty elimination, and to the Europe 2020 strategy, promoting smart, sustainable and inclusive growth through its increasingly scientific basis, ecosystem structuring and professional training. Only this renewed, holistic, modern conception of fishing can turn it into a true engine of development, which is slowly reaching the coastal areas of the Member States surrounded by sea, such as Portugal, and maritime regions like islands and, in particular, the outermost regions, such as the Azores. We cannot demand anything less of the upcoming reform.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what are we dealing with here today? We are trying to adopt multi-annual plans for our fishing stocks in order to bring an end to overfishing in our seas.</p>
      <p sl="de">Multi-annual plans are the key tool in our fisheries policy. The fish in question today, the Atlantic horse mackerel, is just one example of many. We aim to produce management plans for all commercially fished species. Almost exactly 16 months ago, we were here in the House and Parliament adopted its position on this multi-annual plan. We have had the attempt to negotiate with the Council. Unfortunately nothing came of the talks, as the fisheries ministers within the Union apparently would like to work without involving Parliament when it comes to important issues. Over the past 16 months, the Council has not budged an inch. It has demonstrated complete obstinacy, a quality that is not a bad one to have in politics, but in this case it is scandalous. The Council has ensured that there are absolutely no new long-term management plans in place. It is as if the tug of war between the institutions were more important than a sensible policy for our fishermen, for our environment and for our citizens. If we want people to be satisfied with the European Union, we must deliver results. In the area of fisheries policy, we have not done that for two years now.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the past, European fisheries policy was in the sole hands of the Council of Ministers. Unfortunately, the result was a disaster. That the ministers should now have the idea of continuing to make policy without Parliament’s involvement seems, against that backdrop, to be something of a bad joke! If we were to actually negotiate with one another about the reform of the common fisheries policy the citizens of the European Union would also observe who was going into bat for a progressive policy and who was putting the brakes on.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ministers, please take a look at yourselves and then manoeuvre yourselves out of this dead end as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the common fisheries policy has tremendous significance and impact on local fishing communities as a common good. Tradition, culture and the passing down of the fishing profession through the generations have been features of European history since time immemorial. Fishing is one of the oldest economic activities undertaken by humankind and its importance goes beyond economic considerations. To date, implementation of the common fisheries policy has been an overwhelming disaster, not only as regards the environment, since stocks are not at the level they should be, but also in terms of protecting the fishing sector and communities, which now find themselves in a particularly difficult situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Special attention should be paid to small-scale fishing because of its cultural and social value, and also because it is a source of income for small family undertakings that create many jobs on the labour market. In certain parts of Europe fishing is the only source of income and the only way of providing for families. In my view, the future of small-scale fishing is uncertain and gives rise to many concerns, for example the sale of individual fishing quotas. Another very important factor is competitiveness. When this amounts to setting small-scale fishing against huge processing conglomerates, together with unrestricted liberalisation of the market, it heralds a bleak future. What is most important, however, is handing traditions down through the generations and passing on the knowledge, skills and spirit that are integral to the fishing profession. I should like to ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take to make fishing a more attractive profession, and what strategy she plans to adopt to encourage the younger generations to take it up.</p>

    <intervention id="2-013-000" speaker_id="96706" name="João Ferreira" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, in addition to the strategic importance of the fisheries sector for the public fish supply and for the food balance of the Member States, it also contributes significantly to the socio-economic welfare of coastal communities, local development, employment, and the maintenance and creation of economic activities and jobs both upstream and downstream of fishing itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union common fisheries policy has thus far neglected the importance of the multi-functional nature of the sector and, with it, the so-called ‘production of public goods’. The deep economic and social crisis that affects the fisheries sector, – the result of a policy whose central tenet has in many cases consisted merely of the indiscriminate decommissioning of vessels – is jeopardising the release and full use of the sector’s huge potential in numerous areas, including the economic, social, historic-cultural, scientific, educational and environmental, among others.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The question, Commissioner, is whether the current reforms proposed for the CFP will contribute to changing this picture or whether, on the contrary, they will maintain it or even aggravate it. Unfortunately, the signs so far from the Commission are not only discouraging, but worrying. The defence of an increasingly market-oriented CFP and the progressive removal of public support structures – the overall philosophy that inspires the reforms – ignores the fact that the market does not recognise, or remunerate as it should, many of the so-called ‘positive externalities’ at a social and environmental level for which parts of the fleet that are less competitive from a strictly economic viewpoint are responsible.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the general context of the fisheries sector, small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing, segments that make up the bulk of the industry in many Member States, are known to be of particular importance for multi-functionality and the production of public goods. Yet the importance of this segment of the fleet is not sufficiently recognised by the Commission proposal. On the contrary, the Commission uses a definition of small-scale fishing that is reductive and disconnected from reality, at the same time that it proposes a modification of the CFP management system based on the creation, mandatory in all Member States, of a system of transferable individual concessions that is likely to seriously damage small-scale coastal fishing and artisanal fishing and, with them, the multi-functionality of the sector and the production of public goods.</p>
      <p sl="pt">If this system goes ahead, and we will do everything in our power to ensure that it does not, not one, I repeat, not one of the safeguard clauses already proposed by the Commission will prevent the inevitable concentration of the activity among operators with greater economic and financial might, firstly on a national scale, and then inevitably, sooner or later, on a European scale. It would be yet another significant factor in the decline of numerous fishing communities dependent on fishing.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are trends that must be halted and reversed. There are other paths, alternative paths that will make it possible to reverse the decline of the sector and lead the way towards the full use of its tremendous potential. This path involves proposals such as linking the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to other instruments, particularly cohesion policy, to promote economic and social cohesion within those coastal communities most dependent on fishing; support for economic activities associated with fishing, both upstream and downstream of it; and the diversification and not the substitution of fishing activities, with the development of complementary activities. Projects with integrated solutions that benefit all coastal communities as widely as possible should be preferred over those that benefit only a limited number of operators. Access to these projects should be guaranteed to fishermen and families and not only to ship-owners.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Other proposals include measures to rejuvenate the sector and encourage more young people to take up the occupation, by providing support to meet their professional training and start-up needs, among other things; the promotion of land-based activities; the recognition and promotion of the role of women in fishing; and the creation of an EU programme to support small-scale fishing that, by using several tools, particularly at a financial level, will respond to the specific problems of this segment and support sustainable, local management of the fisheries involved.</p>
      <p sl="pt">These are just some of the many proposals in our resolution that we believe the current reform should take on board, for the sake of the recognition of the multi-functional nature of the fisheries sector and the production of public goods.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me first take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Mato Adrover on his election as Chair of the committee. Unfortunately my colleague, the Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Ms Mette Gjerskov, was not able to be here today. However it is a pleasure for me to take part in this important debate on fisheries. I would like to address the different issues raised one by one.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the horse mackerel multi-annual plan, the Council shares the view expressed previously by Ms Fraga and today by Mr Gallagher on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries that the establishment of long-term management plans is key to conservation. That is why the Council has adopted 10 such plans since 2003 covering many, if not most, of the major stocks in the Union waters.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to inform you that the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the Council made considerable progress last November on a way forward on the proposed multiannual plan for the stock of western horse mackerel. I understand that Ms Fraga, Mr Gallagher and the shadow rapporteurs were informed of the outcome in early December. Against this background the Council will now be in a position to examine in full Parliament’s positions in first reading, and to that end work is beginning this week. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Honourable Members for their positive and pragmatic approach and I hope that results can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="en">I turn now to the proposed plan for the anchovy stock in the Bay of Biscay, which was also raised by the Honourable Members. The Council position is that this plan is not in line with the Treaty. The Council, at the level of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, therefore asked the Commission in the autumn of 2010 to withdraw the proposal. The Council has not discussed the plan since then.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council agrees that long-term management plans are one of the key elements of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. That is why it has made such an effort to unblock the situation for the plan for western horse mackerel. The Council is fully committed to cooperating with Parliament and the Commission to agree on a way forward. We are ready to work with you on this plan and on other long-term and management plans which are at the centre of conservation and of the reform of the common fishery policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I now turn to the issue of total allowable catch and quota regulation and begin by thanking Mr Mato Adrover for his question on the adoption of the 2012 fishing opportunities. I would like to start by restating that the Council continues its commitment to adopt measures that are fully in line with the relevant legal provisions. I strongly believe that this commitment is also reflected in the adoption of fishing opportunities for 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission presented two proposals for adoption of measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities for 2012, one on the internal aspect and the other on the external aspect. The Commission based its proposal on Article 43(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, under which the Council shall adopt measures on a proposal from the Commission on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council consistently agreed with the Commission’s choice of legal basis for the following reasons. The Council considers that Article 43(3) represents a self-standing specific legal basis that applies to clearly identified measures to be adopted under the Common Fisheries Policy. Furthermore, Article 43(3) of the Treaty speaks of measures which indicate that the authors of the Treaty intended to give the Council powers to adopt all measures that are inextricably linked to the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities. They can only cover measures which have a direct bearing on the quantitative fishing entitlements.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that, since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the objectives for the common fisheries policies, including those concerning multiannual plans, must be adopted in the ordinary legislative procedure with agreement between Parliament and the Council. The Council is committed to respecting that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you for your attention. I look forward to a very good debate here in Parliament today.</p>

    <intervention id="2-015-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to welcome the presence of the Council here: it is very important for everybody, Minister, to have you in this debate. So, honourable Members, I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss with you some very important issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The two first issues concern the new framework we have under the Lisbon Treaty, and I would like to repeat that the Commission is here to cooperate with everybody during this transitional period in order to find practical solutions. I reiterate that it is not the Commission’s aim, Mr Mato Adrover, to go against this House. We are trying to cooperate with everybody, and I think that citizens watching us in the context of the crisis would like to see all the EU institutions cooperating in the best way we can.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the horse mackerel plan and the long-term management plans in general, I agree with you, Mr Gallagher, and with Ms Rodust and the Presidency of course, that this is an issue of great importance in relation to the sustainability of stocks: it really is a matter of urgency. I agree with you also, Mr Gallagher, because, since this plan was proposed in 2009, we have based all quota proposals on the plan, and today this stock is actually fished fairly sustainably. This, therefore, is the way to go, and we have to be sure that we can secure this approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem in relation to these long-term management plans is – to cut a long story short – between Parliament and the Council. We need to agree on the respective competences of the two institutions, and this is something we have to do in cooperation, as best we can. So, the Council, Minister, has to do whatever it can to take the right decisions in order to find a solution here, and we need to compromise. We will facilitate this in any way we can.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would call on you, Minister, to take the decision in the Council as quickly as possible to go for a second reading. The only way to reach a compromise here is to go for the second reading in Parliament and the Commission. I promise here that we will do everything we can to facilitate the procedure but we need an urgent decision from you, the Council, in order to proceed.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the application of Article 43 of the Treaty, I agree with everybody that the procedure for fishing opportunities is an exception to the ordinary legislative procedure and therefore that it should be interpreted very strictly, and this is exactly what we are doing.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to remind you that, since 2010, the Commission has consistently limited its proposals to fishing opportunities and conditions functionally linked to them. Let me be clear here: fishing opportunities are quantified fishing rights. The Treaty refers to ‘fishing opportunities’. As a matter of principle, a quantified fishing right cannot exist in a void, so – while the Treaty does not refer to TACs and quotas – a TAC area or an allowed fishing season, for example, is necessary for fishing opportunities to work. Let all of us be reasonable here. We are talking about fishing opportunities and we have to respect the Treaties, so these conditions are functionally linked to fishing opportunities as they have a direct bearing on them.</p>
      <p sl="en">This, then, is our position: we have to cooperate here and we have to find the best way that all three institutions can live together. I do not think we face a power game here, and it is not a matter of the Commission trying to prevent Parliament from exercising its new powers.</p>
      <p sl="en">In relation to the last item raised by other Members of the House – Mr Ferreira, Mr Gróbarczyk and Ms Patrão Neves – namely, the contribution of the common fisheries policy to the production of public goods, I would like to highlight the specific measures provided for under the reform to improve the situation of the fisheries sector and, in particular, of small-scale fisheries and coastal communities. While I do not have time to discuss the whole idea of the common fisheries policy, I would like to focus on this issue of social sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Healthy stocks support larger catches of bigger fish. We have to realise that the only way to have a healthy fisheries sector is to have healthy stocks. There is no other way. We cannot invent any other way. We can give a lot of subsidies, a lot of money – taxpayers’ money – but if we do not have healthy stocks, then there is no way to have a healthy sector. This is something we all need to understand because healthy stocks can improve profitability and the wages and employment of fishermen, and also of people working in processing; and that is the best way of encouraging young people – whom Mr Gróbarczyk mentioned specifically – to come into the sector. If young people see that there is an income to be earned there, then they will come.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we can do more: I am not shirking my responsibilities, or the Commission’s responsibilities, and I am trying to do more in the framework of my reform proposals. Our funding has an important role to play here. I would underline the fact that we are paying special attention to small-scale fisheries. Why? Because the small-scale sector represents close to 80% of our fishing vessels and around 40% of onboard employment. We are taking special care here, as you can see in our proposal on small-scale vessels. We have recognised the importance of this sector and have made an effort to propose dedicated measures for these fleets.</p>
      <p sl="en">What are these measures? Business and innovation advisory services and higher aid intensity – and I would ask you not to overlook the latter, which includes a wide range of measures aimed at increasing income by supporting selectivity, marketing, product quality and innovation. We also want to support producer organisations and improvements in working conditions, safety, hygiene and training. We have special measures for all of this in our funding. I also made sure that the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) has increased funding for the sustainable development of coastal areas. In our impact assessment we came to the conclusion that the EMFF could result in around 12 500 additional full-time jobs in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Honourable Members, you rightly call for attractive jobs. I can understand the situation. I really can understand the situation of fishermen and their families and of coastal communities in the middle of the economic crisis, so I am determined to deliver on your demand, and I am convinced that together we can get it right. Your proposals are very welcome and I will try to my best to adopt all possible measures to give our small-scale fisheries and our coastal communities a future.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, my remarks are intended directly for the Commissioner and the Minister. Commissioner, a year and a half ago, I urged you to act courageously as, in doing so, you would have had the support of Parliament. Now it seems to me that, instead, the idea prevails that Parliament is a sort of deadweight, a frill, in the procedures and that the Commission often prefers to take a stance that differs little if at all from the Council’s, which avoids having a genuine relationship with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">Today, we are debating the reform of the common fisheries policy. Parliament is asking questions, while ministers are already mediating the Commission’s proposal. This goes beyond the application of Article 43(3). We must really reinstate the principle that the Treaty of Lisbon conferred on Parliament, and I believe that on this point, we must take a cultural leap in our relationships, rather than work in fine detail, trying to grasp whether we are on the right track by following this or that procedure. This is a different problem. I believe that we are still not aware of the role that Parliament can play when it comes to the fisheries sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, we shall vote on the report that has been presented to us in a distinguished manner this morning by Ms Patrão Neves. If Parliament supports it, this resolution will immediately draw very important lines in the sand for the coming reform.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am not absolutely persuaded by the proposals regarding the socioeconomic aspect of the proposed reform. They effectively amount to driving the workforce out of the sector, not about finding alternative employment. I believe that here too we must take a culturally different direction. The list of issues you have drawn up is really short, as it does not set out a scenario for substituting fishing by some other occupation, where, say, aquaculture or tourism could have a key role.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that these measures have simply been relegated to a question of transferable rights, which, Commissioner, give absolutely no guarantee of a socioeconomic application for the reduction in fishing, because …</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I am sorry that some Members have still not understood the concept that if there were no fish there would be no jobs for fishermen. This debate is important because it sets a precedent for the future, for the setting of long-term management plans – which has been recognised as crucial to the whole reform of the common fisheries policy – and showing that we have sustainable fish for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Minister has referred to Article 43(3) of the Treaty, which says that the Council should adopt measures on fixing quantitative limitations and the allocation of fishing opportunities, but Article 43(2) says that the European Parliament, in partnership with the Council, shall establish the provisions necessary for the pursuit of the obligations of the common fisheries policy. Clearly there is a dispute and a lack of clarity here. Whatever other disputes there may be amongst Members of this Parliament, I suspect we will mostly be united on standing up for the position of Parliament as we see it in the Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is not as though the Council has a very good record to defend. We know that its application of Article 43(3) has been abysmal, involving annual meetings which are notorious even amongst former fisheries ministers. These are gladiatorial contests where ministers come to stand up for national interests, over-fishing and setting limits. According to the University of York’s latest estimates, over the past few years these have exceeded best scientific advice by 33%, with the result that we have seen too much over-fishing and a decline in fish stocks across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Looking to the future, we all recognise that long-term management plans are key. I think it is important that we also recognise the urgency of this. If we are to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2015, we have got to get the reformed fishing regulation through as quickly as possible, and the Commission is going to have to come forward with long-term management plans in rapid succession, which must clear the parliamentary process in rapid succession. We have to keep delays to a minimum, so this matter must be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the fact that the Danish Presidency has this high on its agenda and I thoroughly support the Commissioner in what she is saying, which is: let us go for a second reading, let us have our debate, let us make absolutely clear what are the lines of difference between the Council and the Commission, and then let us negotiate. This will be resolved by negotiation between the two institutions. The sooner we do that, the sooner we can put in place the measures necessary to ensure that we have healthy fish stocks for the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, everyone agrees, it seems, that in the future common fisheries policy long-term management plans should be the basis of management. This failure to come up with a solution for anchovy and for horse mackerel – for two years now the institutions have not really come up with a solution – could be interpreted by citizens as proof that the EU institutions are not mature enough or efficient enough to deal with even such relatively simple questions. These issues need to be resolved for the EU to be credible in its reform of fisheries policies. We need to put this dispute on competences into perspective in relation to the real issue here, which is that we have the responsibility to defend and optimise what is really a public good – fish and the marine environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">This leads me to the second topic of this debate, the contribution the CFP makes to the common good. Let us be honest here. Technology advances all the time and fishermen become more and more efficient at fishing, which means we need fewer fishermen today to catch the same amount of fish as were caught yesterday. Employment in the catching sector in Europe today accounts for less than 0.1% of the total EU labour force and half of these licensed fishermen are only fishing part-time. Any increased employment in the sector must involve things other than being more efficient at fishing. This could be ‘pesca-tourism’, it could mean adding value to catches in different ways, but one thing is for sure, if increased employment is what we want then we cannot promote more efficient fishing methods, including giving funds to fuel-efficient engines.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to point out that it is a proven fact that over-fishing promotes algal blooms in Europe, causing lots of problems for different sectors. Fish in aquaculture pens die because of it, fishing gear gets clogged by it, and tourists seek other destinations when they cannot swim because of the green pea soup. A low estimate puts costs in Europe caused by algal bloom at EUR 177 million per year. When we speak about fish as a common good it is very important to keep in mind the different functions of wild fish in our oceans. One is to provide food, but another much more important one is that fish are crucial agents in the marine ecosystems. When we deplete stocks, water quality suffers and thereby many other economic sectors in Europe, such as tourism, do so too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the report released by the Court of Auditors last week laid bare the failings of the common fisheries policy. EUR 1.7 billion has been wasted since 2002 in vessel decommissioning, which has failed to demonstrate any tangible result as the CFP cannot specify where overcapacity exists. Instead, 90% of stocks are now overfished – 30% beyond safe biological levels. On top of that, 100 000 jobs have been lost.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Prince of Wales’ think-tank, the International Sustainability Unit, specifies that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem. Management of stocks must be dynamic and localised. Devolving control of waters to local level would create an incentive for fishermen to maintain resources in the long term, as they would directly profit from the proliferation of their own stock. The British fleet is permitted to catch only one-fifth of the fish in UK waters. The sense of husbandry was lost when EU waters were carved up to serve a range of foreign vessels. Short-term profit is the only focus for a boat that has travelled far from its own coastline to fish.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report also highlights the importance of managing the marine ecosystem as a whole, rather than targeting individual species, which can have a knock-on effect on other stocks. Only through locally managed real-time area closures can we rebuild an ecologically sound, profitable fishing industry. Through restoring the UK share of fish stocks alone, the industry could also employ 46% more people and make an extra GBP 400 million – equivalent to 24 times the UK annual subsidy. Subsidies artificially reduce the cost of fishing, allowing it to continue beyond the point of profitability.</p>
      <p sl="en">Norway and Iceland are leading examples of successful redirection of subsidies and management of stocks. They, of course, are not in the EU. In Iceland, spawning rates have doubled. I am sure that if everyone appealed to common sense and examined the Commission’s track record they would agree that the best way of protecting the ocean for future generations and safeguarding national fishing industries is to take control out of the hands of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, over the past two years the Pelagic Regional Advisory Council and others have exuded a great deal of energy in the development of a multiannual plan for the western stock of horse mackerel. They are understandably upset that their efforts are being frustrated by a failure to implement the plan, a situation which is being blamed by some on the ongoing game of ping-pong between the EU’s institutions, namely this Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">The development of long-term management plans is the way forward for Europe’s commercial fisheries. The absence of such a plan was one of the reasons given for the imposition of a 10 % cut in Irish Sea herring for 2012, although I must say that this was also a moveable argument over the course of these negotiations in the weeks and months before it. However, this plan is now being fast-tracked.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, for once I agree with Mr Davies: no fish means no fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The situation regarding the multi-annual plan for the western stock of Atlantic horse mackerel is of concern to us today for several reasons. This management plan was adopted by Parliament in November 2010 in order to ensure that stocks would be managed sustainably. Since then, Parliament is still awaiting the Council’s first reading. It is therefore crucial for the Council to take a stand on this plan.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As long as the situation remains at a standstill, nothing will be done about Atlantic horse mackerel stocks and the resource will be under threat. This deadlock is due to an institutional conflict which must be resolved as quickly as possible. Like my fellow Members, I believe that the management plan comes under the ordinary legislative procedure. Parliament showed that it was open to discussion by introducing flexibility with regard to the method of calculating fishing opportunities. The Council must now explain why it has not taken a stand on this matter at first reading. This deadlock is also delaying progress on related issues such as that of the anchovy, as well as all future multi-annual plans for adoption.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We also call for the Commission to facilitate dialogue between Parliament and the Council. On the eve of the common fisheries policy (CFP) reform, under which management plans must be applied across the board, we must haul ourselves out of this institutional deadlock which is detrimental to the conservation of resources.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, with regard to Ms Patrão Neves’s initiative, I naturally share his concern that the fishing sector be considered as contributing to the production of public goods and that the principle of conditionality be applied.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, fishing does not happen in a void. It happens within our seas and is based on fish stock availability. Thus, having more fish is about fishermen’s income and about securing jobs. That is why the show that we put on for the Council, each time we have to make and put forward our decisions on TAC quotas and multiannual plans, is really misplaced. In the midst of this European debt crisis we always take the decision to fish, to consume more now and create debt for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the reform of the common fisheries policy Parliament will be asking for fisheries reserves, so as to add this discussion an element seeking to reassure people that there will be fish available and that there will be more fish in our seas, more easily fished by our fishermen, both for our fishermen and our coastal communities, and for our common future. I have just seen a description of what Parliament will be asking for, namely that fishery reserves are areas where we do not fish, where we leave the stocks to be revitalised and come back to their original numbers. And around them we can catch more fish much faster and more easily.</p>

      <p sl="en">My constituents in the fishing nation of Scotland will not be impressed if CFP reform does not sweep away the failed practices which have so discredited the European Union’s role in fisheries management.

      <p sl="da">A great deal has changed in the fisheries sector over the last 20 years. There are now far fewer active fishermen, but the fishing industry helps to create new jobs in other sectors. There are good opportunities in the small fishing communities for tourism and teaching as well as the supply of speciality products to local restaurants. The fishing industry contributes both to the cultural heritage of the local area and to general development in coastal areas. Fisheries must coexist with biodiversity and the marine environment. Aquaculture needs to be developed, for example by cultivating shellfish and algae for bioethanol, cosmetics and medicines. We must also fish out any waste and take care of the coastal marine environment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the best conservation measure would be for the UK to withdraw from the EU and regain exclusive control of our fishing grounds. Overfishing is the direct result of access to our waters by other Member States. Our default position is opposition to any common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it would be churlish not to recognise the improvements that some of the proposals would bring. The end to the discard policy is welcome but long overdue. The return of unwanted fish that are likely to survive, the counting of other unintentionally caught adult fish towards quotas, and the selling of accidentally caught undersize fish for pet food and fishmeal are all reasonable proposals within the context of the common fisheries policy. But why has it taken so long for the EU to address the obscene discard policy? We are told that the policy will end in 2016. Will it really? And why has it been so long in coming?</p>
      <p sl="en">For as long as we remain in the EU, the total allowable catch figures and the number of days at sea allocated to the UK must reflect the fact that we provide a massively disproportionate amount of the total fishing grounds and the stock of fish.</p>
      <p sl="en">When it comes to Community aid to the fishery sector, our fishermen, such as those in Whitby, Hull and Grimsby, do not receive fair treatment. Our fishing sector gets only 3% of the aid, whereas Spain gets 26%, and Poland 17%. Our tonnage is just under half that of Spain, and our total catch is about three quarters. Even Romania, whose main catch is goldfish, gets more aid than the UK.</p>

Is the Commissioner ready to recognise that there is more to the common fisheries policy (CFP) than just catching fish, but that the CFP can add to the socio-economic life of coastal communities in terms of local development and creating jobs – directly and indirectly – in the sector?</p>
      <p sl="ga">For example, the majority of the fishing industry in Ireland is situated around the coast in remote communities which usually have no other industry, in places, for example, in which Irish is the community’s first language and in which aspects of the native culture are intertwined, for example music, dance, literature and other cultural pursuits. That is the socio-economic aspect I am emphasising.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Finally, I would like to say in my strongest words – and I speak here on behalf of the Irish MEPs – that we cannot accept the TACs (Total Allowable Catches).

As a Parliamentary representative of the Netherlands, I think back to what happened following the throwing out, at such a late stage, of the agreement with Morocco.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, fishing is about more than just supplying high-quality protein: it is a way of life. Therefore, the reform of the common fisheries policy is an indicator of the European Union’s commitment to sustainability. It should be a reform with a holistic dimension encompassing economic, social, regional and environmental aspects.</p>
      <p sl="es">Two out of every 1000 jobs in the European Union are in the fisheries sector. In communities such as Galicia, this percentage is 15 times higher. It is therefore imperative to provide better jobs and an efficient, high-quality sector. It is also necessary for the sector to play a part in developing sustainable fishing and promoting development of the local area and fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="es">In terms of the environment, we need to preserve resources, ecosystems and biodiversity. We need to encourage good environmental practices, singling out not only small-scale fishing but also aquaculture, with extensive and traditional activities, and all this needs to be done within the framework of an integrated maritime policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">There are many aspects – and the most important thing is to recognise that fishing is a multi-sectoral and multi-functional activity – and all of these need to be taken into account when reforming fisheries policy so that it can add value to the sector within the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate about the sustainable management of the Atlantic horse mackerel is, of course, also a welcome opportunity to discuss what shape the common fisheries policy should take for the next 10 or 20 years. As we do so, we need to observe that what has been the practice up to now – fleshed out by appropriate implementing regulations from the Commission and its officials – did not prove its worth in all areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">That does not mean, however, that we should throw those instruments that are tried and tested overboard. I am thinking, in that context, of relative stability, so that there is clarity about how quotas are distributed, so that we do not have an appreciation of value of quotas and total allowable catches (TACs) that are then left in the bank but instead see an exchange of quotas in individual sea areas. What we havehere is, in fact, a key question which relates to how we deal with our resources in the seas as a whole when it comes to discards, or fish that are thrown back. We need to find a solution for this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same also applies when we discuss how resources are frittered away. If we look at our stocks of birds of prey or seals, these are reserves that we in Europe cannot frivolously give away when we are an enormous market of 500 million inhabitants, who consume 8 million tonnes of fish and fishery products.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are an enormous import market and for that reason we really must provide a future for coastal fishing and small-scale fishing in particular. Thus, we must include a means within our common fisheries policy of financially supporting young fishermen starting up new businesses, , who ultimately wish to take on a licence or a boat. We are already doing thisfor young farmers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Similarly, we must not always discuss this matter in such dogmatic terms and simply repeat a refrain of ‘For goodness’ sake, no investment in the fleet!’ No, that is wrong. Some of the boats in our fleet are 60 years old and powered by outmoded diesel engines. These are the worst polluters of the environment, and we are not spending a single penny on renewing the fleet. I believe that this is an issue that we absolutely need to discuss.</p>
      <p sl="de">In modern fishing, quotas must obviously be in proportion to engine power, and of course we need reasonable monitoring of fishing. However, if we publish multi-annual plans – for example for cod in the Baltic – and the Commission and its officials then come out and say that there need to be additional controls to ensure that even small, open boats, without a wheel house, keep a logbook …</p>

The sooner it happens, the better for the quantity of fish in the sea and for the fishermen’s way of life. Also, I commend my Irish colleague Pat the Cope Gallagher for the great work he always does on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="ga">I have a few brief points to make. I agree completely with the points made regarding the need for regionalisation, the preservation of coastal areas, the gillnets to which Mr Gallagher referred, the danger of transferable fishing concessions (TFCs) and the absolute desirability of eliminating discards. If we can address all that …</p>
      <p sl="ga">we will have made great progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is more to the fisheries sector than catching and processing fish: it brings numerous social, economic and cultural benefits to communities in Europe. The fishing sector now includes both the coastal tourism sector and aquaculture. The opening up of our coastal towns to fishing tourism generates direct and indirect employment opportunities worth promoting. Many fishing towns can be quite isolated, and by targeting coastal tourism and aquaculture, the Common Fisheries Policy can make such communities sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="en">You can board a charter vessel to experience the thrill of sea fishing – in my constituency you can do this in Cork harbour for example – and various other tours allow people to hire small boats and go out to sea themselves to fish. Other tours bring people to fish off the wrecks of sunken ships. Small fishing communities cannot be assessed purely in economic or catch value terms. They often have a rich cultural heritage and vibrant gastronomic, economic and literary identities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, when the Council formulates European policy it needs to do so in an open, transparent and participatory way.</p>
      <p sl="es">Those were the principles we applied in the anchovy plan which was adopted by Parliament. However, the Council has chosen to follow an antiquated policy, maintaining the status quo, in an obscurantist way, without acknowledging the role of Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty and taking decisions on criteria which are not always in tune with the interests of the fisheries sector or of society as a whole. Meanwhile, the Commission says nothing.</p>
      <p sl="es">They have to change the way they operate. If they do not, they will continue to enmesh themselves further in the political crisis they have created by their own actions. In the 21st century one leads, one does not command, yet you veto. You negotiate amongst yourselves, but authority and legitimacy should be obtained by consent.</p>
      <p sl="es">Stop blocking this and other plans. Recognise the role of Parliament, because the challenge is to build the future of the fisheries sector together.</p>

We are very worried about the social and economic aspects of the reform of the fisheries policy, especially the implications for small-scale fisheries.</p>
      <p sl="en">How can the Commission realise concrete measures to help small-scale fisheries, and especially the women and men working in fisheries communities? Small-scale fisheries are an example of social, territorial and economic cohesion and are also more ecological, but the sector is very concerned about the conservation of fish on account of the pollution of waters.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, we are facing a deep economic crisis that affects the fisheries sector. The Commission has been telling us that fishing is now sufficiently sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="es">Well then, Ms Damanaki, we need fair fishing quotas, especially for species like mackerel and anchovy. We need to look at the allocation of quotas more carefully so that it does not have a detrimental effect on many European regions, including my region, Cantabria.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this we need all these multi-annual plans. There are thousands of fishermen waiting for these institutional squabbles to be resolved.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I share all the concerns of Members of Parliament with reference to the fisheries sector, coastal communities and the need to be sure about growth and jobs. I was in Vigo, Galicia yesterday and I saw there what is happening, so I can understand everything you are saying.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can we really do? I agree with those Members of this House who stressed that, in order to achieve social sustainability, we need healthy stocks. I would like to remind some Members of this House of what has been happening up until now. In the past decade 30 % of jobs in the catching sector have been lost. So asking me to keep the status quo is not an option. We are going to lose more jobs. We have to change things. We have a proposal. You may disagree, but at least this is a proposal to move forward. We have to have discussions and find ways to sustain the stocks because, for example, if we reach maximum sustainable yield by 2015, many jobs will be added to the sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to emphasise that our proposal agrees with what we have already said, namely that fisheries is not only about stocks. It is a multi-sector and we need a multi-sectoral approach. We have ancillary sectors, as many of you stressed – processing, cooking, aquaculture, we have maritime tourism, we have a lot of issues in connection with this – so we have to try to find a balance between all these activities. This is what we are trying to do through our proposal. I hope that we will have the time to discuss it in this House in the proper way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many Members referred to the issue of regionalisation. I agree with you that this is of great importance. For example, Mr Gallagher referred to gillnets and the haddock stock. This is an issue we have to handle under codecision for the moment. We need regionalisation because, if we are going to approve the Commission’s proposal – and I know that you are not happy and not satisfied with this proposal, but let me give you this example – if this proposal, our proposal, for reform were in place then the Member States concerned could have these decisions as quickly as possible and the problem of gillnets would be solved. Now we have to go through co-decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are also other issues, such as technical measures – there were a lot of references to these – which we can solve through the proposal as it stands. Of course, if we can improve it we will be happy to have your ideas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding other points, many references were made to the need for investment in the sector. I agree with you. We have to invest but we have to invest in gear selectivity and in real modernisation of the fleet, not in increasing over-capacity. This will not give us solutions. I would agree with Mr Bufton, who emphasised the importance of the Court of Auditors’ report. Yes, this is a European institution, the Court of Auditors, and I am very happy that you are highlighting the importance of this report. We will respect this report. That is why our proposal referring to subsidies in the sector in the future is aligned to this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the issue of Morocco, which was mentioned, we have taken a decision on Morocco referring to the previous protocol which was stopped by a decision of this House. This is not a Spanish decision but a European decision, so it refers to everybody who has something to do with the clear ideas of this decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last point concerns institutional issues. I have a plea to make to the Presidency. We expect the Danish Presidency to move ahead on this subject. Parliament and the Commission are both expecting the Danish Presidency to move on. It is not enough to refer to the previous achievements of the previous presidencies. The previous presidencies of the Council did not move on this, as almost all the Members of this House pointed out. We need a step forward. At the very least we need an urgent decision in order to go for a second reading and a compromise.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, thank you very much for this important debate. I would like to begin by thanking Mr Gallagher, Ms Lövin, Mr Davies, Mr Stevenson, Ms Dodds and others for the call to find a solution to this important, but also very difficult, issue concerning the multi-annual plan for the western stock of horse mackerel. The Council has spent a long time determining its position on this matter. However, as I have already said, the Council has made progress in this regard recently, and I expect it to have established its position very soon. The Council’s working group is starting work in this regard this week. The next step is the approval of a negotiating mandate in the Permanent Representatives Committee. After that, the Council will be ready to work with the European Parliament to find a solution to the horse mackerel issue. We will hopefully succeed in finding a solution that is acceptable to the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="da">We all agree that multi-annual management plans must continue to be a fundamental instrument in fisheries management, ensuring a focus on the important long-term conservation objectives for fish stocks. The Council will therefore work with the European Parliament on a solution for the horse mackerel plan as well as for other multi-annual plans. I am therefore in complete agreement with Mr Davies, Mr Cadec and others on the need to ensure sustainable fish stocks. As Mr Davies put it, if there is no fish, there will be no fisheries either.</p>
      <p sl="da">The Council is fully aware of the European Parliament’s role in connection with the adoption of the objectives in the common fisheries policy, including the objectives for multi-annual management plans and technical conservation measures. These objectives must be adopted jointly by the Council and the European Parliament, and the Council attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with the European Parliament in this connection.</p>
      <p sl="da">With regard to the question concerning the setting of total allowable catch (TAC) and quotas, I would like to emphasise the Council’s strong obligation only to adopt measures that are fully in line with the relevant provisions of the Treaty, whilst fully respecting the role of each institution. It goes without saying that the Council will ensure that the reformed common fisheries policy is in line with the Treaty and that it respects the European Parliament’s prerogatives. This will, of course, also be the case irrespective of what form of procedure we have in the future. It will also apply in the event of a regionalised approach, something which is currently being considered in the context of the reform. On behalf of the Council, I therefore look forward to close cooperation with the Commission and Parliament in finding solutions to the important questions that we have debated today.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, my question is addressed to Mr Barnier in particular and concerns recital 62 of the Services Directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is no clear or definitive indication of what is meant by ‘scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity’. The Directive ought not, in fact, to prevent Member States from limiting the number of authorisations for reasons other than scarcity of natural resources or technical capacity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Indeed, as in the case of itinerant traders, they do not have exclusive use of the area subject to concession because at the end of working hours, this becomes available to all, and is sometimes reassigned to other activities. Moreover, in Italy, local authorities may already increase the number both of concessions and areas reserved for markets.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this case, therefore, there ought not to be an automatic correlation between the concept of public space and the criterion of scarce natural resources, since parking may take place in one part of the area only and for a limited number of hours per day.</p>
      <p sl="it">What is your opinion on this matter, Commissioner?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Angelilli asked a question on the exclusion of social services and how this should be interpreted.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some social services have been excluded from the directive, but not all. Moreover, I should like to remind you that an amendment on the exclusion of all such services was rejected by Parliament. I do not believe that my services have informed me of any issues regarding the application of the directive to social services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The specific nature of some services, such as those which you mentioned, is recognised and taken into account by safeguards set out in the directive. The directive does not address the issue of the funding of these services. The conditions set by Member States to ensure that these services indeed fulfil their social function are not covered by its scope.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thus, Ms Angelilli, the directive does not prevent Member States from conserving their authorisation systems which are substantiated by social policy objectives, for example for the opening of crèches. These objectives may relate to the protection of minors or vulnerable people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think it is fair to say that it is logical that the directive’s implementation should not create problems for social services, such as those, if I understood correctly, that you highlighted.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor. As you know, my group has for quite some time been calling for the Posting of Workers Directive to be revised, and I find it very regrettable that the Commission has thus far not done so. It is not as if there is a shortage of reasons to do so: we have social dumping on a massive scale and the principle of equal treatment applies to too few criteria. Furthermore, there is often abuse of posted workers by means of failure to adhere to the rules. What we need is limits on subcontractor chains and more opportunities for information for workers. I therefore await the Commission’s proposals on the posting of workers package with baited breath.</p>
      <p sl="de">My question is this: how does the Commission proposal for the Enforcement Directive seek to tackle the problems with the Posting of Workers Directive that I have outlined? Most importantly, are there measures in the proposal to prevent the well-known problem of social dumping?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-053-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the Posting of Workers Directive is indeed very high on our agenda and we have work in progress despite the fact that originally the idea was to deliver this at the end of last year. I have to admit there is a little delay with this package, but this is also about quality and we believe that it is very important to get it right after such a long period of conflict and consultation. We invested a lot in this consultation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last June, at a conference we organised in Brussels, I outlined the structure of the legal instruments the Commission would like to use to address the question of posting. This consists of two elements: an enforcement directive in order to ensure that the implementation of the original directive improves in terms of its quality, and a Monti II regulation on social rights, following the pattern of the previous Monti I Regulation in the context of cross-border trade, only this time in the context of cross-border services.</p>
      <p sl="en">The objective of the latter is to ensure that fundamental social rights are not subordinated to economic freedoms and vice-versa, and that there are further clarifications about the powers of various courts if industrial action takes place. But I think it is very important to stress that by reopening the original directive we would not go very far; in fact we would undermine the key objective of the original legal instrument which is to facilitate cross-border services and at the same time fight social dumping.</p>
      <p sl="en">The enforcement directive will facilitate further cross-border service provision for companies through better administrative cooperation, more transparent information and limits to national control measures. It will prevent abuses by clarifying the elements of the notion of posting, limit the opportunities to impose national control measures by codifying the case law of the Court, and contribute to fairer competition and a more level playing field, for example, for SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The key is better administrative cooperation. We have had many consultations with stakeholders and the various participants in this debate with a view to taking every possible aspect into account. There is still fine tuning to do, and the proposed date for adoption is March.</p>

It passed the new agreement negotiated with the Troika in Greece, knowing that it imposes harsh austerity measures and new savage cuts on a nation already suffering deeply.</p>
      <p sl="el">In view of that agreement, the question is: what do Brussels, Berlin and Paris intend to do about the issue we are debating today? I am not talking about current and future loans; that money will be refunded with interest. I am talking about the famous Marshall Plan which was included in the agreement at the summit on 21 July and then disappeared a few hours later.</p>
      <p sl="el">Now more than ever, Greece and other countries with problems need a package to stimulate the economy, with resources directed to public works, job creation and the re-education and training of the unemployed.

      <p sl="fr">Mr Papanikolaou, each of my colleagues can answer this question, which expresses the sentiment of the Greek people faced with the great difficulties which they are experiencing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I have said many times, including a few months ago, on my visit to Athens, is that the Greek people are not alone. Through exceptional measures, the entire EU and the International Monetary Fund have provided support to Greece in this comprehensive plan towards its recovery, and I am not just referring to public finances.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are aware, Mr Papanikolaou, that the effort which is being asked of Greek people is extremely stringent and demanding. However, I believe that the fundamental Greek economic indicators show that, if this plan is followed and respected by all of the partners and by the Greeks themselves, the Greek people can come through this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since what we are discussing here today, Mr Papanikolaou, is the Services Directive and the service economy, I should like to underline that beyond the activities covered by the directive itself, which make up 40% of the EU’s economy, services, as we are well aware, account for an even greater part of GDP, in the EU’s economy. This is particularly the case in your country, which is one of the most open and best positioned in this respect, especially as regards the tourist industry economy, which is an area that Commissioner Tajani is monitoring relentlessly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe, as I also said in another debate yesterday, that Greece, despite the great difficulties it is facing, can bounce back, particularly by being one of the countries to integrate itself the most and the most quickly. This integration is needed – and a number of sectors are concerned, including many services, especially connected to the tourism economy – because Greece is one of the countries which has the most to benefit from an integrated single market and the facilitation of trade, electronic commerce, mobility and exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, along with my colleagues, I am going to take great care, as is my role as the person in charge of this Directive on Services, to support the Greek authorities in implementing all aspects and the full potential of this Directive on Services, on a practical level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is what I am able to say since the matter we are discussing today is the service economy.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for what you have told us; however, you have not replied to the specific question which I asked: on 21 July – I repeat – the Council spoke of real help at its meeting, of a true sign of social solidarity. It referred to a new Marshall Plan which could support growth and job creation in real and substantial solidarity with countries with serious problems.</p>
      <p sl="el">The text ‘went in’, but some hours later it ‘went out again’. Does the Commission have something else in mind? We have seen the announcements by Mr Barroso about the problems faced by citizens. We understand the Commission’s concern. However, are there in fact any new developments in the final proposal actually made by the Commission?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Papanikolaou, what you said in regard to Greece, which is the most exceptional and serious of cases and which, moreover, requires exceptional treatment, applies across the board.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, personally, deeply feel that it is not right, for EU citizens at the moment, for us to only be talking about austerity, regulation, surveillance and governance. All of these words are restrictive, even if they are the words and actions which are needed. We must also talk about growth and give citizens a clearer outlook in terms of employment and development. This is true for Greece and it is also true for the whole of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I find it extremely positive that at the last European Council meeting, held about ten days ago, the majority of the agenda was devoted to growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What can be done in the short term to restart the economic machine in the countries where this is needed? What can be done in the medium or long term? For example, with the Single Market Act, of which the Services Directive is one of the components, we have a dozen or so measures on our agenda for facilitating mobility, employment, export, innovation and trade and to kick-start growth in the medium or long term. Other initiatives, such as the project bonds, may be taken as a shorter-term solution to achieving growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, as regards Greece, I think that under the plan which amounts to EUR 130 billion, it is not just a case of getting public finances back on track and safeguarding the banking sector, it is also a case of taking rapid action, in particular via Structural Funds, to get employment and growth going again.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is in this context, Mr Papanikolaou, that the service economy, which is so important for your country and which is one of the most open and most powerful in Europe in terms of tourism, has a special role to play. I will devote my full attention to this to ensure that this Services Directive is actually and effectively implemented in Greece’s case and for Greece’s benefit.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Would you mind telling me, please, how much progress the Commission has made with drafting legislation to provide operators in the social and solidarity-based economy with a status? I am referring to mutuals, foundations and cooperatives. These kinds of organisation indeed play a crucial role in cushioning crises and creating jobs and must therefore be protected, supported and encouraged to develop very quickly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, if something concrete is in fact being drafted for the social economy, can we really be content with a simple communication on a quality framework for services of general interest which, in these times of economic and social crisis, also need to be protected by a genuine legal status?</p>

    <intervention id="2-061-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank you, Ms Vergnaud, for having, in fact, mentioned two separate and complementary sections of the directive in your question. The first is that of public services and the implementation of this quality framework which Mr Almunia and I have on the whole proposed in two cross-cutting texts. One of these texts deals with State aid and, as you pointed out, and as the relevant associations and non-governmental organisations have made clear to us, the exercise of social services continues to be covered. The second cross-cutting text – which is a major aspect of this quality framework – deals with the overhaul of measures relating to public services and concessions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Social entrepreneurship which, according to my figures, honourable Members accounts for between 15% and 17% of GDP and employment, is an additional issue and is, in my mind, just as important as the main area of work on the social economy. In many cases, we are not talking about public services, but profitable enterprises which practice social inclusion among their employees, by employing disabled persons or other people in difficulty, or enterprises whose activities themselves have a vocation focused on solidarity, inclusion or social solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In fact, a few weeks ago, in November, for the first time, we in the Commission held a conference with Professor Yunus, which was attended by 1 200 people and which aimed to help us work on three topics. The first was the financing of such enterprises, and in this regard the Commission presented an initial proposal on the Social Investment Fund, which is a new instrument.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second was regulatory and normative or statutory supervision, which is the point you mentioned. A few days ago, Ms Vergnaud, as promised, we submitted the European Foundation Statute, which is now under discussion by the Council and by Parliament. Mr Tajani is working on statutes for cooperatives and mutuals which are extremely important forms of organisation, and for which it is important to establish what further improvements can be made at European level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third area of work on social entrepreneurship involves improving the visibility of these activities through indicators, labels, and so on, and I myself am pursuing this area. I am, in any case, personally engaged, alongside Mr Andor, Mr Tajani and others, in ensuring that from now on Commission initiatives support this extremely important sector, which has undoubtedly been neglected or forgotten and which certainly comes under the competitive economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is my belief, honourable Members, that there cannot be sustainable economic performance without a number of conditions: an effectively functioning single market, a major effort in research and innovation, and social cohesion. When we refer to social cohesion, we are referring, Ms Vergnaud, to the two topics that you mentioned: public services, of course, that is to say basic services, in particular social services, but also the social enterprise sector, which I have just mentioned and which we endorse.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I shall also respond to the question on cooperatives, which is a sector that I share with Mr Barnier.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As part of the effort to improve the legal environment, we have initiated a review aimed at analysing the current situation of mutuals in Europe. The findings will form the basis for reflection on a new political initiative, including the possible drafting of a European statute for mutuals. This work will complement the review which the European Parliament began at the beginning of 2011.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also going to publish a report addressed at European institutions on the application of the regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society. This report will be discussed at two conferences to be held this year, which the United Nations has declared as the International Year of Cooperatives. The first conference will be held in April, and attended by professional associations, and the second in September during Cyprus’ Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With respect to cooperatives, their social impact is, is my view, very significant. We are going to continue to support them together with cooperative banks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to cite an example: I organised a trip to Brazil on the topic of the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises and took representatives from cooperatives along with me to try to promote networks for the internationalisation of cooperatives. This is, for me, a very important sector and I share what was said by Commissioner Barnier.</p>

      <p sl="bg">My question is for Commissioner Tajani. Implementing the Services Directive was an important step towards the completion of the single market. Given that services represent about 70% of the European economy, their potential for boosting economic growth and creating new jobs is substantial. We have to admit, however, that Member States have had difficulties with the transposition of the Directive and that, despite the three-year implementation period, there have been considerable delays. Besides the transposition of European legislation into national legislations, a series of additional measures were necessary in order to implement the provisions of the Directive. Nonetheless, more than two years have elapsed now, which is a long enough period to allow the results to be measured. Is the Commission able to offer any concrete data, analyses and estimates on what impact the implementation of the Services Directive has had on the European economy so far, and more specifically, on small and medium-sized enterprises?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-065-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Ms Hyusmenova, I do not wish to deny Mr Tajani the opportunity to speak, however I am, in fact, directly in charge of the implementation of this directive, which is now a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to inform you and your colleagues, Ms Hyusmenova, that I make it my own personal duty to go to each Member State to see how things are going. A few days ago, on Thursday, I was in Madrid where I delivered the last of the 27 workshops which – as promised before Parliament – I have held in all of the EU’s capitals with all of the national civil servants who are, in particular, responsible for the Services Directive, but who are also responsible for the directives on professional qualifications and public procurement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I can tell you that, following this period of work with all of the civil servants who are responsible for these texts, all of the Member States, apart from Greece, have now taken full transposition measures. Germany and Austria, whose federal system you are familiar with, have had some rather specific issues, due in fact to this federal system, as the texts had to be transposed at regional level. This has recently been achieved.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the two complaints that I lodged before the European Court of Justice can now be withdrawn, since Germany and Austria have fulfilled their obligations. The court referral for Greece is still relevant as regards the quality of the transposition measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I promised, and this is something that you requested specifically in adopting the Services Directive, to present a report on the application of the directive’s key measures. In addition to what was already presented last Monday on the mutual assessment process involving Member States and undertaken by the Commission, we will present a report, in the second quarter of 2012, on the application of all of the directive’s key measures, especially on the important issue of cross-border services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are also drawing the first conclusions, in our role as guardian of the Treaties, on the weaknesses or shortcomings that exist with regard to the practical and effective implementation of the directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as I am concerned, honourable Members, 2012 should be the year of the full application of the Services Directive as it stands with all of its measures and all of its potential. Aside from what I have been able to say today on the matter and the work which I am doing in each Member State, this issue is the subject of the full and detailed assessment and information report which we will present to you by the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="en">In the context of the Services Directive, economic freedoms and the protection of workers’ rights, Commission President Barroso stated in this House on 15 September 2009: ‘The interpretation and the implementation of the Posted Workers Directive falls short … That is why I am committed to proposing, as soon as possible, a regulation to resolve the problems that have arisen. This regulation will be codecided by the European Parliament and the Council.’</p>
      <p sl="en">It is now 2012. The instrument in question was scheduled for publication before Christmas. It was then scheduled for last week and then it was deferred again, and now we do not know what is happening at all with this suggestion. My question is: when will the Commission finally deliver, after more than two years of framing its proposals on economic freedoms? And when, Commissioner, will you deliver on protecting workers’ rights and securing the right to strike?</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there is a rumour that the ‘Monti II’ regulation is not to be codecided, but is to be subject to consent procedure only. How does that correspond to the promise Mr Barroso gave in 2009?</p>

      <p sl="en">Ms Turunen, I gave an answer to Ms Steinruck a few minutes ago and I would like to repeat that now. We have a proposed date for college debate and adoption which will be in March 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are various reasons for the delay, not least because we had to accelerate some other initiatives like the Youth Opportunities, which I am sure you also consider very important. The Youth Opportunities were not originally on the agenda, but we had to respond to the urgency of youth unemployment, which is why we scheduled that for last December. There is also very serious work under way: serious coordination between our services on the question of the posting of workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you also suggested, this is a very complex matter, and I am very grateful for the contribution of many Members of the European Parliament to this discussion. You brought to my attention very difficult cases, not only those where the European Court of Justice made decisions which many of you saw as controversial, but also the more recent Flamanville case. Our intention is to eliminate the likelihood of a recurrence of such cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want posted workers to work in a safe, well-regulated environment with greater awareness of the circumstances and their own rights, and much better administrative cooperation between the Member States. This is covered in the documents we have been drawing up since last summer when we had the stakeholder conference last June. The structure, as I have already explained to Ms Steinruck, is an enforcement directive, in order to contribute to the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you probably know, this falls under the scope of the Single Market Act, as it concerns the single labour market, and also constitutes regulation to follow up on fundamental social rights with a view to having better guarantees in this area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the opportunity to pose questions on the Services Directive is very welcome. I and members of my committee are deeply engaged in following through the transposition. I want to thank the Commissioner for his energy in pursuing this.</p>
      <p sl="en">My question, however, is not so much related to the actual legal requirement on Member States to transpose the directive. My observation, based on visits to a number of countries and on talking both to governments and to business organisations, is that we have absolutely encouraged Member States to make a substantial investment in providing services – the points of single contact – with a view to opening up their markets to service providers from other countries, and also to support and train all their public authorities in accepting applications from other countries for the provision of services. But my experience is that most businesses who can potentially take advantage of this know nothing about it at all, because the one thing Member States have neglected is any promotion of these great new opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like the Commissioner’s reassurance, with regard to the benchmarking exercise, that we will actually have some real information on the ground about businesses’ awareness of the opportunities that have been created. Otherwise it is simply like saying to Member States that they should invest heavily in this great new product and new idea, but that they should not tell anyone about it. How is that a sensible strategy?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-071-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr Harbour just drew our attention to a very important point, which is the feeling that we sometimes have, here in Strasbourg, in Brussels and in the Member States, that there are two wheels turning at the same time: there is the legislative wheel which we in the Commission, Parliament and Council turn together, and there are the national wheels. What I have noticed, Mr Harbour, from my work at local level with these workshops I have just completed, is that we must connect the two wheels, not so that they turn together, but so that they work in connection with one another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">They work in connection with one another when texts are properly transposed. This is basically the case when texts are implemented effectively. This is not yet the case in all Member States. It is especially the case when those for whom we in Parliament, the Council and the Commission are working together to create these texts, that is to say businesses and particularly small and medium-sized businesses, or citizens, are aware of what we do for them, and this is not the case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, honourable Members, I attach so much importance to these local instruments. Almost two years ago, when you kindly agreed to the Commission’s investiture and questioned me at the hearing, I stated before you that during these five years our ambition, and this is very significant, would be to reconcile small and medium-sized enterprises and EU consumers with the single market. There is a sentiment that this single market was not created for them, and that it is for the big and powerful rather than small enterprises and consumers. We must change that. The Services Directive is one of the instruments which can help us to achieve this, along with a number of structures, the existence of which I am in the process of checking.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Internal Market Information System (IMI), which will be discussed again and which can also be employed for professional qualifications, allows direct interactive dialogue between local authorities via the Internet. Six thousand administrative bodies are now actively using this system.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is the Solvit system, which is now functioning properly in almost all Member States, to prevent discouragement and legal action, and to facilitate mediation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There are also, as Mr Harbour pointed out, the Points of Single Contact which are of great importance and which today exist in all Member States. I think I am safe in saying that there is only one country, Romania, in which the Points of Single Contact are not yet in operation. The Points of Single Contact are, in my opinion, an extremely important tool, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. Naturally, these points of contact must be equipped with essential features such as online and cross-border procedures. This is still far from the case. These Points of Single Contact are in place, but are not yet able to provide the full potential of which businesses are in need.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why in 2012, which as I said earlier will be the year of the Services Directive’s full implementation, I will, Mr Harbour, focus efforts particularly on the proper functioning of these Points of Single Contact with modern, digital means and proper information in their regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is another reason why, on Parliament’s initiative, we are going to organise the week for renewed growth together, from 15-22 October, at the same time as the European Week of Small and Medium Enterprises which is being organised by Mr Tajani. Together with the European Parliament, the national parliaments, chambers of commerce, trade unions and any organisations who wish to be involved, we are going to organise a European week on the Single Market Act and on all of the tools that I just mentioned. This will be a full week of people-oriented, rather than technocratic or bureaucratic, information on the single market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I want us to put a face to the single market, and to men and women who have succeeded and failed through it, and see how we can deal with these failures. That, Mr Harbour, will be the aim of the week which we are going to hold together in October of this year, and during which the focus will be on Points of Single Contact.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, while I am impressed, as always, by the energy behind the Commissioner’s words – and Commissioner Barnier and I work very closely together – I still do not think that he got to the heart of my question. When I go round talking to businesses, I have to tell them about the EUGO Portal. I have to give them the excellent brochure that the Commission has produced because, actually, my own Government is not doing very much, and I have said so to the Secretary of State.</p>
      <p sl="en">How are we going to reach governments and their small-enterprise divisions – and Mr Tajani is absolutely involved in this as our lead on SMEs – to tell them about these sources of information and how they can deploy them? The problem is that we have done all this great stuff but the people who are really going to energise the economy by investing and trading across borders, it seems to me, will not be sufficiently excited and energised to take advantage of it.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Harbour, no matter how much we do, it will never be enough to reach Europe’s 22 million businesses, 21 million of which, as you well know, are small and medium-sized enterprises on which commitments have been made and on which Mr Tajani’s work is focused. He could also express his view on this subject. I think that there is a need to diffuse information.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have devised this Single Market Week to promote renewed growth, as well as the European SME Week in October; I am also checking that the Points of Single Contact are in operation. We cannot do everything from here in Brussels. We need the involvement of Member States. We also need the cooperation of the chambers of commerce, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You mentioned the brochure which we have produced. We will probably produce others, and I will, either via the Internet or in person, request support from the chambers of commerce, for example, which have direct links with small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they can diffuse this information to their members and to the people on the ground responsible for creating employment and growth. This is something which cannot easily be done from Brussels and for which we need intermediaries and partners.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would therefore like us to have the opportunity, in 2012 and before October’s Single Market Week, to make sure that every business in the EU receives this basic information on the Services Directive and on the other actions we are taking, for example with regard to accounting standards or public procurement, which are aimed at encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises’ involvement.</p>

There is no shortage of worthwhile initiatives in the Member States, and SMEs can create jobs, but somehow or other, despite the Commission’s enthusiasm, the businesses are not getting the message.</p>

The Commission has been operating now for almost two and a half years: might not we in the internal market zone receive an interim report on how the SMA (Single Market Act) is working in practice?

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I should like to give out some information on the network dedicated precisely to providing information to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="it">By means of this network, we have a presence in 51 countries, with around 600 contact points and over 3 000 professionals to its credit. I would say that Enterprise Europe Network is the most important European, if not global, network helping small and medium-sized enterprises. We have a presence in all 27 Member States and in eight third countries taking part in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme. I am referring to Croatia, Israel and Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="it">Here are some additional figures on the advice and information provided, including that related to the internal market. Around 300 000 businesses have made direct use of this kind of service, while 600 000 others have taken part in events organised with the same objective; 225 000 have used the special advice service on subjects such as access to finance, intellectual property, business development at the European and international level, and innovation through the adoption of new work methods and new technologies.</p>
      <p sl="it">Every year, the network facilitates the conclusion of around 2 500 formal cross-border deals between businesses, giving them benefits in terms of maintaining turnover, employment and investment levels. We have also received 10 000 comments to date from businesses giving us their opinions on policy, legislative initiatives and European-level programmes.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think that amounts to an effective network, even if we consider – naturally – the need to implement and further strengthen its actions, since the continuation of the Enterprise Europe Network is also guaranteed in the framework of the Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs (COSME) 2014-2020.

      <p sl="fr">We have made progress in this area, since we are in the process right now of creating this observatory, via the Trademarks Office in Alicante, and giving it more powers. The observatory will look into problems such as piracy, of course, and the problem of counterfeiting in particular, in order to give us a clearer picture of the situation so that we can take the appropriate measures. These will not always, I may add, be enforcement measures: they will often involve explanation and training, in order to combat the counterfeiting to which very many small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe fall victim. It has been calculated that counterfeiting has caused the loss of 200 000 jobs across Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, as rapporteur for the Services Directive, I did ensure, at that time, that services of common economic interest and services of general interest were excluded from the scope of that directive. At the same time I said that it is absolutely necessary for these services to be regulated at European level in order to protect them. Since then, we have seen the advent of the Treaty of Lisbon and its supplementary Protocol No 26, which gives the Commission a duty. Commission President Barroso promised us that he would act in this regard and we await real and substantial action from the Commission in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">My question for you, Commissioner, is: when can we expect a legislative text from you? This is something that is needed, in my opinion. It is needed not because we want to regulate these services, but because we want to ensure that these services continue to remain in the hands of the competent people and bodies in the Member States, and with the highest possible level of quality.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Gebhardt, I am personally aware of how closely you monitor and follow this subject of services of general economic interest. I should also add that, going beyond social services of general interest, you and I share the same concern, since we are aiming at the same political goal for the sake of this competitive social market economy. This goal, which must be, or must become once again, the basis for European action, is to guarantee the quality, accessibility and sustainability of public services in Europe, and wherever necessary to adapt the existing legislation to the realities of the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have made a major commitment, which we are keeping through the Commission’s cross-cutting action on public services, to forge closer links between economic realities and freedom on the one hand and social realities on the other. I am thinking about fundamental social rights within the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We may argue and debate the issues among ourselves, but I think President Barroso has always been keen to talk about a quality framework. The forthcoming cross-cutting document to be presented by Commissioner Andor on the posting of workers ties in with this subject, as does the document presented by our colleague Mr Almunia on state aid, to which I also contributed. In particular, Ms Gebhardt, the ‘Almunia-Barnier package’ includes a document that clarifies the situation, and provides, for example, for a complete exemption from the state-aid notification procedure for public funding for healthcare services and essential social services, where these fall within the scope of EU law. This package is the second in this quality framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third package is the one I presented on the directives on public procurement and concession contracts, which I have ensured will play a very specific role in the whole area of invitations to tender and public procurement of social services, with higher thresholds and simplified procedural rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We do not think that an overall legislative framework is needed over and above the above-mentioned or future cross-cutting directives, and the vertical, or sectoral directives which, if one looks at the list, cover practically all services. Take, for example the Postal Directives, for which I am responsible. I am overseeing the implementation of the directive very closely, from now on in conjunction with users.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe these cross-cutting directives, with the improvements I have just spoken of and further consolidation by Parliament, together with the sectoral directives, make up the quality framework that President Barroso has undertaken before this House to establish or consolidate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, with respect, Commissioner, I do not see this the same way as you. What you have just presented is a breakdown of the legislation, and not the implementation of what is stipulated under Protocol No 26 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which quite clearly sets out that we need a legislative framework within which the protection of these services of general economic interest is to be regulated. That is something quite different to what you just presented to us I would like to know when you actually intend to implement the Treaty on European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We are aware of the Treaty, of course. The Commission’s primary role, Ms Gebhardt, is as guardian of the Treaty, and it must apply all aspects of it, although of course certain articles, such as Article 14, are debatable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What matters to me, with respect to those people who are anxious and vulnerable, and can see the effects that the economic crisis is having, is to preserve the fundamental services to which they are entitled. This is what matters to me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is, indeed, this debate about a framework directive, or a more overarching legal instrument. At this moment in time, thinking in practical terms about people’s anxiety and concerns, especially those about social services and healthcare, we feel that all the concrete, practical protection that citizens need is provided by the directives and cross-cutting texts I have mentioned, as well as the sectoral directives. The latter are also at issue and must be implemented or improved where necessary, but above all be properly drafted. We shall therefore be continuing the debate to see if more can be done; however, what matters to me is to guarantee these services and ensure that people are protected, especially the most isolated and vulnerable.</p>

      <p sl="it">I shall take the liberty, Commissioner, of returning to an issue already addressed a few months ago, during an identical Question Time, and that is the transposition and implementation procedure for the Late Payment Directive.</p>
      <p sl="it">Your reply at the time maintained that you had written to all the Member States and were waiting for the relevant confirmations. My questions are as follows: what stage have we reached? Have you received replies? Do you have information on individual countries and, most important, can you point out those countries that are in good order and those by contrast that are still taking their time?</p>

    <intervention id="2-093-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Antonio Tajani" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="it">Mr Baldassarre, access to credit is one of the fundamental requirements for the growth that we are discussing at length and on which Mr Barnier also spoke. This must be the subject of vigorous measures. I am personally drawing up a series of points to present to the College of Commissioners on the theme of growth, one of which will precisely be access to credit.</p>
      <p sl="it">Turning to the details of your question, we have already received replies from the Member States. A meeting took place in Brussels on 3 February this year with representatives from the 27 Member States. During this meeting, we received some comforting replies, others less so.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, Austria decided to transpose the Directive before summer 2012; Belgium before the end of 2012; Bulgaria by the end of summer 2012; Cyprus in summer 2012; and the Czech Republic in March 2013, which is the final deadline. The same can be said for Denmark. Estonia will adopt the Directive in March 2013; Finland for the end of 2012; France has assured us that it will proceed to transposition by March 2013; Germany by the first four months of 2012 (adoption by its Parliament); Greece will wait for March 2013, as will Hungary and Ireland; Italy will do so on 14 November 2012; Latvia in September 2012; Lithuania in autumn 2012; Luxembourg by the end of 2012; Malta has not yet set a date but will certainly comply with the deadline; the Netherlands will do so by summer 2012; Poland by the end of 2012; Portugal will do so at the end of March 2013; Romania in March 2013; Slovakia by the end of 2012; Slovenia did not attend the meeting; the Spanish Parliament will examine the text of the legislation in autumn 2012, following which, adoption will take place in March 2013; Sweden will adopt it by the end of 2012, whereas the United Kingdom has confirmed that the Directive will be transposed in March 2013. This is all the information I have concerning the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">I shall continue to ensure that the deadlines are respected, since I believe that an acceleration of the timetable is fundamental for small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in times of crisis, so that they can be paid not only by the public sector but also by larger suppliers.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the philosophy behind the Services Directive and the agreement we have reached state that workers are always covered by the labour and social law of their host country and not that of their country of origin. The current directive and subsequent legal rulings have undermined that principle, which has jeopardised workers’ fundamental rights and even essential rights.</p>
      <p sl="es">I listened to your replies to Ms Turunen and Ms Steinruck and I congratulate you because, finally, after managing to overcome the problems, we will have a directive and a regulation in March. However, what matters now, Mr Andor, is that these should not be just any directive or regulation but an outstanding directive and regulation that resolve these problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">So, Mr Andor, I am asking you now whether this directive and regulation are finally going to reflect reality: that workers should always be covered by the labour law and social law of the host country and never those of their country of origin, and first and foremost, that they should not be disadvantaged by companies’ freedom of establishment?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-095-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">As I have already mentioned, the intention of the Commission was not to reopen the original directive but to sustain it and support the implementation with a lot of clarifications. This also applies to the question of how core rights and social provisions are dealt with in the directive, because we have to distinguish between posted workers and those workers who have become integrated into the labour market of the host country. This is the fundamental distinction we have to make.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is nevertheless extremely important to ensure that what is guaranteed in the original directive is provided, and then also monitored in a transparent manner. We do indeed have to protect the rights and working conditions of posted workers as well. There also has to be closer and more reliable monitoring of those working conditions, but without undermining the practices themselves, without interventions that would threaten the free movement of services between European countries.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with your statement, but nor should we jeopardise the principle that workers should be covered by the legislation of the country where they work, and this principle should never be violated unless we want to destroy the European social model and our hopes.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will continue to support you, but the battle will not be won once we have a directive and a regulation, but only when we have the directive and the regulation that the citizens of Europe demand.</p>

      <p sl="en">As I said, on this particular question the original directive laid out the foundations which we are not going to change; that would certainly cause greater ambiguity about posting practices, rather than providing clarification</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important that regulations in the host countries include a core group of provisions on the posting of workers that apply to workers posted from another country who remain employees of a company that operates in a different Member State. This also has to be taken into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not an easy question, but we have to be attentive to two sides of the issue: posted workers are employees from Member State A, but they act and work in Member State B. We have to choose carefully what applies to the regulation of employment in the light of this dual nature of posted workers.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, Commissioner, you have raised an important matter, that of fake brands. If you will allow me, I would like to extend this Services Directive issue to the matter of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).</p>
      <p sl="fi">The EU has just concluded an international agreement that has been harshly criticised. It was negotiated with great secrecy. Commissioner Barnier, do you think that ACTA strikes the right balance between the protection of trademarks and the individual rights of users of the Internet? In my opinion, this has to do with the subject being discussed. I will repeat the question, since there was some commotion there. Has the recently negotiated Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement struck the right balance between the protection of trademarks and the individual rights of Internet users?</p>

    <intervention id="2-099-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Madam, this is an important subject; in fact I referred to it here in Parliament yesterday during the debate on the internal market. Our colleague Karel De Gucht is in charge of this subject. What I can say about the ACTA agreement under discussion is that we really must look at it objectively, and not become embroiled in passionate arguments and polemics.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission supports ACTA because, based on a legal analysis, it believes the agreement complies with the body of EU law, which in turn complies with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It also believes the agreement is compatible with all the work we do in the area of e -commerce. Therefore, we are glad that the subject is being discussed, as this is only right and democratic. However, let us not get involved in pointless polemics or fears on behalf of consumers and citizens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should also point out that you will have several opportunities to debate the issue, at the end of February or beginning of March, and most importantly, I think a major public hearing is planned for early March.

    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-101-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Michel Barnier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">I understand and agree that it is quite proper that there should be a debate, since there are concerns among consumers, citizens and Internet users.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, we are all responsible for implementing international agreements on intellectual property rights which ensure there is a level playing field and fair treatment when it comes to protecting these rights. We all know, madam, that they are a key factor for growth. I think everyone on these benches is unanimous on this point, although there may be some differences of opinion on how to go about it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Creativity, invention, art and innovation must be properly protected and remunerated. At the same time, as I said yesterday, it is important for this intellectual property to keep up with the times. At the moment, this means with the European dimension at the very least, and that of the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We took note of the concerns expressed by your President, Mr Schulz, of course, and I can reiterate that based on a legal analysis and on the work we have carried out, we believe the text complies with the body of EU law and respects citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I too would like to go back to the results of implementing the Services Directive in the countries of the EU. This has become a hot topic again, not so much because we are coming to the end of the two-year period for the Commission to present its report on implementation of the directive, but because the directive has led to a lot of problems in many countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, the most prominent issue concerns the application of derogations to the authorisation system, which are provided for where the system is not discriminatory or is justified on public interest grounds and meets the proportionality criterion.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission’s rigid application – or, rather, interpretation – of the derogation provisions stands in contrast to measures on safeguarding trust and on legal certainty. Furthermore, in combination with the measures on licensing and public procurement – even in the latest version proposed by the Commission, which excludes the licensing of activities in public areas from its provisions – it reveals a regulatory vacuum at EU level, which has thrown major sectors into chaos, as has happened with beach establishment operators in Italy, tulip growers in the Netherlands and Christmas market traders in Germany, to mention just a few.</p>
      <p sl="it">Does the Commission not think that intervention is needed to properly regulate free competition, to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises and to preserve the character of certain sectors that are important to many Member States?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Mazzoni, I am very familiar with the initial version of the directive, as I was a member of the European Commission at the time the Commission proposed it. It is something of an understatement to say that, at the initiative of Ms Gebhardt, Mr Schwab and many others among you, the directive has been extensively amended, improved and clarified, especially the sections on protecting social services. This is a good thing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was two years ago yesterday, 10 February, that I returned to the Commission, where I am now responsible for the internal market and services. You have every right to ask the question, and as part of my job I have the duty to implement the directive in its current state as adopted by Parliament, with respect to the sectors that it covers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You mentioned tulip producers in the Netherlands, for example. As for your own country, when I visited the Italian Parliament where I met various committees, many Italian MPs and senators brought up the subject of beach-concession holders, which is a sensitive issue in Italy. I could quote other cases also.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I did not think up this directive. I am not going to say that we shall add or remove this or that occupation. It covers some occupations, and does not cover others. In fact, there are very few now – security services and online gambling – that are not covered by European legislation. This is so for the time being, at any rate, since, as regards online gambling, we shall be bringing in legislation and taking steps with the action plan. Everything else is covered in one way or another, either by a cross-cutting directive or a sectoral directive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, I am obliged to oversee the proper implementation of the directive, whilst maintaining the principle of proportionality, as you mentioned yourself. My staff and I are prepared to go through the cases that pose the most problems with a fine-toothed comb. I said so in the case of beach-concession holders, and I can say it for other occupations also. Nonetheless, the occupations that are covered by this directive must abide by it and must develop within the framework of the directive’s provisions. I am able to say this much. I can confirm to you that I am willing to work on individual cases, with a pragmatic, non-ideological approach. However, my job is to implement the directive as intelligently and speedily as possible.</p>

I know him well; he was a member of the European Commission himself for ten years, and therefore a guardian of the Treaties, as we are now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The work that is currently in the pipeline, in which I am involved, is practical, pragmatic, thorough work to ensure that this Directive, which covers beach concessions, can be applied to this sector whilst taking account, in an intelligent way, of the needs of the tourism sector, of which I am well aware.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Morganti, in a previous role, I was responsible for a region that is one of France’s biggest tourist areas, and I am aware of the importance of the tourism market. However, at the same time, there is no reason why the Services Directive should not be applied to those involved in this field of market competition, whilst taking into consideration the specific features of particular occupations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, there is a location within the territory of the European Union, in Cyprus to be precise, where barbed wire surrounds an area containing thousands of empty houses, churches, schools, kindergartens, sports fields and children’s playgrounds. The inhabitants of that town dream of the day when they will be able to return to their childhood haunts. Assistance from international institutions, and in particular the European Parliament, is necessary and vital if these dreams are to become a reality. I would like to thank you all very much for this assistance on my own behalf and on behalf of all those who signed Written Declaration No 0042, and in particular on behalf of the inhabitants of Famagusta, their children and their grandchildren. I believe that this document will motivate the European Commission, the Member States, the UN and especially the government of Turkey to work more closely together and to take further action on this matter.</p>

There is little reward in investing in high-quality research in a region when there is little or no enforcement of these intellectual property rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although I am still to be convinced of the need for a new EU institution to be tasked with data collection and exchange of good practice, I am prepared to support this initiative so long as it will provide a robust and efficient method to deal with infringements of intellectual property rights in the internal market. This seems a necessary move by the EU to ensure that intellectual property rights are well protected and that best practice for the enforcement and harmonising of these intellectual property rights is delivered for businesses operating in the EU as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the increase in intellectual property infringements observed in recent years threatens to undermine the strategy on intellectual property rights in the single market that was launched by the Commission in May 2011.</p>
      <p sl="it">To combat such infringements and ensure the success of the intellectual property protection policy, it has been proposed that the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market be entrusted with certain tasks relating to the running of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, set up in 2009. The purpose of this is to provide the Observatory with the human and financial resources to combat intellectual property infringements and to conduct campaigns to raise public awareness of the risks of buying counterfeit products.</p>

Its main objectives are to increase awareness in the public and private sectors of the impact of counterfeiting and piracy and to inform consumers of the dangers of buying counterfeit goods.</p>
      <p sl="it">Agreement was reached at first reading on 19 December, on the basis of 33 compromise amendments. The amendments mean that the title of the regulation and the name of the Office are not changed in line with the European Observatory.

The Commission proposal is closely connected with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). However, it does not only concern the fight against counterfeiting and piracy on the Internet. It will lead to an improvement in the understanding of the overall scope and impact of infringements of intellectual property rights. I consider this beneficial. Raising public awareness of the value of authorship is very important for a wider understanding of the need to protect intellectual property rights. This will contribute to the promotion and maintenance of economic growth. The Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market should also monitor the development of competitive new business models. It would thereby support not only the exchange of information between Member State institutions, but also public awareness.</p>

So far the Observatory has not produced any significant results and has been unable to effectively carry out its remit because it has lacked sufficient human, financial and practical resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">My vote is therefore intended to help revive the Observatory; once it is made dependent on the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, it will be able to make use of the Office’s financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="it">To conclude, in order to effectively revitalise the work of the Observatory, the Office must be provided with appropriate professional resources and knowledge as well as indispensable technical expertise, including that to be found in the Member States’ own intellectual property authorities. This will enable it to effectively exercise its new powers associated with the running of the Observatory and perform these duties with the same commitment and concern for every intellectual property right recognised at EU level, without imposing any hierarchical order when safeguarding such rights.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, infringements of intellectual property rights have become increasingly frequent, causing considerable financial losses to the cultural and creative sectors. During this time the activities of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Privacy established by the Commission have multiplied. For that reason I voted in favour of the regulation, that is for the observatory to be run by the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market. The merger will also result in budgetary savings. In drafting the report, the rapporteur included the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, which means the cultural dimensions of intellectual property rights were also put forward. The proposals of the European Parliament therefore show the emphasis that we place on promoting new business models that expand the legal supply of cultural and creative content, as well as the fact that we wish to protect the intellectual property rights of small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today I am happy to support giving legal effect to a European observatory to assist with combating the infringement of intellectual property rights (IPR). The observatory will be effective in dealing with infringement because until now there has been a severe shortage of information for tackling counterfeiting and piracy. It also brings harmonisation across Member States, meaning that the EU can become a more effective machine when it comes to IPR and infringement.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is, however, important that the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market can work closely with the Member States, as well as private industry and the Commission, to tackle infringement. Without such cooperation, duplication could potentially harm progress, and in a supportive role a European observatory can help bring real value to IPRs.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can also save the EU budget, and indeed taxpayers, some much-needed money in these difficult financial times by entrusting the Office of Harmonisation with this very important task. I have also called for a focus, not just on counterfeiting and piracy, but also on other types of infringement. I welcome this vote today.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this report on interconnection of central, commercial and companies’ registers seems to incorporate the primary aims of the single market. The existing system of having separate national regional business registers has proved quite cumbersome over the years and has often seen a great variance in the type and quality of data being stored. This can make it difficult to interpret for businesses hoping to engage in cross-border trades as data cannot always be relied upon.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal to create a single EU register for businesses to provide a platform where companies themselves can access information on other EU companies – thus facilitating cross-border trade – is one that I can support. It could potentially save time and money for European businesses as trading partner information would be accessible in a more efficient and timely manner. Importantly, this proposal needs to ensure no additional burden of red tape is placed on our companies whilst facilitating the overarching objective of completing the single market.</p>

We believe that these measures should be put in place as an important network to help businesses which are seeking to trade across EU borders.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, finding out the facts and figures about a business through legally regulated disclosure systems is an essential factor in ensuring that the markets operate efficiently and in accordance with the law.

The most important one in my country, Italy, is the companies’ register, which all companies operating in Italy have to join.</p>

In the next decade it is essential to improve EU research results and ensure greater application of smart products and services in the market. The successful creation of a single market for research will depend on guaranteeing effective protection of intellectual property rights. The recent increase in intellectual property rights infringements (a study conducted in 2010 indicates that EUR 10 billion and more than 185 000 jobs were lost due to piracy in the music, movie, TV, and software industries in the EU in 2008) is reducing investments in innovations, killing jobs, threatening the health and safety of European consumers and preventing small and medium-sized enterprises from developing.

Every year this problem causes our businesses to become less competitive, puts the health and safety of millions of European consumers at risk, cheats the Member States’ coffers of slices of their revenue, and erodes parts of the European labour market. Moreover, this thriving activity, which is increasingly difficult to control, subsidises organised crime.

The imitation of goods and works governed by an intellectual property scheme relates, firstly, to the distribution of work at global level and, secondly, to creativity, as shaped by the spread of new technologies, with radically different conditions of production and consumption. The inability to recognise and manage issues relating to outdated materials and unprofitable intangible resources negates the contraction sought by the term ‘intellectual property’. Creating and strengthening an organisation to monitor such rights, in view of the ACTA trade agreement, which also contracts disparate problems, to the point at which it goes beyond fundamental democratic rights and functions, will turn the observatory into a police body to monitor citizens’ private lives and communications and undermine creativity and innovation in the Union. The possible cooperation between this body and private firms paves the way for the policing of citizens’ public and private life by private individuals, a prospect which is incompatible with democratic principles and values.

That is why the Commission’s proposal for a regulation entrusting the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market with the operation of the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy is a move in the right direction, as this merger will allow the Observatory to access the financing and infrastructure needed in order to perform the tasks and activities, while at the same time benefiting from the expertise of the Office for Harmonisation, thereby saving approximately EUR 40 000 to the EU budget.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The economic welfare of the European Union depends on the maintenance of its creativity, cultural diversity and capacity for innovation – driving forces of the knowledge society. That is why the protection of intellectual property rights is equally beneficial to companies, innovators, and consumers as well as to parties interested in cultural creation. Over recent years, there has been an increase in copyright abuse and in the trade in counterfeit and pirated goods, which, as well as causing inherent economic damage, is also morally reprehensible and a punishable civil act. The digital economy has seen a rise in the number of violations of intellectual property rights due to falsification, unauthorised copying and piracy, and these are extremely damaging to the creative and cultural economy of the European Union. It is for these reasons that I have voted in favour of the present report, which aims to implement measures to combat this scenario.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The technological revolution that we have been experiencing has led to a redefinition of the notion of wealth: this concept, traditionally identified with land ownership, has begun to be associated above all with credit, and today there is also a move towards advocating the exclusive use of ideal entities. It is impossible nowadays to think of exclusive use of specific assets without considering intellectual property rights, especially in their economic dimension: this is a major reason for engaging in innovation and development activities. Without this level of protection, which offers the possibility of a return on investment, it is unlikely that companies would embark on the process of creating new products and services with the same impetus. Therefore the proposal to integrate the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy in the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market is admirable, seeking as it does to aggregate the Observatory’s activities with the Office’s know-how and financial resources. It thus provides for a reinforcement of the detection and prevention of piracy cases, which not only have an economic impact but may also jeopardise consumer protection. Thus I have voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The problem of counterfeiting and piracy is becoming ever more serious, and the ensuing costs for the European economy are difficult to estimate. They are certainly of the order of billions of euros. Some of the consequences of counterfeiting and piracy becoming more widespread are a reduction of investment in innovation which in turn leads to job losses, the health and safety of consumers being put at risk in Europe, the national budgets of Member States losing income from tax, and a rise in organised crime. A long-term consequence for the entire EU is the threat posed to one of the priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy, namely smart growth. An effective policy for the protection of intellectual property certainly has a very important part to play in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market was created in 1995 and tasked with managing a register of all Community trade marks and designs. Its remit in the area of intellectual property rights should now be broadened. This has become necessary because of the nature of its tasks to date and the particular features of the common market. By managing a database of protected trade marks and designs, the Office will be able to deal effectively with the phenomena of counterfeiting and piracy.</p>

      <p sl="hu">A single company register would help not only shoppers, but would also have significant benefits for enterprises too, since free-of-charge access would save them considerable time and costs. That could even mean savings of tens of millions of euros. At present, the fact that the companies registers of some Member States only contain certain types of data; that information is not always updated; that access is cumbersome; and that there is frequently a lack of translated information, causes a lot of difficulties for those in the business world. In my view, further integration of the internal market in this field needs to be the foremost priority for these reasons, which is why it is important to eliminate existing legal and practical hurdles as quickly as possible. Today more and more companies are advertising their services beyond national borders, resulting in substantial growth of the number of online shoppers within the European Union. For the security of shoppers, a system making it possible to check the legal operation of the companies in question needs to be established. The aim of the proposal being debated is precisely that of increasing legal security and the transparency of the legal relationship between shoppers and companies, which is why I support the proposal.</p>

The European Union must make use of the opportunities offered by technology to develop the internal market. Through the use of newer technologies, the system of interconnection of registers brought in by this proposal for a directive will encourage cross-border cooperation between businesses, new cross-border investment and the creation of new jobs. The proposal for a directive is a step towards reducing red tape for businesses that would like to work together with businesses from another Member State. The minimum requirements set down in the proposal for a directive for the pan-European platform, through which registers will be able to exchange information, make it clear for businesses what information it will be possible to obtain about a business from another Member State. For example, before entering into an agreement with a business in another Member State, it is important for any business to be sure that the other has not been liquidated. For this reason I am convinced that the proposal for a directive will create an additional incentive for cross-border cooperation and for the creation of new jobs, which are so vital for the economies of European countries.</p>

The interconnection of commercial registers is an extremely necessary and long-awaited measure to further the development of the European Union economic area and increase legal certainty among citizens and companies. Considering the economic situation in recent years in the European Union and in its Member States, there has been a significant increase in the need to ensure and increase legal certainty when it comes to cross-border economic activities. Thus, it is important that a company in one Member State should be able to verify the legal status of its business partner and obtain information about that business partner, as this would increase the availability of data. Although this directive is quite technical in nature and deals with the interconnection of various countries’ registers and the exchange of information between them, it has a significant influence on the development of the EU’s internal market and is therefore of far greater importance than one may initially think.

      <p sl="fr">Guinea-Bissau is a struggling country despite its wealth of assets, such as its natural resources or its vast potential in terms of agricultural and fishery resources. The European Union and Guinea-Bissau have long-standing agreements regarding the fisheries sector. I was in favour of renewing the agreement under which European fishermen, mainly the French, Portuguese and Spanish can come and fish in the territorial waters of Guinea-Bissau in return for an annual fee of EUR 9.2 million. The previous agreement only covered 7.5 million per year but this year, EUR 3 million will support the development of fishing and help this country strengthen one of its assets.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted in favour of this resolution. A new protocol needs to be signed between Guinea-Bissau and the European Union. The protocol will accompany the Fisheries Partnership Agreement signed between the two parties in 2008. The overall production from industrial fishery in the Guinea-Bissau region was estimated at 53 000 tonnes. Half of the production in this area is made up of small pelagic fish. The capacity to provide monitoring, control and surveillance of fisheries, as well as sanitary inspections must be improved. I should point out that it is important for the EU to monitor the Guinea-Bissau authorities’ respect for human rights. I welcome the inclusion of additional clauses in the protocol concerning the suspension and revision of financial compensation. These clauses must be applied when human rights and democratic principles are violated.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On 17 March 2008, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 241/2008 on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for a period of four years, tacitly renewable, unless either party terminates it. The FPA has supported the presence of the EU fleet in West Africa, created employment and provided additional fish supplies for the EU market. It has also proved relevant to Guinea-Bissau’s needs, both as a major contribution to budgetary and macroeconomic stability and in terms of national fisheries policy, since it finances major measures to support the economic development and sustainability of the fishing sector. It therefore appears to be in the interests of both parties to conclude a new protocol and this resolution recommends that the European Parliament approves its conclusion. Concerns over the need for better monitoring of resources using the best available scientific advice should be taken on board during negotiations, by speeding up the work programme of the Joint Scientific Committee. On these grounds I voted for the recommendation.</p>

A feature of such agreements is that they both safeguard fish stocks through regulated fishing and create jobs and provide economic support in places that need European economic assistance. In this particular case, the agreement with Guinea-Bissau provides for the renewal of the previous partnership for one year to give both parties time to draw up a new protocol of understanding valid for four years.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted against this measure, as I fear European involvement in the fisheries sector of Guinea-Bissau. Guinea-Bissau is one of the least developed economies in the world. One third of GDP comes directly from foreign aid. While I support the notion of aiding Guinea-Bissau to develop self-sufficiency across the maritime and agrarian sectors, the EU has no track history of having a beneficial presence in third-country waters. On the whole, foreign EU vessels pillage the fish stocks of third countries in return for financial hand-outs which result in long-term lasting damage to the fisheries sector, destroying entire subsistence communities. It is hardly surprising that the contract allows for no fewer than 20 Spanish vessels to operate within the area. I am disgusted that the European Union would seek to take advantage of fish stocks in such a deprived country due to the EU’s own dwindling reserves as a result of over-fishing, and operate under the guise of development assistance. Instead Member States should be individually seeking to help Guinea-Bissau develop their maritime industry to enable them to trade independently with the wider world at a fair market price, not paying for our own vessels to trawl their waters dry.</p>

I commend this protocol because it permits fishing for tuna (Spain, France and Portugal), shrimp (Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal), fish and octopus (Spain, Italy, and Greece), in exchange for payments of EUR 7 million, of which 35% would go to help Guinea-Bissau develop a sustainable and responsible fishing industry.

      <p sl="ro">Guinea-Bissau is one of the least developed countries in the world, hugely dependent on the support of international donors which provide almost a third of its national income. Therefore, the EU, its main donor, provides a tenth of this state’s national income with an annual contribution of around EUR 100 million. In these circumstances, support must continue to be provided in promoting the sustainability of fisheries resources in Guinea-Bissau. It is important to include additional clauses in this new protocol, stipulating that any violation of human rights in Guinea-Bissau may result in the payment of the EU’s financial contribution being suspended, in accordance with Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement. I also believe that closer monitoring is required of problems which persist, such as illegal fishing, due to inadequate surveillance, increasing levels of discards of undersized species and of non-commercial species, non-compliance with EU sanitary rules, affecting bilateral trade, as well as non-compliance with reporting conditions imposed on EU vessels. Last but not least, I am concerned, in connection with this report, by the way in which the European Commission has decided to cooperate with Parliament and respect the latter’s decision-making role.</p>

The protocol allows EU vessels to continue fishing in Guinea-Bissau waters for an additional year, up to a maximum of 37 authorisations for tuna vessels and an annual reference tonnage of 8 800 gross registered tonnage for trawlers. Four licences are allocated to Portugal, for tuna vessels and shrimp trawlers. Aside from the specifics of negotiating this new protocol, I believe it is important to highlight that the scientific opinion on the sustainability of exploiting the fishery resources in Guinea-Bissau waters at the current level of fishing suggests it is sustainable for a number of species. I also consider it important to highlight that two safeguard clauses have been included in the areas of respect for human rights and democratic principles, and of promoting improvements in the sanitary conditions of the sector will be promoted as a way to develop the sector as a whole nationally. Agreed payments can be suspended if it is found these clauses are not being respected.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Following negotiations between the European Commission and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, a new protocol entered force for one year from 16 June 2011, the previous protocol having expired on 15 June 2011. Guinea-Bissau is a tropical West African country with limited natural resources and a population estimated at around 1.6 million. It is one of the least developed and poorest countries in the world. The economy is largely agricultural, with a high dependency on the export of a single crop, cashew. The country is extremely dependent on donor support; the major donor is the EU, which in 2008 provided about one third of the international donor assistance. The potentially beneficial trade with the EU in fishery products is prevented due to non-compliance with EU sanitary measures. At the same time, Guinea-Bissau has many fishery resources, both coastal and oceanic species. Catches from the artisanal sector have recently been estimated to be in the range of 30 000 to 50 000 tonnes per year.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In 2008, the European Union and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau concluded a fisheries partnership agreement, accompanied by a protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial compensation for the period from June 2007 to June 2011. In June 2011, another protocol was agreed for one year to give time to negotiate a future protocol of longer duration. This new protocol includes additional clauses concerning the suspension and revision of financial compensation and the suspension of its implementation in case of breach of human rights and democratic principles. The new financial contribution is equivalent to EUR 7 million per year of support to Guinea-Bissau fisheries policy and to the sustainability of its fisheries resources, and EUR 500 000 to improve sanitary conditions in the fishing sector. As Portugal has historical links with this African country, this new protocol represents new fishing opportunities for Portuguese vessels and, simultaneously, development support to the Guinea-Bissau fisheries sector.

The European Union justifies these proposals by claiming that greater cooperation with Morocco itself will result in better governance of the Euro-Mediterranean area. However, the EU’s inertia in the face of the problems of summer 2011, when thousands of illegal immigrants took advantage of the chaos in North Africa to cross the Mediterranean and flood over the coasts of Italy, shows that the numerous agreements that have so far been signed with our so-called ‘Mediterranean partners’ are totally worthless to the EU and are unable to ensure any kind of ‘Euro-Mediterranean governance’. Instead, the Mediterranean area seems to be ‘strategic’ only to the countries of North Africa, which are benefiting more and more from the unjustified concessions that the EU is signing over to them, while the Member States of the EU itself, and Italy most of all, are finding themselves increasingly stripped of their ability to protect their own territories, their trade and their rights.

The experience of the European Communities shows that economic cooperation, by creating ties of interdependence and reciprocity among peoples, provides an ideal means for pursuing certain essential aims of the Community project, such as the defence of fundamental human rights, of the rule of law and of the democratic legitimisation of governments. We must therefore applaud the adoption of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Union and its Member States on the one hand and the Kingdom of Morocco on the other, covering the general principles for the Kingdom of Morocco’s participation in Union programmes.

Bluetongue is a disease that mainly affects ruminant animals such as sheep, goats and cows, and may take on epidemic proportions under the right environmental and climatic conditions, particularly in late summer and early autumn. Although there is no record of human infection, it is vital to implement measures leading to its eradication. In November 2010, the European Union adopted a series of measures to eradicate it: specifically, a vaccination plan using what is known as ‘active immunisation’. However, what is known as ‘passive immunisation’ has been developed in recent years; in contrast to the older type, this can be used outside areas subject to restrictions. In view of the technological and scientific innovation in veterinary terms, I voted for this recommendation because it will make the vaccination programme against bluetongue more efficient, so reducing the costs to the farming sector of this disease.</p>

These are pertinent reasons for welcoming the report. The Council agrees with the objectives proposed by the Commission and has adopted most of the amendments proposed by Parliament.

In order to ensure better control of the spread of bluetongue and to reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by the disease, it is right to amend the current rules for vaccination laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC in order to take account of the latest improvement in vaccine production technology. The amendments set out in this Directive should render the rules on vaccination more flexible, and should also take into account the availability of inactivated vaccines that can be used successfully outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions.

It is a notifiable animal disease, but it cannot be transmitted to humans and, therefore, is not dangerous to them. It has become clear that the serious impact which the vaccine has on animals can be identified immediately after vaccination. Vaccinated animals can suffer from a reduction in milk yield, diarrhoea and general poor health. More importantly, stillbirths have also been reported. In the case of goats, kids which suckled from newly vaccinated mothers have died. Furthermore, the vaccination affects not only farmers, but also consumers. Unless they stop eating meat and dairy products, they will be consuming the poisonous bluetongue vaccine. In addition, experts have told me that vaccination may well make it impossible to identify the real agents which cause the disease.

      <p sl="de">Almost a year ago, the first reading of the amendments to the directive on vaccinating against bluetongue took place in the European Parliament. The aim was to be able to apply the new regulations in the 2011 vaccination season. The delays in dealing with this issue in the Council have resulted in it only being possible to introduce the proposed changes during the 2012 vaccination season at the earliest. The agreement that we have now reached is entirely due to the European Parliament’s willingness to compromise. The fact that the Council only blocked the adoption of the amendment because there was a demand for correlation tables to provide proof that the amendment had been implemented in national regulations is both regrettable and negligent. Because of Parliament’s readiness to compromise, bluetongue has been successfully combated and the interests of farmers have been protected. I am now calling on the Member States to begin implementing the new regulations as quickly as possible. Preventive vaccination without the undesirable risk of the virus used in the vaccine coming into circulation will prevent farmers from suffering losses and put an end to restrictions on trade. The amendment to the directive highlights the paradigm shift in the European animal health strategy, which has moved from culling to vaccination.</p>

Bluetongue especially affects ruminants, such as cattle, sheep and goats, and leads to a marked increase in mortality and in disruption of economic activity within the agricultural sector. Following the outbreaks, which have been occurring frequently since 2000, the EU has approved specific measures to control the disease, especially a policy of vaccination. Here, attention must be drawn to inactivated vaccines, which pose no risk to other communities unaffected by the disease.

      <p sl="sk">The creation of an integrated market for electronic payments in euros, with no basic distinction between national and cross-border payments is necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. To this end, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project aims to develop common Union-wide payment instruments to replace current national payment instruments. SEPA should provide Union citizens and businesses with secure, competitively priced, user-friendly, and reliable payment services in euros. At the same time there is an assumption that favourable conditions will be created for increased competition in payment services and for the unhindered development and swift implementation of payments-related innovations. A subsequent increase in savings can be expected, mainly due to increased operating efficiency. Downward price pressure should be created across the board, which should be significant in particular in Member States where payments are, comparatively speaking, relatively expensive. The success of SEPA is very important from an economic, monetary and also political perspective. It is fully in line with the Europe 2020 strategy, the aim of which is a more intelligent economy.

The examination of the Member States’ draft National Reform Programmes contained in the draft Joint Employment Report shows that Member States should continue to make every effort to address the priority areas of increasing labour market participation and reducing structural unemployment, developing a skilled workforce responding to labour market needs and promoting job quality and lifelong learning, improving the performance of education and training systems at all levels and increasing participation in tertiary education, and promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. The Employment Guidelines adopted in 2010 should remain stable until 2014 to ensure a focus on implementation. Until the end of 2014 their updating should remain strictly limited.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Commission would like to replace national euro payment systems with a European system. The Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA for short) is based on the development of common payment services at European Union level, aimed at replacing current national payment services. In a nutshell, this means that national and cross-border payments, bank transfers and direct debits should come under the same legal system. There are numerous problems relating to differences between payments in the European Union. I endorse this initiative and would like consumer rights to be protected. This initiative should simplify the whole process and help enhance competition, which would normally result in a drop in service prices.</p>

We have made considerable progress in the area of uniformity in the EU as far as the free movement of goods and people is concerned, but regarding what is perhaps one of the simplest matters, cross-border payments, things have just got ridiculous. Payment practices in the different Member States have varied enormously, and when bills have been paid from one country to another, people have not always been able to rely on the fact that they have been sent to the right address. Sometimes, recipients have even been unable to locate payments automatically in their account. In future, it will no longer matter in which EU country someone has their bank account: matters will be dealt with in exactly the same way as in that person’s own country.

With the introduction of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA), the making of a payment through a credit transfer to foreign states will become equivalent to the same transaction carried out in a person’s own country of origin. This involves benefits both to enterprises, which will reduce their operating costs, with an estimated saving of between EUR 100 million and EUR 300 million in six years, and to citizens, who will see simplifications to many financial transactions, which are now increasingly common and widespread in a globalised market.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, the food distribution programme to benefit the most deprived persons within the European Union already has a rich history. It was launched in 1987, when the Council decided to make available to the Member States agricultural products from intervention stores so they could be used to provide food aid for the poorest persons. When intervention food stocks decreased in subsequent years, the purchase of food products on the market for the same purpose was authorised.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The development of agricultural policy resulted in a reduction of intervention stores, and consequently in the need to purchase more food products on the market for this programme. A case against acquiring food by purchasing it on the market was taken to the Court of Justice. On 20 April 2011 the Court ruled that this was contrary to the legal basis and that the programme should be restricted only to food drawn from the intervention stores. This meant that as of 1 January 2012 the programme would have been reduced from EUR 500 million per year to a little over EUR 100 million. Subsequently the European Parliament took strong action and, in its resolution of 7 July 2011, called on the Commission and on the Council to devise solutions for the years 2012–2013 as a matter of urgency, to prevent such a dramatic reduction of this programme.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be recalled that the Council did not accept the Commission’s initial proposal of September 2008 or Parliament’s position of March 2009. The Commission’s subsequent approach, which entailed providing a legal base for the programme through social policy and not just through the common agricultural policy, also failed to obtain sufficient support in the Council. It was only the decisive action taken by the Polish Presidency that removed the blocking minority and allowed work to speed up. A trialogue took place on 6 December 2011 at which Parliament and the Commission accepted the Council’s position. At an extraordinary meeting in Strasbourg on 12 December 2011, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development then accepted the outcome of the trialogue. The Council’s Special Committee on Agriculture gave its consent on the same day. This compromise received final confirmation from the Council at its meeting on 23 January 2012.Subsequently, on 26 February, Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development expressed its full support for the compromise adopted by the Council and accepted the request for the Council’s position to go through the adoption procedure before the plenary of the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It should be borne in mind that that position concerns implementation of the programme for the period 2012–2013. The sum of EUR 500 million will be maintained, and this is a very significant sum. The legal base for implementation of the programme will remain the common agricultural policy. The European Parliament’s request for the programme’s requirements to be met with European products in the first instance is honoured. Agreement for full Community funding was given. The institutions distributing the food were required to provide comprehensive information about the source of the support being European Union funds.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today’s discussion is taking place after yesterday’s debate on the situation of the homeless, most of whom need this free food. After all, it is now winter. The crisis affecting our countries is felt most strongly by the poorest persons, who are the main beneficiaries of food aid in the framework of this programme. In total, almost 18 million Europeans benefit from it. They are the persons who find it hardest to survive, such as the homeless I referred to earlier, the unemployed, the elderly, the disabled and also large families and single parents. Europe has enlarged significantly, and the number of poor and needy individuals has increased significantly. It is estimated that approximately 40 million persons in Europe are currently living below the poverty line, and that a further 40 million are in danger of slipping below it. The programme has been warmly welcomed by charitable institutions and NGOs involved in food distribution, but what is most important is that poor and needy persons are being helped. It is good that the European Union remembers them. That is why we must do all we can to prepare a suitable legal base for the implementation of this programme in the period 2014–2020.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am thrilled that a solution could be found for the 2012 and 2013 plans, enabling us to continue with this programme.</p>
      <p sl="fr">May I remind you that after over three years of intense negotiations between the institutions, we finally managed – as Mr Siekierski pointed out – to give this programme a new legal framework for the years 2012 and 2013, which were no longer covered as a result of the Court of Justice ruling.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I surely do not need to remind you that the European Union is going through one of the worst economic crises in decades and that, unfortunately, the number of citizens having to rely on food aid is increasing exponentially. We therefore had a political and civic duty to provide an immediate response to the needs of the poorest people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament as a whole, and in particular those Members who personally got very involved in ensuring the continuation of these programmes. It is also thanks to your strong support that a compromise on this complicated issue could be found, and in particular your persistence and your extremely clear stance on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Member States, which, in a manner reflecting a true European spirit, worked to finally reach a political compromise.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission therefore supports the results of the inter-institutional negotiations and may accept the Council’s position at first reading to ensure the continuation of the scheme until 2013. As you know, the Commission has worked hard to make this agreement possible. I would remind you that, since our initial proposal in 2008, we have proposed a number of adjustments to the regulatory text to try and satisfy the expectations and objections from some Member States as well as the calls from the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now that there is finally a qualified majority in favour of continuing the programme for a transitional period until 2013, we have the political agreement and, after the decision, the legal basis to continue this programme in 2012 and 2013 within the common agricultural policy thereby preventing the programme from coming to an abrupt end. Once the regulation is adopted, my staff will do their utmost to ensure that additional resources for the 2012 and 2013 plans are committed as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">First of all, I am happy, then I start asking questions and finally I start worrying.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased that, this year and next, Europeans in need will still have food to eat thanks to the European aid programme for the most deprived. Our fellow citizens would obviously not have understood why nothing was being done to release such necessary funds when we have recently learned that EUR 82 billion of European funds lies dormant in the Union’s coffers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then I start asking questions and finally I start worrying. I question the future of the food distribution programme. How can we conceive depriving some 13 million Europeans in need of food from 2014 onwards? Besides which, how many will be in need of it by then?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that solutions exist. We should therefore call on the Council to shoulder its responsibilities and preserve this fund during the next multiannual financial framework. If this does not happen, it will all dramatically backfire for sure. We need to accept this compromise but together reaffirm our commitment to the food distribution programme.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Naturally I should like to support Mr Siekierski’s recommendation and to salute the Commission, represented by Commissioner Dacian Cioloş, for the way he sustained his objections so that this level of aid to the most needy could continue. It would be incomprehensible to European citizens if European solidarity broke down at the precise moment when it is most needed, at the time of the worst crisis Europe has seen for many years. Therefore, despite the reservations of certain Member States, I am convinced that it will be possible to keep this kind of support in the budget and, whether it comes under agriculture or any other area, the important thing is to maintain this aid in the future, for as long as poverty exists in Europe. Hopefully this future will be short, and if it is, it will be because we have been able to end poverty in our European continent.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I really appreciate your support, which helped achieve this result. This just goes to show what we can do between institutions when we work together and I hope we can continue to do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to make two comments. Firstly, on behalf of the Extreme Poverty intergroup which I now chair: I think there is a real issue regarding subsidiarity that we cannot avoid in Europe and that affects each level of decision-making. I respect this principle, and there are some members of my group who have a more stringent and more legal view of subsidiarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some may think that the most deprived should be taken care of by the Member States and at local level. However, all the same, I think it would be a serious mistake to allocate Europe alone the role of bogeyman, the role of an institution imposing austerity and restraint, and to believe that the job of helping the most vulnerable in our society rests solely at local level.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I call on the Commissioner to defend the Europe 2020 strategy. It worries me greatly that, in the European Council’s conclusions, there has been a movement away from the Europe 2020 strategy towards the Euro Plus Pact, where there is no mention of combating exclusion and poverty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, in the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), I also believe that the issue of food deserves to be looked at from the point of view of the common agricultural policy. I do not have the answers today, I have not taken any definitive position. However, there is a social aspect in helping the most deprived and there is also an aspect that, in my opinion, falls to the common agricultural policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What kind of food does the common agricultural policy provide? At what price? For those who may not have the means to fund themselves, is having to resort to charity the right answer or should we have a common agricultural policy that provides food for all? I do believe that that was what the founders of the CAP had in mind.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We will have the chance to talk about it and I am counting on you, Commissioner, to help us have an in-depth debate and above all practical measures for all.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I, too, would like to thank all those involved in bringing about this compromise, who ultimately led to its success. Retaining food aid is indispensible, particularly in times like these. By this point, almost 19 million people are dependent on food aid. It is an act of European solidarity for Europe to provide aid this way. Clearly, we must not restrict our thoughts to these two years. Instead, we must now essentially begin developing the new programme for afterwards. Poverty will not be a thing of the past after this programme and, at the end of the day, we cannot accept simply declaring, at that point, that our work is done.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to work towards this, as we are no longer simply dealing with emptying out surpluses from the European Union’s overfull stores. Instead, we need to move to a regional partnership between farmers and the ‘most deprived food aid’ scheme that ensures that, ultimately, there is aid for those who live in poverty. That can only happen in collaboration with the farmers and the ‘most deprived food aid’ scheme. In the case of Germany, we have ensured that we also include the food banks.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that we continue this kind of food aid, as European aid, even beyond this date. We welcome the fact that countries like Germany have now given up their obstructive attitude and we hope that, in future, countries like Germany will help to come up with a new concept.</p>

I think this is where the Commission needs to consider what it should do in the future.

It is a disgrace that a blocking minority is being masterminded from Germany to prevent food being given to those that go hungry – a disgrace that is also indicative of what the European Union has become: sacrificing solidarity at the altar of ultraliberal and bureaucratic logic.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Should we be resigned to the idea that the European project is now helping to crush the weakest? When it comes to finding billions for the banks, they change the law. Yet, when it comes to the most basic charity to the poor, the legal wrangling begins.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as others have stated in this debate, this programme arose at a time when food mountains and milk lakes were the norm. Thankfully that is now history. It is my opinion that we need to take account of the change in circumstances and recognise that this programme belongs to social policy and not the common agricultural policy. I believe that the move proposed by the Commission in the post-2014 MFF, to move the programme through to social policy and deliver it in that way, is the correct longer-term solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the situation we face today concerning next year’s budget for the programme is unsustainable. I will support the compromise found between the institutions at the vote tomorrow. If we do not accept this temporary deal the risk is clear: money available to charities in 20 Member States will drop from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million next year, leaving over 18 million poor and in need. That cannot be allowed to happen in 21st century Europe, especially at this time of crisis. Therefore I would urge colleagues to support the temporary solution at tomorrow’s vote.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is important to stress that this deal can in no way serve as the foundation for the future of the programme beyond 2013. Tomorrow we are only voting on a transitional solution to unlock the short-term deadlock. It is not a long-term solution. We will have to find a proper, agreed, solid basis for the long-term future of this programme. I reiterate my call for it to be transferred to social policy for future delivery.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I am delighted that the compromise by the Council of Ministers has solved an acute problem. Thanks to the Dutch Government among others, things had almost reached a point where 18 million of the most deprived people in Europe, from one moment to the next, would not have received any further food aid.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, I am still worried. No one seems to be thinking constructively about how we can help food banks to become independent of direct food deliveries from the EU, and I find a great danger in this. Member States are not preparing their food banks for a possible end to aid. Parliament is ignoring the fact that the aid programme can run for another two years only on condition that it stops in 2014. If we let this uncertainty continue, we are back in the same situation as in December, with food banks that have no independence at all and poor people living under the sudden threat of hunger. We want to start working towards independence now. By giving food banks the tools to gather for themselves the food that must otherwise go to waste: lorries, computers, training in logistics, a public brand awareness campaign, the pooling of expertise in the management of food banks without government support.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Now that food aid is assured for the next two years, it is very important to get clear about what happens after that, and I call upon the Commission, the Council and my colleagues to do so as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="fr">‘Blue-card question’ to George Lyon . – I would like some clarification from George Lyon. He appears to be saying that, beyond 2013, the matter would need to come under social policy and therefore, as far as I understand it, it is a matter for Member States as they are responsible for social policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would just like to point out to him that in voting for the six pack and then maybe the two pack, in the current economic situation, it will be impossible for Member States to pursue a social policy because some Commission officials oppose an increase in social spending, because limiting spending is all they know. We are just passing the buck to Member States who will be unable to carry out social policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Siekierski on a good report. Food aid is needed. On the one hand, there is widespread poverty within the European Union. This has been particularly evident during this severe winter – 600 individuals have frozen to death in Member States of the European Union. On the other hand, we might not have a surplus of food, but farmers are constantly experiencing difficulties in marketing it. It follows that this programme ought to operate.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my country, Poland, the programme is operating quite well and it would not be possible to stop it suddenly. Accordingly, it is right to extend it to 2013, though I share the view, expressed on behalf of my political group by Mr Nicholson and others, that this programme should be financed under social policy, and not under agricultural policy, because agricultural policy has other objectives. First and foremost we must protect food production and guarantee food security for Europe. That is what the common agricultural policy should be aimed at, but the programme should be maintained during this transitional period.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the latest Eurostat data for 2010 reveal a drastic situation in terms of poverty and social exclusion: 26.9% of children under 17 and 19.8% of the elderly are at risk of poverty. In total, as has already been said, 115 million people in the European Union are at risk of poverty, which represents almost 24% of the population. Today these numbers are likely to be even higher due to the impact of so- called ‘austerity measures’, with more unemployment, lower wages for workers and reduction in social benefits.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this situation it is even more important to maintain and strengthen the programme for distributing foodstuffs to the most needy, to ensure that those dependent on food aid and the many who will come to rely on it do not suffer from food poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For this reason, we think it is essential that this aid is maintained over the next 2014–2020 financing period, at least under the current conditions, which means through the annual financing of EUR 500 million guaranteed in its entirety by the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objectives of the programme for food distribution include reasonable prices, market stabilisation and support for deprived persons. The institutions and national authorities have confirmed the need for full support of the programme through the EU budget, rejecting proposals for cofinancing by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">There has been discussion about food wastage. We recently approved the report by Mr Caronna, which included the problem of the meagre access of the poorest population groups to food. I think that the issues are closely linked: helping to reduce wastage also means helping the most deprived.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are many local initiatives to help people in financial difficulties. I would like to mention the example of food collections, which should play a more prominent part in the programme on which we have been asked to vote. People who wish to donate spontaneously but do not have channels to do so need to be organised and put online. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who work towards these goals in their everyday lives.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I do not think that I need to present any more arguments supporting the programme for distributing food products to the most deprived persons. Although it comes at the eleventh hour, approval for the financing of this programme means that we are extending a hand to our fellow citizens facing particular problems.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This programme, which has proved its effectiveness for 25 years, symbolises Europe’s solidarity and unity. More than one in thirty Europeans has received food aid in recent years, and I would like to remind you that out of the 40 countries occupying the top places in the global food vulnerability index four are Member States of the European Union. I congratulate the Commission for the efforts it has made to end the current stalemate. I also congratulate the Council for the wisdom and compassion it has shown and, lastly, I congratulate the rapporteur for all his fine work.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, I feel that this is the point when the European Parliament needs to be already starting to think about the future of this programme after 2013. Finding a suitable legal base, along with the Council and Commission, is the first step that we have to take. Are the programme’s costs high? No. We are talking about one euro per year from every one of Europe’s 500 million citizens. The United States invested USD 85 billion last year in the food aid programme, marking a 15% rise on the previous level in 2010. More than 43 million people, more than one in eight Americans, received this aid.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the moment, we are talking more about productivity, growth and innovation. I firmly believe, without any shadow of a doubt, that they are the right solutions for resuming economic growth. However, we do not have the moral right to ignore the poor in Europe. The food aid programme has been operating for a quarter of a century and must continue to provide a safety net for those who need it.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Parliament has often expressed its approval of this programme and also of its continuation after 2013. Our political initiative will therefore continue, we will not rest just with tomorrow’s vote, Mr President.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his strong work on this issue and for acting quickly to ensure that NGOs, charity organisations and European citizens who rely on the deprived persons’ food programme were not left in the lurch for 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I spoke in this Chamber on this issue last year I urged the European leaders to use a little common sense – if not some compassion – in relation to the continuation of this scheme. I am pleased that the scheme has been guaranteed for a further two years. However, the 13 million people who rely on this scheme for food are not going to find an alternative in two years’ time. If anything, the numbers requiring food aid will increase, given the current economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">This scheme must be continued in a format that will ensure that those at risk of food poverty have access to food. I understand that there are those who object on the basis of budget allocation, subsidiarity and a perceived overlap with national competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is all very fine, but 43 million people in the EU are at risk of food poverty. We have a scheme in place that provides food for these people. Why change it because of an ideological objection? For 500 million people it represents value for money in terms of delivering actual results. We must not play politics with a scheme that improves the immediate situation for those who cannot afford to feed themselves or their families.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, more than 43 million Europeans are threatened by food poverty. It is therefore with a certain amount of relief that we welcome the new extension of the European food aid programme until 2014. The poorest will continue to receive the essential charitable support that they need at a time when the demands faced by these charities are growing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yet the real question is what next. What will happen after 2014? Is it not just lip service the promise to reduce poverty by a quarter in the EU by 2020? We must give ourselves the means to achieve this goal. That is why we will ensure that the new financial framework preserves this programme as part of the cohesion policy to ensure that those Member States in need do actually benefit from this aid. However, there is one condition: this transfer to the ESF should also be allocated a large enough budget to ensure that no-one is left by the wayside. What is at stake here is the matter of solidarity between the European people.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One final point, Commissioner, the poorest are also entitled to a healthy and balanced diet. Only a truly sustainable CAP can guarantee that fewer Europeans will need food aid in the future.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the availability of food for everybody is undoubtedly an important thing in any civilised society. I have no difficulty at all with that. My difficulty with this proposal lies in its assumption that creating a EUR 500 million programme centrally is an adequate or efficient response to hunger. I believe that measures of this type should be delivered by individual Member States in ways which are administratively efficient.</p>
      <p sl="en">The continuation of such a programme for 25 years is not evidence of its success, but evidence of the development of the dependence culture that should be broken. By the continuation of this scheme under the guise of solidarity we do nothing to encourage an efficient and productive food industry in Europe. Aid in kind is contentious across the world and I seen no reason why it should go unchallenged here in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, one of the consequences of deepening divisions between the social classes has been an increase in the number of people requiring food aid. Different levels of income and property are normal in a democracy, but social contrasts and glaring discrepancies are not. In my view, our debate should not centre on whether or not this programme should be continued, but on how it should be implemented in practice. This programme should not be perceived as a substitute and a replacement for the role and significance of national aid. It does, however, complement national aid, and is an expression of solidarity and of the realisation of the ideals on which the functioning of the European Union is based. We should strive to reduce the extent of poverty, but it would be fanciful to think that poverty can be totally eliminated. Unfortunately, we are faced with the prospect of major social problems and the European Union cannot and must not abandon this programme. It should also be noted that charitable organisations, disregarding the tardiness of institutions, are already engaging in activities this year, particularly in such difficult conditions as those of the present crisis.</p>

    <intervention id="2-288-000" speaker_id="1929" name="Christa Klaß" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, around 18 million Europeans suffer from food poverty and depend on food aid. That cannot and must not be the case in Europe. The aid programme that we are discussing today grew from the surpluses in the common agricultural policy (CAP) in days long since passed. Mr Siekierski said as much. We have changed the CAP, but hunger has remained.</p>
      <p sl="de">The transitional solution now proposed will ensure supplies only until 2013. The question, then, is what comes next? We need to clarify areas of responsibility. In principle, EU agricultural policy cannot be a source of social security. It is, essentially, the primary responsibility of every state to ensure and to safeguard the elementary provisioning of its own population. However – and I address this point to Mr Tarabella – that does not in any way preclude European solidarity. Support programmes must be implemented at national level, and that is also where the responsibility for such programmes must rest. That way, they are sustainable. The situation of the most deprived must be improved in the long term. Commissioner, you should hold a round table discussion involving the Member States in question and the European Union in order to come up with joint solutions that eliminate the problem of hunger in a targeted way.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other side of the coin, the scale of food wastage is shameful: around 50% ends up being thrown away! We need a new culture of valuing our food. However, we also need information and education in order to re-learn proper housekeeping and the proper handling of food. When a third of all adults can no longer cook it is no wonder that many people are not able to feed themselves with low-priced staples. This is an ethical problem, but it is also an economic and a social one.</p>

      <p sl="fr">For, after all, what are we talking about? We are talking about EUR 500 million that is already in the budget, that could be used and that could have been used differently following a decision of the Court of Justice to fill the purpose that they are being used for today, in other words, relieving the pain of 16 million European citizens who do not eat every day to satisfy their hunger.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Instead, we are having to have this debate. I welcome the Commissioner’s determination to save this budget, because at the end of the day – as Mr Omarjee pointed out – we go around talking about hundreds of billions for the banks yet what a fuss when it comes to EUR 500 million for the very poorest! This is serious.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What signal will Europe be giving out if this programme is not saved beyond 2013? Today, I must commend you, Commissioner, and the rapporteur and all those who helped ensure that it was saved until 2013.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I too applaud the positive outcome of the transitional period, and hope that a definitive solution will be found in the financial programming that will deliver a stable, definitive and rapid response to a real need, which is unfortunately growing, because the number of poor people, the new poor, in Europe is continuing to rise. New areas of the population that were formerly self-sufficient now do not have enough food to live on, and food is a primary basic right. These are poor workers, single mothers with children, and people suffering from invalidating illnesses. The spectre of hunger has once again raised its head in civilised Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that we cannot remain indifferent, just as we cannot support the reasons of those – including many of our colleagues, unfortunately – who think the responsibility should lie first and foremost with the Member States, that we should focus on nutritional education, and so on.</p>
      <p sl="it">In my view we should first of all take this action and then abolish food subsidies, not the other way round. Luckily, however, outside Parliament, Europe is made up of young people, volunteers, associations and political groups that want this House to deliver more fairness and solidarity in Europe.

Today’s debate is a disgrace, and I wish to draw the attention of the agriculturalists to the fact that the agricultural sector is not terribly highly regarded in Europe. In other words, it would greatly improve the prestige and reputation of the agricultural sector if we would not refer to separating the agricultural sector and welfare policy. I wish to draw the attention of Mr Nicholson and Mr Lyon, whom I highly respect, that, as we agriculturalists who are sitting here know well, direct payments include a vast number of social elements in the first pillar. Anyone denying that is lying. It follows that hungry people are not interested in whether they receive their bread and butter in the framework of common agricultural policy or welfare policy, but in whether they receive food to eat or not. I therefore ask the agriculturalists not to make such references, but to protect the poor and the prestige of the agricultural sector.</p>

It is also very important that 100% of the LTL 500 million comes from the European Union budget, and I definitely agree that only products produced in the European Union should be used and those foods that are produced in the European Union, not imported from somewhere else.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Indeed the Council’s desire to reduce the amount of food aid at this difficult time is absolutely incomprehensible, when the number of people requiring aid has really grown as a result of the crisis. I therefore agree that today we have to make savings, both at EU level and in the Member States, but we cannot do this by reducing assistance for the poorest people who have increased in number.</p>
      <p sl="lt">We all agree that during the crisis there certainly has not been a drop in the number of poor people and savings in this area would not solve the problem of the financial crisis.

In fact, it is conditional upon the withdrawal of the Food Aid Programme in 2014, and on the will of the German Chancellor, a will that unfortunately is not upset, that Europe is no longer funding any social policy of this type beyond that date.</p>

      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, I do believe that what we have here is only emergency treatment of the symptoms.

There are very few cases where poverty and need in Europe can be traced back solely to natural disasters. The reality is that they can be traced back to an enormous financial disaster. What we decide here in Europe at this point will perhaps help bring about food distribution. What we need, however, is fair distribution. We need to act much earlier. We need to provide education and we need to provide jobs and incomes. The aim, as Mr Capoulas Santos said, must be that one day we will no longer need this aid.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, poverty is a political, economic and social problem. The Union certainly needs an integrated approach to poverty. The relief provided by the food distribution programme for deprived persons is important but it is not, of course, a solution to the problem. Of course, that does not mean that it should be abolished. Also, deprived persons do not care if the resources come from the CAP or from the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="el">The current economic crisis in Europe will exacerbate survival conditions for a very large section of the population and this must be addressed in a viable and cohesive manner. Combating poverty and exclusion are clearly a matter for the Union. At the same time, we should perhaps remember that the rest of us, who are able to eat our fill, must become more responsible citizens. The 179 kilograms of food wasted per person per year is, I think, an insult to deprived persons and is also a matter that should concern us.</p>

We are committed to this and I hope that in terms of agricultural policy, special efforts will be made so that the poorest can also directly access production.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, together with the many millions of poor people living in the European Union, I should like to let the Commission know how pleased I am that it has reached agreement with the Council that this programme will be continued. It involves not only food for victims of hunger, but also support for agriculture. In Latvia last year more than 185 000 people, that is one in every 12, received this aid. I also agree with those of my fellow Members who are arguing for this programme to continue. As a basis for its continuation, I should like to see us taking food from the intervention stockpiles, and not from the market, that it should be fully paid for from the European Union budget, and that it should all have been produced in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, after several years of the European Council blocking the continuation of food aid to the most deprived persons in the European Union, we have finally reached a situation where we can debate and approve the continuation of this aid in 2012 and 2013. Given that this temporary programme already takes into account the majority of significant changes proposed by the European Parliament, such as the procurement of food in accordance with competition rules, for example, or the use of food sourced primarily from the European Union, we have no reason to prolong this process by submitting additional amendments.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is therefore necessary to comply with the annual limit on the provision of aid from European Union resources, which is set at EUR 500 million, and to try to ensure that food aid is distributed effectively and meaningfully, in order that it reaches those who need it most. Already, however, Commissioner, we have to start working on mechanisms for continuing the programme beyond 2013, because dependent people in Europe will otherwise remain without help after this date.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, contrary to what many people think, the European Union is not an oasis of peace and prosperity. The economic crisis is causing social unrest and has resulted in protests. These protests are often simple calls for help, since there are many people in Europe who truly have no food to put on the table. The frequently quoted fact that 18 million EU residents – including those drawn from groups other than just the unemployed, migrants, the homeless and generally excluded groups – are availing of the food distribution programme, demonstrates how important it is for our people.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We have to remember that 40 million people in the EU are enduring poverty and just as many are at risk of such hardship. I am pleased, therefore, that the agreement between the institutions has been reached and that the assistance programme will be implemented. Those in need are not interested in the legal basis for the programme. This protracted discussion is an embarrassment for the EU institutions.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, access to food and an adequate diet should be the basic right of every citizen. Statistics show that this is not the case. In 2008, 13 million people in 18 Member States made use of food aid, but in 2010 this number had risen to 18 million. The economic crisis and the related decline in jobs have brought greater poverty for more people, who have become dependent on food aid. Going forward, the programme must therefore remain one of the key ways of protecting those who are most in need.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The programme must be effective not only in its accessibility, but also in its speed. We should prevent the mistakes that we have seen in each Member State, for example in Slovakia, my own country, where redistribution takes a long time and is accompanied by misunderstandings, thereby losing the meaningfulness of the aid provided. Therefore, the chain from production to distribution must be organised so that it is as short and as effective as possible.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the rise in basic food prices in recent years has significantly shrunk European citizens’ purchasing power. The economic and financial crisis within the EU has had a considerable impact, automatically increasing the social vulnerability of the EU’s most deprived citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is vital to continue the food distribution programme in the current economic and political climate. It could provide strong support to 18 million Europeans without imposing additional burdens on national budgets. We need a transitional solution as a matter of urgency for the remaining years in the current multiannual financial framework. The proposal was blocked at the Council for two years, and we are pleased that we have finally reached a compromise. I wish to thank the Commission and Commissioner Cioloş for the efforts they have made.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I therefore support the adoption of measures for the EU to resume granting this aid as soon as possible, as well as the proposal tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) to extend the programme during the next multi-annual financial perspective.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, in my homeland we have a saying, which goes ‘help quickly and you help twice as much’. That is happening now, which is a good thing. It also seems to be reasonable to have obtained food from the intervention stocks. There are now problems with that, however. For one thing these stocks are shrinking, and for another surpluses cannot always be used where they are produced. The result is therefore food transported over long distances, costs and also damage to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">It would therefore be a more sensible approach to promote and support small and flexible local structures primarily involved in working with the food aid programmes. Obviously, I do not mean old-style state agricultural combines on the former Communist model, but small, smart structures and concepts that make it possible to help the poor quickly but also to retain the jobs that we need in the agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">I do not believe that poverty can be abolished that quickly. We will, rather, have to deal with greater poverty, and that is why concepts like this absolutely need to be provided for in the medium term.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few things in response to your comments.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The food aid programme for the most deprived persons was borne of a two-fold objective of the common agricultural policy. On the one hand, the CAP seeks to ensure that farmers have a constant and fair income, which is why we have the market intervention mechanism, and on the other hand, it seeks to ensure that all European Union citizens have access to food. As a result, rather than destroying the surplus intervention stocks on the market, they were made available to the most deprived persons.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Since then the common agricultural policy has evolved, as have the instruments within it. For that reason, the European Commission is proposing maintaining this programme, because even if we no longer have the public stocks, some EU citizens still have difficulty getting access to food and that problem has yet to be solved. The Commission therefore wants to continue this programme in the context of the European social policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is not true to say that there is no European social policy; I would remind you that we have a European Social Fund. That does not mean that the European Union and the Commission are alone in implementing social policies in Europe. That is the responsibility of the Member States but it does not prevent us from having a social policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in response to those who say that there is no future for this programme after 2013, I say that the European Commission has proposed maintaining this budget in the framework of the social policy. That budget proposal is now being examined in the Council and in Parliament, which will take a decision on it. On the basis of that decision on the future of the budget, the European Commission will of course fulfil its right and duty to initiate legislation, including in this area. That is the answer that I can give you.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Naturally, even if the programme of aid for the most deprived becomes part of the social policy, that would not prevent us from looking at the issues of food waste and nutrition. The Commission is considering this and will present its ideas to Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, I would also like to respond to Mr Agnew, who made a comment about the Commission. I can assure you, Mr Agnew, that the Commission has never asked farmers to produce less, but to produce better. I think that that is an intelligent solution, not a stupid one, as you described it. That is the direction of all of the proposals that we have put forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also want to say to Mr Stoyanov that if Bulgaria does not participate in the scheme to aid the most deprived, it is because that is what its government has decided. We cannot force the Member States to take part in the programme, but those who want to take part can do so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I would like to thank you for your support for this programme and I welcome the fact that, with this decision, we can now ensure that this programme continues, at least for the next two years.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it was heart-warming to hear in this House such immense support for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union. I am certain that we are all happy with this outcome. Words of gratitude are due, in particular, to the European Commission, for its determination in working towards ensuring that the programme is fully functioning. The Commission recommended a number of adaptations and improvements for the programme.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should remember that it was the legal basis, and not the principle of or the necessity for food distribution to the most deprived, which was contested before the Court of Justice. The Court challenged the legal basis only. It is true that those in need are not interested in legal bases, however Parliament must make decisions about these legal bases, and we need to discuss them in this House. As the Commissioner said, the programme is available to countries that express their interest and intention to participate in the programme. Currently, limited intervention in the agricultural market, low food stock levels and proposed changes in the provisions of the common agricultural policy (CAP) over the period 2014–2020, will require the development of a new legal basis. I am convinced that on the initiative of this House we will accomplish this objective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are aware of the need for the food distribution programme to be implemented in a way that is more efficient and brings improved results. In addition, it is a good idea to analyse the relevant experience of other Member States. We should ask food distribution organisations as well as social and consumer bodies about better and more effective ways of managing this programme in the future. Further close cooperation with the governments of the Member States is necessary. Finally, it is our wish for Europe and for the world as a whole that the number of people requiring free food remains at a minimum. We should therefore aim to grow the economy and reduce unemployment. Lastly, I would like to thank all those who contributed to saving this programme. Ladies and gentlemen, let us keep up the good work for the future.</p>

We see 80 million European citizens in a situation of poverty and around 45 million at risk of malnutrition. Fortunately, after difficult negotiations, there is now support for continuing the food aid programme for the neediest in 2012 and 2013. However, it was scandalous the way in which seven countries initially prevented this at a meeting of Ministers for Agriculture. Austerity measures, which hardly exist in countries assisted by the troika, inevitably affect these populations, and this has clearly been a political choice, reinforced by a discourse which maintains that sacrifices for all are inevitable. On the other hand, the EU, which was quick to support the banks with thousands of millions of dollars, cannot be so hard-hearted as to refuse the EUR 500 million of essential support for the Food Aid Programme, especially in this difficult period when it is needed more than ever. Europe has contradictions which need to be resolved, for the sake of this project and for the sake of European citizens, particularly the poorest. A Europe of solidarity must strive for greater equality.</p>

We must now make every effort to safeguard this programme beyond 2014 in the negotiations over the long-term budget.

By prioritising the most deprived at this juncture, we can set a standard to be followed even when this crisis is overcome, and which will be adopted automatically during any time of difficulty in the future. Furthermore, as an agricultural union, Europe has the benefit of a great deal of quality foodstuffs, and while programmes for the distribution of these goods have existed for some years now, to the Commission’s credit, they should be developed and expanded upon in the months and years ahead.</p>

There is a contradiction between this position of certain Member States and my report on poverty, in which Parliament calls for the programme to be continued after 2014 and states that the austerity measures must not undermine social protection.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European programme for deprived persons has helped achieve social policy objectives, in addition to fulfilling the agricultural aspect of the common agricultural policy. The programme has proved to be an important means for supporting certain groups of people affected by poverty, especially against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis. This programme provides a tool that the European Union can use to offer direct assistance to those in need in the more than 20 Member States, thereby showing that the principle of European solidarity works.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome that this programme will continue this year because, in Romania alone in 2011, NGOs provided assistance to more than 2.8 million people on very low incomes. However, in my view, it is paramount that this aid also continues in the future. I think that the EU needs to provide support to deprived persons at a comparable level to this year, in the knowledge that the common agricultural policy also has social elements. After all, people in need have still to be given assistance. Based on the principle of European solidarity, the Member States which oppose this measure must prove that they understand the situation of the groups suffering poverty and agree to continue the programme under the necessary conditions, which is also proof of EU-level solidarity.</p>

At the same time, it will be based on European agricultural produce, which will help support the EU’s domestic production.

It is important that the programme is also continued beyond 2013. Unfortunately, I am quite certain that we will not have succeeded in eradicating poverty by that time.

Statistical data suggests that over 18 million persons across the EU avail themselves of this programme on an annual basis. The food that reaches the most deprived households provides significant support to the families living in these households. In the face of the ongoing crisis, the number of poor and socially excluded people is constantly increasing, and for that reason, I think that it is essential for this document to be adopted as soon as possible. Food aid is very important and should be continued, however, in my opinion, many of those who avail themselves of this support would prefer to be employed. Apart from food support, our actions should also focus on job creation, aimed at reducing the number of poor and homeless people.</p>

Although the blocking minority in the Council gave in at the end of 2011, allowing the programme to be extended for two years, we sincerely hope that a solution can be found to enable a similar European contribution to be maintained after 2013. We are therefore determined to find an alternative to financing the MDP programme from the budget for the common agricultural policy.

As a matter of fact this aid, which provides food-aid for 13 million people across the EU, is losing its capacity because on the one hand, the reframed CAP has increased dependency on market purchase while on the other, the current economic crisis has considerably aggravated poverty. If food aid is only a short-term form of assistance in the struggle against poverty in Europe, we need to insist on its importance being maintained and enhanced. The rise in inequities among EU citizens is a threat to the EU, and access to food must be one of our priorities as it concerns fundamental rights and human dignity.

I am glad that after two years of blocking, the Council has decided to move forward, and I therefore wholeheartedly support the rapporteur’s position that the second reading in Parliament should be completed as soon as possible. On the positive side, it should be emphasised that the Commission and the Council have agreed to a 100% level of financing, and have also set the total amount of aid at EUR 500 million. It is worth pointing out – and the Council has also drawn attention to this – that the system of food distribution should be improved, and it must be ensured that assistance truly reaches those who need it. Unfortunately there have been cases in Member States in which food aid is indeed distributed free of charge, but this is only done in larger centres, and it can be obtained by all who desire it. In rural areas, therefore, aid unfortunately does not reach those who need it most. The Council position emphasises that food aid should be distributed to those who have been designated as deprived persons as defined by the local or national government. Here the role of local social workers should definitely be increased, as they are best aware of who needs assistance and how to ensure that they receive it. One important point that I would like to emphasise is that I wholeheartedly support the distribution of food originating from the EU, which is also supported in the Council’s positions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am very pleased that we were able to reach agreement on the dairy package with the Council and Commission in December. In this regard I must thank my shadow rapporteurs for all the very hard work that they put in. We started off with – I think I can safely say – some very divergent views and positions, so it is a testament to their commitment that we found solutions to our differences and ways to incorporate each other’s point of view.</p>
      <p sl="en">I must also thank the Council and the Commission, who at all stages of the process adopted a very constructive approach towards Parliament. This cooperation was what allowed us to achieve a deal at the end of the day. I was determined to get a deal on the dairy package agreed before we entered into the CAP reform and I am very pleased that we have achieved that. I would also just like to pay my own special thanks to those involved in the Polish Presidency for their hard work through the weeks and the months that we were working on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">The dairy package was, to a large extent, a dry run for Parliament’s engagement in the CAP reform. It definitely gave us some insight as to how the process will evolve. Although of course the reform will be on a much larger scale, we must bear this in mind, and I think we all gained some valuable experience in terms of how we should go about finding our internal position within Parliament and also how best to negotiate with the other institutions. It is my belief that, in order for Parliament to influence the reform of the CAP to the maximum effect, we should learn from our experiences in working with this dossier.</p>
      <p sl="en">So what does the dairy package contain and how will it impact on our milk producers? That is the question which everyone is, of course, very keen to know the answer to. From the outset I would say that this legislation will not solve all the problems of Europe’s dairy sector, but I do hope that the measures contained within it will primarily help to strengthen the bargaining power of dairy farmers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The establishment of the EU-recognised producer organisations and the interbranch organisations for the sector is a step forward. Producer organisations will be able to negotiate milk volumes of up to 33 % of the national production. This is, I believe, a good balance between boosting their negotiating power and protecting against distorting competition. Producer organisations should help farmers to organise themselves better and strengthen their position in the supply chain, especially in Member States where a system of cooperatives is limited or non-existent.</p>
      <p sl="en">The package also includes provisions for EU contracts to be implemented at Member State level. Some countries may choose to go down this route while others will not. This is likely to depend on the characteristics and the situation of each individual country’s dairy market, whether they are a co-op system or export-driven. The decision to impose contracts will be voluntary, which will give Member States the flexibility to choose what suits them best. If a Member State decides to impose contracts, those contracts must respect the conditions laid down by the regulation. These include the condition that the price, the volume of milk to be delivered and the duration of the contract are outlined in the contract.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the main points Parliament has achieved is in the article which allows for the regulation of milk supply for production or for PDO and PGI cheeses. We worked hard on this to achieve a balance between supporting quality production and making sure that we did not interfere with competition law or the functioning of the internal market. I am sure that my southern counterparts will have more to say on this issue and will outline how it will particularly help milk producers in their countries, which are those Member States which have high levels of quality production.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to conclude by saying that I think we have ended up with a package of measures which are flexible. Although milk is produced in every EU Member State, each country has very different needs. There are Member States that would like to see quotas being retained past 2015, while others look forward to increasing production. However, no matter what the focus of the industry, we have a responsibility to ensure dairy farmers have the opportunity to achieve the best possible price for their milk. In this regard, I would urge producers to look carefully at the measures and take full advantage.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We managed to reconcile the different approaches adopted at the start through an open discussion among the three institutions and a shared sense of the responsibilities involved, which did not lose sight of the actual aim of the exercise, which was to give the milk sector new instruments to ensure its sustainability and strengthen producer organisations in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘milk package’ is one of the most important legislative acts in the agricultural sector currently being adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure established by the Treaty of Lisbon.

      <p sl="fr">The ‘milk package’, as Mr Nicholson said, gives Member States the option of imposing the use of milk delivery contracts between producers and processors. This proposal also allows milk producers who so wish to organise themselves into producer organisations in order to consolidate their position in the food chain, notably through the collective negotiation of milk delivery contracts, which is clearly reinforced in the proposal. They may also be able to benefit from the option given to Member States to require milk purchasers to offer milk producers a contract with a minimum duration of six months. The final text also reflects the desire to take into account the specific nature of cooperatives, which was expressed by the high-level groups consisting of Member State experts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘milk package’ highlights the role that can be played by interbranch organisations that bring together around one table producers, manufacturers, traders as well as consumers with a view to improving the transparency of the milk supply chain and the mutual understanding of the role of each link in the chain. In another measure to improve transparency, the ‘milk package’ establishes the necessary framework for monitoring milk deliveries after the milk quota scheme expires by stipulating that the relevant data must be supplied in good time, thereby allowing the Commission to provide milk producers and actors operating in the milk sector with timely information on the market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The ‘milk package’ will also play an important role in regulating the supply of quality cheese with protected geographical indications, which brings benefits in terms of added value and sustainability for vulnerable regions in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will end by pointing out that two dates have been set to assess the application of the provisions introduced by the ‘milk package’: the first for the end of June 2014 and the second for the end of December 2018.</p>
      <p sl="fr">By each of these dates, the Commission will present to Parliament and to the Council reports on the development of the market situation in the milk sector. The effects on producers in disadvantaged regions will be assessed in particular in relation to the general objective of maintaining production in those regions. We will also examine potential incentives to encourage farmers to enter into joint production agreements.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, we have reached the end of our work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, we agree with some of the points you just made. There is one word, however, that I wish to highlight: the word ‘quickly’. I do not think that we can agree on that. It was in February three years ago that the milk crisis erupted or reached its peak. That is how long it has taken us to reach a compromise allowing us to offer milk producers new prospects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the spirit in which we worked and congratulate our rapporteur, who, for this first, because it was a first for us to legislate together, enabled us to work in a spirit of genuine dialogue and with a shared desire to build something.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are therefore offering producers a new capacity, that of derogating from competition law and organising themselves into stronger units. However, Commissioner, we all know only too well that this is just one stage, just one step, and that we have not yet found the real solution and the real tools to move beyond the era of milk quotas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">An exit phase should be prepared. That phase has not yet been designed. We have to continue to work on that aspect. As you said, we have not yet completely resolved the issue of vulnerable regions either. Even if we are offering them a tool, with the possibility of organising themselves better with the geographical protection mechanisms, we are still not enabling them to keep milk in those regions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is absolutely essential for the report that you are going to submit to us in 2014 to set out solutions that allow us to maintain this activity in vulnerable regions, where grass is often the only production and where milk is often the only way of making a living. Without it, all of the work and all of the hopes that we have put in this text will be in vain for many farmers.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, James Nicholson, in particular on his working method, which ensured that all of the shadow rapporteurs were involved throughout the procedure, which is not often the case.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Following often arduous negotiations, the Council and Parliament produced an agreement that, if not the most exciting, at least seeks to organise the milk sector. The decision to do away with the quotas by 2015 made a reform of the sector essential in order to avoid other milk crises, such as the one experienced throughout Europe in 2009, which has just been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Like others, I naturally regret the decision to do away with quotas because this system of regulation – even if it is not perfect and has never been perfect – has on the whole worked well for 25 years, avoiding any major crises, and perhaps it only needed to be a bit more flexible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, this new regulation is going to give milk producer organisations the option of collectively negotiating contract clauses and, in particular, prices. We have given them the tools they need to boost their position in the supply chain, derogating from competition law, and that was by no means a foregone conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the Member States that opt to impose contracts in their territory will be able to set a minimum duration of six months, and six months is not bad compared to what the industry is currently doing, sometimes changing the price from month to month.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as the contracts are concerned, I would of course have liked them to be compulsory throughout Europe. That was not possible because it was opposed by a majority in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should also highlight the positive move to recognise interbranch organisations, even if it is unfortunate that, as the fourth actor at the table, we did not include the public authorities, which should act as arbiter, like the Observatory on prices and margins, for example.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, although this agreement is a step in the right direction, it could be improved by giving the public authorities back their role as regulator. We will see this again when examining the single CMO.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to us as representatives, who put a great deal of work into this text, I would also like to pay tribute – and this is obviously a bit out of the ordinary – to Mr Baragiola, an EP official, sitting behind me here, who took part in all of our meetings and played a vital role. It is only right that we thank the officials, who work for this public institution. I did not want to miss this opportunity to do so.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Nicholson for his successful handling of the negotiations. We have decided on the abolition of the existing cost-intensive and market-distorting milk quota system and analysed the findings of the high level group for milk.</p>
      <p sl="de">The dairy package that has resulted from the negotiations is an important first step towards a market and competition-oriented dairy sector. The formation of inter-branch organisations is being promoted, with these organisations to be given the ability to negotiate contracts on behalf of their members. The negotiating power of milk producers is to be bolstered – in future they will be able to negotiate on an equal footing, if they so wish.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also good that we will not be overshooting the mark. These contracts will not be permitted to make up more than 33% of the national and 3.5% of the European market. This ensures that there will be no new imbalance and that the necessary market freedom is retained. As there is no general requirement for contracts, farmers’ individual commercial freedom to make decisions remains secure. This is an important element of a functional market.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support the dairy package, and I ask you all to vote in favour of this package in tomorrow’s vote in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that the target has been missed, much as the approach taken was the right one. In contrast to the view expressed by Ms Reimers, I do not believe that the result here is a stronger position for producers. Producers are to be permitted to group together in up to 3.5% of the European market. Yet we already have dairies on the European market that make up over 6% of the total volume of milk. Is that fair? For me, the answer is a clear no. That would require higher collective volumes for the dairy farmers. We do have the contracts, and I agree that they are a good option. Yet we have left them as voluntary because a majority of the Member States did not want these contracts. This will make no difference on the market. There is hardly any mention of prices in connection with the contracts. At the end of the day, this will make no significant difference at all for many milk producers.</p>
      <p sl="de">We had proposed that some consideration should be given to what will actually happen once the milk quotas have gone. We had proposed discussing a monitoring body in which the producers, the dairies, but ultimately also the European Union, consider quantity adjustment on the markets. Essentially, that too was strongly watered down.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would agree that the milk crisis is behind us. I am fairly sure, however, that the next milk crisis lies ahead of us. We have strongly rising producer numbers, and we have falling prices. What will we do when the next milk crisis comes along? Will we once again use taxpayers’ money to pay export subsidies in order to remove volume from the European market? That cannot be a solution. We therefore call on the Commission to bring forward its report not due until 2014 to an earlier date and to bring to the table proposals for real solutions for the post-quota period. We need to discuss this.</p>
      <p sl="de">I get the impression that many Member States are thinking of their dairy industries, but not their milk producers. This situation must change. With this package, we are not providing Europe’s milk producers with any really good tools or future prospects. Our group will therefore be voting against this package.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is with a degree of sadness that I am speaking about the situation in the milk sector. Going back many years, I recall my home village, with hundreds of cows grazing on the meadows. These days, there are none. In many parts of my country, dairy farming has all but disappeared, and this is also the case in many other European Union Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We, however, must do our job. We must prepare as best as we can for the abolition of milk quotas. We will certainly not be able to avoid crisis situations, of which we have already seen signs. However, Mr Nicholson’s proposal is a step in the right direction. The regulation of contractual relations is very important. Dairy farmers represent the weakest link, and their position needs to be strengthened vis-à-vis dairy processors, and it is in this direction that the proposal contained in Mr Nicholson’s report is heading. This proposal should be supported.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal for a regulation does not resolve the fundamental problems in the dairy sector. It is a further step down the path of excusing the unacceptable and disastrous decision to abolish milk quotas in 2015 and that alone makes it already unacceptable. The rest is a fantasy that those preparing to approve this proposal have been selling to milk producers, whose situation is deteriorating by the day. It is fantasy that it is possible to guarantee producers fair prices in the free and deregulated market that they advocate. It is fantasy that the right of every country to produce as much as it needs can be guaranteed without instruments for regulating production. It is complete fantasy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This path will boost the power of big business; of the major retailers and processing companies. It will further concentrate production with a few producers and countries, destroying it in other countries, where many producers will be ruined. It will continue to facilitate dumping between Member States and the flooding of national markets with imported milk. It will continue to promote intensive, export-orientated production that jeopardises food security and quality and environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For all these reasons, what is actually needed is to reconsider reviewing the abolition of dairy quotas and their adaptation to the needs of each country and to the relative level of development of its productive capacity. It is important to have market regulation and intervention instruments that guarantee producers fair prices, taking production costs and retail prices into consideration, so that value added is distributed fairly along the sector’s value chain.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly I want to thank the rapporteur, my colleague from Northern Ireland, Jim Nicholson, for all of his efforts in getting this report to this stage.</p>
      <p sl="en">While we all recognise the issues raised by the high-level group and by this report, the elephant in the room remains, namely the question how farmers are to receive a fairer share of the profit within the supply chain, especially from retailers. Prior to the elections in 2010, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom pledged to put in place a supermarket ombudsman. They have now been the lead party in our coalition government for almost two years and we still have no arbiter for fairness in this food supply chain in place. We need real, tangible progress on this now and such an ombudsman must have the teeth and power to deal with the unfairness within the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report deals with the power farmers have in the supply chain, but I would raise concerns about the level of responsibility given to the Commission and the role of interbranch organisations. I feel that such organisations may well add another layer to the supply chain. Northern Ireland has a unique milk trading system and a cooperative structure, but also trades a large amount of milk with another Member State. Any organisation which would have jurisdiction in two Member States must not affect the current structure or disturb the balance in trading relations. Member States should be given the flexibility to decide what is best, in their own interests and in the interests of their producers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Commissioner, the direction is the right one, but the impact in the Member States will vary enormously. In Germany, this dairy package will have hardly any impact. We already have producer associations under our Market Structure Act. Many farmers in Germany are organised into cooperatives, which means that they already jointly market their milk and dairy products. Contractual dealings in Germany are regulated by statute. In the private sector, we even already have these supply contracts.</p>
      <p sl="de">Unfortunately, this dairy package will not enable us to solve fundamental problems. This dairy package regulates dealings between producers and dairies. The biggest problem that I see, however, is in the relationship between the dairies and the retailers. This is not some kind of accusation against the parties involved. Nor, as landowners, are we responsible for this, but I ask you, Commissioner, to use your influence in the Commission to ensure that we regulate further issues on the basis of this dairy package, for example the issue of terms of payment for dairy products. It is not acceptable for farmers to deliver products to dairies – fresh milk expires after three days – and for the chain stores to only pay up after 60 or 80 days. Regulation is needed here.</p>
      <p sl="de">A second point is the listing fees, the discounts, that have to be granted here. We need binding net-net prices in the dairy sector so that transparency prevails in the sector. The supply volume rules are not binding, the length of contract with fixed prices between dairies and retail must be regulated. There is thus still much to do. However, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), will certainly be voting in favour of this dairy package with a large majority.</p>

However, it leaves us a long way off the instruments that the sector needs in order to prosper in the coming years within a European agricultural framework where value is, as we would like, fairly distributed in the food chain, rather than a form of agriculture transformed into large-scale intensive farms concentrated in a few Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">While improving the self-regulation conditions in the relationships between sectoral stakeholders is desirable, thinking that this in itself is sufficient is a serious mistake that could drive thousands of milk producers, dozens of regions and even some countries out of dairy production. The debate on regulating the dairy sector with a view to an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable sector throughout the EU still needs to take place. Furthermore, we will not be able to abandon the milk quota scheme without ensuring effective instruments for managing supply.</p>

I just hope we make the same speed when it comes to negotiating the CAP as he has managed to achieve during the milk package.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the dairy package as a significant step forward in bringing greater transparency to the EU milk market; it makes it possible for dairy farmers to come together and have greater strength in the market place. Legislation provides for fair and open contracts and I hope they will help to eradicate some of the abuses in the dairy market. But as Jim himself pointed out, this is no silver bullet to solving some of the problems that there are in the market place.</p>
      <p sl="en">Producers need to come together to use these powers if they are going to extract a better return. In the United Kingdom the coalition government has called on the dairy industry and the farmers’ representatives to agree a voluntary code of conduct and I welcome that initiative. However, the Minister should make it crystal clear to the dairy trade that, should they refuse to sign up to a voluntary solution, he will wield the big stick and use the contract powers in this legislation to compel them to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">One area I am still concerned about is the role of the retailers who are not covered by this legislative package.

We do not believe that this package goes far enough. There are some points to like, and there are others to be rather less enthusiastic about, because this is urgent.</p>

Perhaps we should come up with a better package than the one we have before us today.</p>
      <p sl="en">That said, there clearly is a majority for this package. I am glad to welcome some elements of it.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the heart of the problem is the lack of balance between milk producers and milk processors. Unfortunately theirs is a subordinate relationship and, let us be honest, milk processors are exploiting milk producers. We have seen clear examples of just how far they will go in a price competition and what additives they will add to certain dairy products in order to be able to sell them at low prices. Using additives and then distributing their products through multinational chain stores throughout Europe they generate a price competition that will sooner or later result in us having to import even our milk from China, which will ruin European milk producers. It is therefore extremely important for us to urge milk processors to exercise self-restraint through the regulatory system as well. The solution and the keyword here is food sovereignty. Only through food sovereignty can we ensure that people have access to dairy products at low prices and that these products are of a high quality throughout Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">The issues I want to raise today are wider than just the report that is before us – which I will be supporting – and relate to the report of December 2010 which spoke of the soft landing for the dairy sector. That report indicated that a soft landing may be not guaranteed in a number of Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I rise on behalf of one of those Member States – Ireland – which has a problem in relation to this much promised soft landing. Dairy farmers in Ireland see a situation where their product is in demand, where Europe is below quota and where they would wish to be able to produce without a penalty. I know the position from the Commission on this issue, but I would ask – like other colleagues – that perhaps we need to bring a report forward from the 2014 date.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to consider the position of those Member States which are not enjoying a soft landing and where there are penalties being imposed on producers for supplying a product for which there is a market. The penalty is extremely severe, whereas Europe is actually not filling its entire quota over all of the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="it">The work and commitment of the European Parliament and our rapporteur Mr Nicholson, whom I must truly thank for his enormous commitment along with the shadow rapporteurs of this important report, have meant we have reached a rapid agreement on a text that improves the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="it">An important new provision is the possibility of managing and planning the volumes of certified quality dairy products.

      <p sl="ga">Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur Jim Nicholson for the great work he has done on this report.</p>
      <p sl="ga">The crisis in the dairy sector in 2009 highlighted the severe vulnerability of this sector and clearly demonstrated that it is essential that a degree of stability and certainty is established for dairy farmers when quotas are abolished in 2015.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Just as my colleague Ms McGuinness has already said about Ireland, as we progress towards the abolition of quotas a very worrying situation is developing for dairy farmers, and the threat of a superlevy is present year on year. The Commission has conceded that, in Member States where milk deliveries exceed quotas, a soft landing may not be guaranteed. The milk quota for Ireland and the threat of a superlevy are hampering growth opportunities for the Irish agricultural sector. Overall milk production in the European Union is 6% under the quota, and it is an unsustainable situation that while Irish dairy farmers can meet the EU quota overall, due to inflexibility they will be penalised and the potential for growth held back.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Agriculture is currently one of the strongest sectors in Ireland, helping us out of our current economic problems, yet its potential is constrained with a one-size-fits-all policy that is not working for dairy farmers. It is clear, therefore, that there is no widespread political will to revisit the Health Check decisions, yet I would urge the Commission to consider measures to ensure a soft landing for all Member States and to consider introducing a degree of flexibility into the system for dairy farmers.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the European milk production sector has recently gone through a relatively difficult period, but this has also been the case for other sectors of the European economy. We are all well aware that, from 2008 almost up to the present day, there has alternately been either an economic or a debt crisis, which has inevitably had an impact on demand for milk and milk products.</p>
      <p sl="cs">As recent years have shown, even the European system of quota regulation in the milk sector has failed to head off the negative impacts of the crisis, and it is therefore time to abandon this obsolete system from the age of centralised planning definitively. Milk does not need any quotas in the EU, any more than buns, bread, cars or other commodities need them.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The transition to a quota-free market system should be as smooth as possible, and I therefore support the idea of Member States having the option of regulating contractual relationships in this sector as they see fit, but it must be done in accordance with the principles of the single European market. I therefore back the report by Mr Nicholson, as I believe it marks a step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this debate had gone on for almost an hour before we heard the two magical words ‘soft landing’. They are not to be found either in the Commission’s text or in the text of the agreement. However, I would like to remind the Commissioner of the following: at the time of the reforms in 2007 and 2009, when we voted definitively for an end to the milk quota and for greater market orientation, it was said that all Member States must have the opportunity to prepare themselves for the new situation, in other words to adapt gradually to the new system. Now we observe that, as soon as you opt for greater market orientation, you allow the market to play a bigger part, power is unequally divided when it comes to the food production chain.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This agreement is an attempt to strengthen the position of the primary producer, and to that extent it deserves to be welcomed by you. It does contain good elements, for which I congratulate the negotiators. But I also have my doubts about it. It concentrates on the relationship between farmers and processors, whereas the problems now often occur at a later stage in the production chain, with supermarket buyers and supermarkets themselves. That is where the big money is made; that is where, for a number of years, you have seen supermarkets make a profit of EUR 0.20 on a kilogram of young cheese and then a profit of EUR 1.20, six times as much, on the identical kilogram of young cheese two years later. Therefore, for the how-manyeth time, we are asking the European Commission: please have some concern for transparency in the food production chain, since it is a matter of where the power lies and how the profits are shared.</p>
      <p sl="nl">To conclude: this agreement is a good means by which certain Member States can prepare themselves for the new situation. I am thinking of mountainous regions, other disadvantaged regions, Member States with highly protected raw produce. But other countries will remain shackled to the milk quota system right up to the last moment and then have to pass over from the old to the new system from one day to the next. This is hardly the promised ‘soft landing’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As Mr Dantin has said, it is a step forward, but, looking to the new situation that awaits us in 2015, we must make other steps forward too, and I hope the European Commission will do so without delay.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The decision taken under the French Presidency to do away with quotas risked leaving milk producers without any safeguards in the case of market disturbances. We therefore welcome the ‘milk package’ proposal as a first step in the right direction. It was necessary to strengthen producers’ negotiating power in relation to the private processing industry by encouraging them to group together and promoting the use of contracts, which are only used for half of all production.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My Socialist colleagues, especially Stéphane Le Foll, helped to improve the proposal by ensuring the future of milk production in vulnerable regions where cheeses with protected designations are made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is still a great deal to do, however. In particular, it will be essential to shift the balance back towards livestock farming and provide other market tools in order to prevent any further crises in the milk sector. We must take the opportunity presented by the CAP reform to supplement this mechanism so as to guarantee farmers’ income and once again put them back where they belong at the heart of the food supply chain and food safety in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, Europe’s dairy sector will experience a major shift following the expiry of dairy quotas, which may upset the balance between farmers and dairy processing companies in terms of bargaining power. This may also lead to unfair commercial practices when setting farm-gate prices. Such a process would be of particular harm to small producers, especially in countries where there are many small farms.</p>
      <p sl="lt">It is precisely for that reason that the European Union should support cooperation between farmers and their organisation into producer associations and cooperatives. This would strengthen their bargaining power in future. Supporting cooperation is particularly relevant in Lithuania and those countries where farmer cooperation has not received adequate support. We will thus protect farmers from unfair competition in the dairy sector. I would like to thank Mr Nicholson for excellent negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I support the compromise reached in the trialogue, which is aimed at strengthening the negotiating position of dairy farmers in relation to the processing industry, much as I am aware that it does not solve all the problems that dairy farmers currently face in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Even 50 years ago, Commission President Sicco Mansholt envisaged preferential measures for the creation of producer communities within the framework of the common agricultural policy. In my country of Luxembourg, too, the dairy sector is the main pillar of our agricultural sector as a result of the high proportion of grassland. Our agricultural sector and our farmers long since understood that the best solution is to come together to form a cooperative that takes over the processing of the milk itself.</p>
      <p sl="de">It was for exactly this reason that, in the Council, five Member States voted against the compromise, which does not live up to the requirement of being a soft-landing instrument. The Commission has the right of initiative when it comes to proposing legislation, and I would therefore like to call on it to put a legislative proposal to the Council and Parliament this year in order to remedy this clear and costly fault in the system.</p>
      <p sl="de">A linear reduction up until 2015 in the super levy which is imposed on each litre of milk that exceeds the quota, or the abolition of the fat correction mechanism, could at least reduce the negative effects of the regulation, which is being phased out without detrimental impact on those Member States that are not affected. This dairy package is also the final report of the high level group that was to bring about a soft landing after the phasing out of milk quotas.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is astonishing that there is absolutely no mention of milk quotas in this report. Young and ambitious farmers in Luxembourg and four other Member States who are attempting to prepare for the deregulation of the milk market and aiming to expand their production in order to be able to keep up on the global market after 2015 can only do so by buying additional quotas now, even this close to the abolition of the milk quota system. This is an unnecessary and enormous additional capital cost which puts them at a disadvantage in comparison with farmers in the other 22 Member States.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the Regulation we are debating today is not perfect. It alone cannot resolve the difficulties of a sector that has structural problems and also, because of the economic context we are living in today, problems relating to the current situation. Although it is not perfect, however, this Regulation is a decisive step forwards in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="es">The thing is that, even though we all realised some time ago that no market is perfect, we also realised there was a great need to include as many regulations and measures as we could to protect our farmers in this area. All this also impacts on people’s food security.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also realised there was a great need for us to allow compulsory contracts for a minimum duration and a maximum amount, at least as a defence mechanism, because our farmers obviously cannot negotiate on the same footing as distributors, middlemen or collectors.</p>
      <p sl="es">There is still much to be done. We will have to improve the security networks and make them quicker to react and more effective. We will have to work decisively to ensure that the sector is better coordinated within the value chain, verify that quotas are not being improperly distributed, especially in certain areas, and promote the quality policy.</p>
      <p sl="es">With our positive vote, however, and everything that is still to be done, there is no doubt that many dairy farmers will today be able to see that Parliament has defended their most basic labour right – to be able to live in dignity on the earnings from their work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs. What we have before us is sound and necessary legislation. The aim of this legislation is to re-define and re-regulate the supply chain. For the first part of the chain – namely from the farmers to the processors – it will also succeed in doing so. It strikes me that what this legislation fails to tackle – and a few other Members have already said this – is the second part of the chain. What happens between the processor and the consumer? There are quite a number of unanswered questions in this regard. Some of these, such as cost-price selling, have been mentioned already, but there are many others, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why this package cannot represent a final answer to the abolition of milk quotas. In exactly the areas where the abolition of the milk quotas is difficult, which is to say in mountainous and disadvantaged areas, production is already organised into cooperatives, and little is likely to change.</p>
      <p sl="de">What is positive and sensible in this legislation is the option for producer organisations and associations to apply special rules and supply management in relation to the protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI). There are many organisations that need this, and in the wake of the debate about the quality package, this is the right approach to take. We should also implement this for other products in the quality package. In the end, what is right for milk can only be fair for other products.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, milk production is probably the most important sector within the entire common agricultural policy (CAP). The lion’s share of the CAP’s funds is spent on milk producers and dairy processing. For this reason, we should place strong focus on enabling the milk sector to develop further in a sustainable manner. Over the last number of years, we have accomplished a great deal, and these achievements have benefited not only agricultural producers but also consumers. To an extent, the solutions that are being proposed today meet the expectations of farmers and also of consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would very much like our future work to focus more on the development of cooperatives, however, and on structuring the milk sector on this management approach.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their work. The milk package that we will be deciding on tomorrow, after prolonged negotiations, is something that I welcome in principle.</p>
      <p sl="de">The aim is to strengthen farmers’ position in the value chain. Parliament acknowledges that farmers’ negotiating position in the milk market is too weak in comparison with the chain stores. Meanwhile even the consumers are aware that it is not the farmers who profit from any high food prices. The producer price, after all, is only a fraction of the retail price.</p>
      <p sl="de">What we are deciding on tomorrow will neither improve the situation for milk producers nor provide a lasting solution for the highly sensitive milk market. Similarly, there is no way – and this idea was just mentioned – that it constitutes a soft landing.</p>
      <p sl="de">The introduction of dedicated producer communities is something that each Member State must evaluate for itself. There is already a producer-dominated system in the form of the cooperatives. For many Member States it therefore makes more sense to continue to develop the cooperatives. Dairy farmers must be able to raise their market position to an equal footing. In mountainous regions, in particular, that will be the key issue. Many dairy farms in such regions specialise in high-quality production. That high quality needs to be worth it, however, and that is why the protection of European high-quality products is the primary objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is important that the Member States should now also adopt these instruments. Doing so offers added benefit and promotes competitiveness, especially for the worst-affected rural areas. This milk package is a first step to supporting the stricken dairy sector. It does not, however, provide any real ways to solve the problem of the abolition of the milk quotas.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is an urgent need for further measures to deal with this absolutely free market situation and the volatile prices. Instruments are needed that provide a solution for dairy farmers in all the Member States, that emphasise the value of the milk produced and that ensure a livelihood for farmers.

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the milk and milk products sector has recently undergone significant changes, which were deepened by the financial and economic crisis. The high prices of inputs and the current decline in demand for milk products have led to reduced revenues for direct producers, but this has not been reflected in reduced prices for end consumers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The insufficiently transparent functioning of the supply chain therefore has many inconsistencies that may indicate the existence of unfair trade practices at the expense of producers, but also at the expense of households at the end of this chain.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore believe that, in creating prices, the milk products sector should reflect basic market signals, particularly those of supply and demand, consolidation of competition, and clarification of the fundamental rights and obligations of each actor; an improvement in awareness and responsibility should also lead to a fairer allocation of total revenues in the chain, and an improved, reasonable standard of living for dairy farmers.</p>

First of all, the European Union is preparing for a future common agricultural policy, starting in 2014. This future policy must feature solutions for dairy farmers.

      <p sl="pl">At this point, however, I would like to say that in practice, apparently superior solutions very often turn out to be inferior to the solutions already in place. It was not the quota system which caused the 2009 crisis. Milk quotas are a tested instrument offering guarantees and security to producers. In other areas, such as in banking, we are proposing greater supervision and regulation, while in the milk sector we are moving towards liberalisation.

In this context I would like to call to the attention of the Commission and Parliament the fact that in these countries more emphasis could perhaps be placed on the creation of producer organisations, because here producers are often in a bargaining position of complete vulnerability vis-à-vis buyers.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me to make a few comments following the debate on this proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some of you pointed out that the milk quotas have been eliminated and that we should keep them. I would remind you that the 2009 milk crisis happened when we still had quotas. That shows that the existing quota system is no longer a solution in the current market conditions. That is why the Council decided in 2008 to put an end to that system. Therefore, the Commission no longer has anything to do with it. It is a Council Regulation that has ratified the decision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am very well aware that this milk package may not resolve all of the problems in the milk sector, but we wanted to act as quickly as possible. Mr Dantin said that he did not agree with me about the word ‘quickly’. I feel, however, that we have acted quickly given that the High Level Group presented its conclusions in spring 2010. The Commission presented its legislative proposals, after its entire internal procedure in autumn, at the end of 2010. We are now at the start of 2012 and, following a codecision procedure, are about to reach the end of the process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In this ‘milk package’, the Commission has proposed, and I have undertaken to present a progress report in 2014, analysing again the situation in the milk sector and market before the milk quotas end in 2015, and determining, on the basis of that report and analysis of the market situation, whether any additional proposals need to be presented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some of you highlighted the problem of cooperatives. As Mr Nicholson said, cooperatives receive special treatment because the aspects of the proposal that do not directly concern them are not applied to them. Cooperatives per se are a solution that individual producers did not have because in that context the producers were themselves also responsible for processing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards what is known as a soft landing, in other words the phasing-out of milk quotas, some of you again stated that the Commission was not pulling its weight and that it did not want to present any other proposals. However, it is always the farmers, and even some of you, who say that a certain degree of stability is necessary sometimes to be able to plan, to some extent, for the medium term. When it comes to the soft landing, gradual increases in the quotas until they are stopped in 2015, the Council took a decision in 2008. There is thus no reason now for the Commission to seek to overturn, just a few years later, a decision taken by the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the transparency of the food chain and the negotiating relationships between producers, processors and retailers, I would remind you that the Commission has set up a forum on the food supply chain, which is currently examining all of these issues. The Commission has decided not to submit any legislative proposals before listening to the actors in the food chain and before allowing the actors to talk to one another and submit proposals, so as not to regulate further when the problems can be resolved in other ways. At the last meeting of this food chain forum, the Commission stated clearly that in June of this year it would take stock of the work done by the forum and, in particular, the proposals submitted by the actors in the food chain. On that basis, the Commission will appear before Parliament and before the Council with a report and, if necessary, proposals in that area.</p>

      <p sl="en">Can I also deal with one other point and that is the ‘soft landing’ part raised by Mairead McGuinness and Esther De Lange. I had two amendments – one from each of them – that I kept to the very last moment, and I can assure them that if I could have done anything about it I would. However, it was not within the realms of the possible. One of the difficulties when you make a piece of legislation is that you cannot put everything into legislation, and that is something this House has got to get used to as we go into the reform package.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I leave you with one particular appeal: we have set out here the rules for the producer and for the processer, but the elephant in the room is not here and we have no law over him and that is the retailer. Until we deal in this House with the retailer there will be problems not just for milk but for other areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I also leave with this appeal to the producers and to the processers: to work together, to cooperate and give strength between you. Then I believe there will be a good future for the dairy sector throughout the whole of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In relation to the decision of the Council of the European Union regarding the abolition of milk quotas, I would like to stress my position on the need to maintain the milk quota system after 2015. This instrument has already fulfilled its role in the past, by stabilising supply and demand in the milk market and at the same time guaranteeing sales for producers operating in the market. An annual increase of national milk quotas would, consequently, help prepare the sector for the abolition of restrictions in the area of milk production. In this context, Poland is already prepared for such a situation, both in terms of organisation as well as production potential.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On the basis of the experience in 2008, however, concerns remain as to the possibility of another collapse in demand in the milk market and related lack of sales of surplus product. Moreover, I would like to remind you that the deadline for the abolition of milk quotas has already been changed in the past, for many different reasons. Consequently, taking into consideration the situation of farmers and the desire to provide them with a guarantee of work in a stable environment, it is my hope that more and more countries will support my position on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The draft regulation on contractual relationships in the milk and milk products sector responds to the complex situation in the milk market, fluctuating prices and unfair negotiating practices in relation to the price of milk purchased from farmers. In order to ensure sustainable development of milk production and to guarantee producers an adequate living, it is vital to take steps at Union level to ensure a fairer distribution of profits within the supply chain. Agriculture is the most strategic sector in the EU generally, and it is absolutely essential to look for and identify support options. If our farmers cannot make a decent living, they will cease agricultural activities and we will all be dependent on supplies of food from the outside world. In view of the future global food shortages that would be a huge risk, which the EU must not take. We are proposing that milk producers come together in large units and cooperatives. I would like to point out that we have been successfully dismantling such large farming enterprises in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe over the past 20 years. Small-scale independent farmers were presented as the successful model of the West. I do not believe that any minimum contractual commitments between milk producers and dairies will help to resolve the situation. We should consider setting minimum purchase prices for raw milk throughout the EU, particularly for the winter and summer periods. We must not shrink from this bold step forwards!</p>

      <p sl="en">I supported this report, which strengthens the bargaining power of dairy farmers by allowing farmers to negotiate collectively their contract terms with dairies, including the price. This report also allows us to outline once again the dire need for a soft landing for dairy farmers ahead of the lifting of milk quotas in 2015. I am calling for a flexible approach to the quotas and the application of pan-EU quotas. In the last two years Ireland narrowly avoided the imposition of fines. The last thing we want to do is fine progressive dairy farmers who are planning for expansion, growth and investment post-2015. The EU as a whole was 5 % under quota in 2011; punishing productive countries simply does not make sense at a time when the EU has a milk deficit of 7 %.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The milk crisis of 2008–2009, which brought producers to the brink of poverty, must not be allowed to repeat itself. Based on the data of the Hungarian Dairy Products Council, two years ago milk that was sold in Hungarian shops at HUF 109 a carton had been bought up at HUF 9 per litre. The report also addresses the issue of preventing producer organisations from obtaining monopoly positions both at national and European level. Fixing buying-in prices for half-year periods will help eliminate the price fluctuations afflicting producers. This is a vital step to take before the 2015 abolition of the milk quota system. I find it unfortunate that the Commission and Council did not consent to making contractual relations mandatory. Despite the fact that Hungary boasts 1 million hectares of pastureland its milk sector still lacks competitiveness due to the climate conditions of the Carpathian Basin. Due to the prevailing rainfall patterns, milk can be produced far more cost-effectively in Poland, Slovakia or Germany, and the regulation of contractual relations would therefore be essential for Hungarian producers. High feed prices and the increased taxes, labour costs and contributions that are a result of the measures introduced by the Fidesz Government make it impossible to make an honest living at current commercial ‘delivery price levels’. The Hungarian people should once again be convinced of the necessity of standing united. Cooperative societies are not the devil’s work; they have a decades-long history in several Western European countries. They are a means for producers to protect their interests in relation to the processing industry and supermarkets. I am hopeful that the Hungarian Government will undertake voluntarily the commitments required by EU law.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU–Morocco agreement encourages both sides of the Mediterranean to concentrate on capital-intensive corporate farms at the expense of family and peasant farming. The rise in the number of quotas at reduced rates for a wide range of fruit and vegetables makes it difficult for EU producers to continue to compete, but at the same time does not help the development of balanced agriculture in Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Labour costs are the principal factor determining the price of fruit and vegetables. Morocco has an undeniable advantage today due to the widespread use of child labour and the ban on agricultural workers forming trade unions. Workers in Morocco earn around EUR 5 per day, compared with EUR 50 in Spain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">How can we cope with this type of competition and this social dumping? Respect for trade union rights and a ban on child labour are essential preconditions for ratification of a new trade agreement with Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The circumventing of the system for import entry prices is a cause for concern among EU producer organisations. The problems with the system allow operators to reduce the import duties they pay. The European Commission has never equipped itself with the means to combat this type of fraud and it needs to resolve this issue before proposing a new agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In Morocco the way in which export quotas are managed favours large groups. In the tomato sector 70% of Moroccan exports come from just three groups. Moroccan family-run farms do not benefit from this agreement. According to a study funded by the European Union, the Abu Dhabi Tiris Euro Arab investment fund obtained 700 000 hectares in the south of Morocco to plant and harvest citrus fruits, olives and market-garden crops. The monopolising of land, which is so shocking to our fellow citizens, is also happening on a large scale in Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the Souss region, where tomato growing is concentrated, the water table is falling by two metres per year. In Western Sahara agri-businesses are drawing on coastal ground water. This irrigation results in the salinisation of fresh water, jeopardising the local population’s drinking water supply. Exporting 350 000 tonnes of tomatoes is equivalent to exporting 35 million cubic metres of water from Morocco to Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The social, environmental and economic effects have not been assessed by the Commission. We are still waiting for the impact study. A study is required to allow Parliament to reach a decision in full knowledge of the facts. We have never allowed an agreement to be adopted before identifying its social, economic and environmental repercussions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have raised the question of the territorial scope of the EU–Morocco agreement. A number of countries, including the United States, have signed free trade agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco that expressly excluded Western Sahara. This was done so as not to influence the outcome of international negotiations being held under the aegis of the United Nations to enable the various parties to find a peaceful settlement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As the Commission and Parliament’s Legal Service hold diverging views on this issue, we cannot guarantee, ladies and gentlemen, that this free trade agreement will comply with the international treaties that are binding on the European Union and all of its Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, the European Parliament should reject the agreement. That will enable us to reopen the negotiations on a new footing. I think that it will also send a strong message to the Commission to change its working method by allowing the European Parliament to participate from the initial stages of the discussions among the parties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission must produce concrete, serious impact studies on the economic, social, environmental and budgetary effects of the agreements it is negotiating. We can no longer accept the fact that Parliament only has the option of saying yes or no.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must inform you that, contrary to the opinion adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which opposes the agreement, the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade is to approve the agreement between the European Union and Morocco. I am bound to state that publicly.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the arguments that I have just set out, you will no doubt realise that I am asking you very clearly to vote against the conclusion of this agreement. This is not just in the interests of European farmers, who are unanimously opposed to the agreement right across the trade union spectrum, but also, and above all, it is in the interests of Moroccan farmers, who are today being deprived of their land by large exporter groups and who, because of this unbalanced agreement, are going to have their meat, dairy and cereal production capacity destroyed by imports by large European groups.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to reject this agreement, which is a bad agreement. By rejecting it, we will reopen the debate but we will not prevent the previous agreement from continuing. It is thus simply the extension of the agreement that I am asking you to reject, in the interests of farmers on both sides of the Mediterranean.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in an evolving southern neighbourhood, Morocco has remained a key partner of the European Union and, in line with rapid changes taking place in the region, Morocco is undertaking substantial political and economic reforms. As you know, a new Constitution was approved in July. Free and fair elections took place in November, and now the new government is taking the reform agenda forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">Major efforts are being made towards the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, as well as towards sustainable and inclusive development. They deserve our full support, not only because this is in our strategic and economic interest, but also because we have committed ourselves to it. You will remember that last spring both the Council and the European Parliament agreed to be much more responsive to the efforts of our partners. We must now all work together to ensure delivery on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the key features we can offer Morocco in the long term is progressive and deep economic integration with the EU internal market. In the mean time, we need to look at trade measures that can be introduced rapidly and that can be beneficial for both sides. This is what we can offer Morocco today, with the agricultural liberalisation agreement which is the subject of today’s debate and the vote soon to take place.</p>
      <p sl="en">The entry into force of this agreement would represent a significant step forward for overall bilateral relations between the EU and Morocco. It would demonstrate that the European Union is indeed delivering on its promise to support economic development in the region through increased trade opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Needless to say, our southern partners have not forgotten that our renewed approach towards the Southern Neighbourhood includes increased market access, and they will hold us to our word. But we should not forget that this agreement is also in our own interest. That is why it was approved unanimously by the Council. Morocco will make extensive moves to open its markets to EU products and this agreement will immediately liberalise 45% of EU exports, increasing over time to 70%. It will provide new opportunities for EU exporters.</p>
      <p sl="en">This agreement is the result of sustained dialogue and combined efforts. Concessions have been made on both sides, and any blockage at this stage could have serious consequences for our relations with Morocco, in particular with regard to the continuation of ongoing negotiations on the liberalisation of services and on a mobility partnership.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the same way, the adoption this morning of the recommendation by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck on the protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement covering the general principles for Morocco’s participation in EU programmes marks an important new stage in our bilateral relations. It gives Morocco the right to take part in a range of current and future Community programmes. This is very much to be welcomed.</p>
      <p sl="en">By also giving your consent to the trade agreement tomorrow, this Parliament will serve to underline that the EU stands by its firm commitments. It will show that we support southern Mediterranean partners’ ambitions for reform, and that we demonstrate that support in very practical and concrete ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is the time for the EU to act. This is the time for us to show that we mean business, but also that we stand by our word to Northern Africa and to the process taking place there right now.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I would like to thank you for your contribution to the debate throughout the consultation period on this agreement, which is extremely important for our bilateral relations with Morocco. I also welcome this significant step forward in the Treaty of Lisbon, which allows us to hold an in-depth, open and transparent democratic debate on an issue as fundamental as a trade agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will begin with a few general comments on the substance that I feel are important and then I will answer some of the specific questions that you have raised recently about this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Morocco is not just a partner like all the others. It is an important partner on a political and economic level, but also on a human level. It is a country that has had an advanced status since 2008 in relation to the European Union. Morocco has demonstrated its desire to forge close ties with the European Union and has undertaken to continue in that direction, in particular by aligning its agricultural policies with the Community acquis .</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the political context of the Arab Spring, we want to deepen our partnership even further in order to reinforce the democratic momentum through greater political and economic support, including in the field of agriculture. The trade agreement with Morocco forms part of the European Union’s responsibilities and its commitment to promote the development of Moroccan agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is very clear that we wish to support Morocco’s Green Plan, which offers targeted incentives for small Moroccan farms and local operators. They are a key link in terms of the security and stability of the food supply chain and the country’s economic and social development. This is a very important aspect, in my opinion, and I can assure you that I am monitoring it personally.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we look more specifically at the agreement, I feel that it is an important marker of Morocco’s advanced status, a marker negotiated with great care over a number of years. This agreement, which I strongly urge you to support, is a balanced agreement on the whole and it opens up trade prospects for our farming sector. The internal balance of the agricultural negotiations is an essential element, in my mind, not only for this agreement with Morocco but also for future agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I understand that there may be concerns about it. I think that we have managed to alleviate those concerns in recent weeks and I want to mention a couple of specific points.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As far as fruit and vegetables are concerned, I can assure you that they were dealt with in a very sensitive manner when the agreement was being negotiated. It contains all of the provisions needed to safeguard the future of European production, including tomatoes, courgettes, cucumbers, garlic, clementines and strawberries. These products will not be liberalised by the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Equal attention was paid to the health aspects. Consumer safety is not negotiable and Morocco takes this matter very seriously, as demonstrated by the latest inspections by the European Union’s Food and Veterinary Office, carried out as recently as February. The Commission also provides technical assistance to improve Morocco’s administrative capacities, including in this area. The agreement will strengthen the channels of bilateral cooperation, the safeguard clauses and the provisions on the sanitary and phytosanitary rules and standards of the European Union. Clear provisions on these aspects are included in the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Rest assured that the European Commission will monitor strictly the volumes imported, especially for the most sensitive products, as well as the quality and safety of the products. This agreement will also enshrine Morocco’s undertaking to open negotiations on a bilateral agreement on geographical indications. You are all aware of how important that aspect is for the European Union. That commitment is a step towards a quality policy, which I strongly champion, as you know.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I have heard recurring concerns about the functioning of the entry price mechanism for the fruit and vegetable sector. In that regard, I would remind you that in the reform of the common agricultural policy we have now made provision for aligning the entry price mechanism with the Customs Code rules, and that will undoubtedly improve the functioning of this entry price system, which some of you had requested. I promise to move this matter forward as soon as possible. Indeed, the proposal is already being examined by the Council and Parliament in the context of the reform.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This Parliament is going to adopt a strong resolution to accompany this vote. I can assure you that the European Commission will come back to you with a precise follow-up to all of the issues that you have raised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, I call on you to support this agreement with Morocco, which is an important partner on both a political and an economic level to the south of the Mediterranean.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bové’s comments sum up the whole issue. I am here in my capacity as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which passed a majority vote against this trade agreement. Your explanations today have certainly calmed our fears, Commissioner, but when the Committee analysed the agreement the assumptions were very different.</p>
      <p sl="it">Our main concern regards two main factors. The first is that it certainly does not help small-scale Moroccan farmers. The second, which concerns us more closely, particularly the Spanish and southern Italian farmers – especially in Sicily – is the fact that we are dealing with unfair competition, which could completely destroy our fruit and vegetable industry. This is quite honestly very frightening.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do not want this agreement to lean towards helping or promoting multinationals with manufacturing operations in Morocco effectively using slaves or underpaid farm workers. This would certainly not be to the advantage of the small farm workers that the European Union should be defending, nor would it benefit the human rights that colour so much of our debate here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco is a trade agreement with considerable political significance.</p>
      <p sl="it">Morocco is the only country in the Mediterranean area to have made improvements to its constitution, and the recent elections showed that all the political powers are willing to listen to each other. Therefore for us Europeans the Kingdom of Morocco is a stable situation and a doorway to the continent of Africa – a continent which, in addition to the problems we are all too familiar with, is also under too much pressure from the market and Chinese expansion, which should be a concern to those talking about slavery.</p>
      <p sl="it">This agreement replaces its predecessor – which was appalling, Mr Bové, despite the fact that you refer to it, because it did not allow Europe to carry out the necessary controls – and also shows Europe’s new focus on the Mediterranean area, which aims to ensure that democratic processes go deeper and that economic recovery in those countries can combat the current, forced emigration of so many young people.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must continue to strengthen and make relations more cooperative between the EU and the Maghreb, our natural neighbour and economic partner. Therefore approving the agreement marks another decisive step for European politics, which has become more sensitive and aware of the needs of the Euro-Mediterranean area. We understand the concerns of some agricultural sectors but we are convinced that the Commission will find suitable support mechanisms in case of need.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to emphasise that some tools, such as entry costs for sensitive products, already exist as a measure to safeguard some of our specific products. I would like to suggest that when reviewing the common agricultural policy, the Commission take into account in the agreement any objective difficulties concerning the areas involved that might emerge from the impact assessments.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Morocco is ranked 130th on the human development index. It is far behind Libya, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Tunisia. It is a country whose per capita income is half that of Turkey, Libya, Tunisia; in short, it is a poor country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a poor country and it is a country that, in the context of the Arab Spring, did not defend itself too badly. I, personally, would have liked the democratic reforms in Morocco to go much further, but I must say that those that have been put in place are not just for show and the election results have been faithfully honoured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Now, if we say no to this agreement, whose pitfalls have been criticised, are we going to help Moroccans to cope with the political and economic crisis on their doorstep? I do not think so. I really do not think so.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that the question is not whether we are going to be inundated with Moroccan tomatoes, the question is whether saying no will allow us to give hope to those people who are now becoming immigrants, not by choice but as a means of survival.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Do we trust Morocco or not? I say that we should trust Morocco and see what political and economic reforms it is capable of achieving. Mr Bové, we cannot just say no; an overhaul of the economic and industrial policy is needed and we cannot achieve that unless we trust one another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I say that we should put our faith in Morocco and that we should remain vigilant, with regard to both Morocco and everything that the Commission has promised us today, especially the measures to support small farmers and operators, which are not large multinationals.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are numerous advantages to the agreement between the European Union and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products, fish and fishery products.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has just been shown, it will result in 70% liberalisation for European exporters, compared with 1% at present, and 55% liberalisation for Moroccan exporters. The elimination of tariffs will result in an annual gain of EUR 100 million for European exporters. Through this agreement we are going to show our support for the programme of democratic reforms launched in Morocco, with its new constitution, which is fully in line with the ‘more for more’ principle in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Given that 40% of the Moroccan people work in the agricultural sector, the agreement will help to reduce poverty and promote peace and prosperity in the southern Mediterranean in the wake of the Arab Spring.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If we really want to help our neighbours through the current crisis, we should of course be prepared to make concessions, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have also expressed concerns about the agreement in a motion for a resolution that calls for the continuation of the efforts in Morocco to promote democracy and development.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In order to offer guarantees to European farmers, such as the effective establishment of the entry price system and quota limits for sensitive Moroccan products, we obviously need to ensure better application of the conventions of the International Labour Organisation and the equivalent measures between the European Union and Morocco concerning the environment and water management, as well as phytosanitary rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as shadow rapporteur I invite you to vote in favour of this agreement in order to maintain the European Union’s credibility in Morocco and send a clear sign of support for the reform efforts of the Moroccan Government.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as rapporteur for the opinion for the Committee on Fisheries, I actually should have spoken earlier.</p>
      <p sl="es">I wrote that opinion. I suggested in the opinion that we should follow Mr Bové’s opinion and therefore reject the agreement. However, when we voted, the Committee on Fisheries failed to approve my recommendation by two votes. It approved a vote in favour of the agreement, and that is why I had to remove my name from the opinion.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think and hope that some Members who voted against on that occasion – and I am looking at Mr Mato – will tomorrow do otherwise. This would be very welcome, let me say again, for many of the reasons given by Mr Bové, which I should like to echo and summarise.</p>
      <p sl="es">The first and fundamental one: we have worked hard politically, but also legally, to ensure that this agreement explicitly excludes the territories of Western Sahara. Other agreements, for example the one with the United States, already do this, so this would not be inventing anything new. It is possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">For this reason alone, this means we already have an underlying problem if we support this agreement. Beyond this, however, and I repeat, this is not the only reason, we believe that this agreement should be renegotiated to reflect sustainable economic and social development needs, in order to promote regional integration.</p>
      <p sl="es">We also call on the Commission to adopt a strategy that takes into account the challenges of the Arab Spring. We believe that this is also fundamental. The agreement should also, however, promote regional integration and help to strengthen the democratic political sphere. I am not sure that it does.</p>
      <p sl="es">It should also focus on protecting the environment, resources, decent pay for farmers and sustainable jobs. It is not clear that it does this, either.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a general political principle we believe that ENPI aid alone is not enough to stabilise the southern Mediterranean and that economic growth – to provide the kind of jobs for young Moroccans which will mean that they will stay in their countries and be employed and have prosperity in their own country – can come through foreign direct investment and tariff-free or reduced-tariff access to our markets for Moroccan exporters, including for agricultural and fisheries products. This is a vice-versa process. We hope that our finished goods, processed goods from the EU in these sectors, will be exported back to Morocco. So this agreement is a good one; the cake gets bigger for everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">This does not mean that we do not support self-determination for the Sahrawi people through a referendum, as agreed by the UN resolutions, and we are reassured by the Commission that this will not be the case, and that the Western Sahara question has got nothing to do with what is basically a trade agreement between Morocco and the EU.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, my group is going to follow the advice of the rapporteur, Mr Bové, because as you know perfectly well, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission and the Council, this agreement is going to benefit European multinationals and the very few large land owners in Morocco, which include the Moroccan Royal Family.</p>
      <p sl="es">This agreement will be a veritable tsunami for small and medium-scale farming production, both here and there. Yet, despite the Arab Spring, you are also still failing to consider something that should be a fundamental aspect in trade, which is the democratic and social quality of products. You do not take this into account.</p>
      <p sl="es">Morocco is given as an example. What a great example! Some 22% of the electorate took part in the last elections, and the street demonstrations are still going on now. People are still on the streets, but you see nothing and hear nothing, because the only ones you want to reward are the European food multinationals, which are bringing small and medium-sized farms to their knees in the Mediterranean – and in Europe in general – as well as small and medium-sized land owners in Morocco, of which there are in any case very few, and of course Western Sahara.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission and the Council, are you going to infringe international law again? Do you not care? Do you not care that you are including a region that does not belong to Morocco?</p>
      <p sl="es">It does not matter to you. Ladies and gentlemen, please have a little more dignity and more respect for international law.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Bové’s report illustrates well the disastrous consequences that this agreement would have if it is approved. This agreement, which would extend the quotas for certain fruit and vegetable products, makes absolutely no sense if the figures are not respected.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should remember that the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants complained to Parliament’s Committee on Petitions about the mass influx of tomatoes that flooded through Perpignan, priced below the level set in the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">Illegal situations such as this put European farmers at a competitive disadvantage. We should also note that our farmers have to abide by rigorous quality, environmental and social standards that our Moroccan partners do not always comply with.</p>
      <p sl="es">To finish, I will like to raise the issue of the Sahara. The Charter of the United Nations describes the Sahara as an autonomous region, saying that any exploitation of its resources should specifically benefit the local population. In addition, the United Nations does not recognise the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over this region.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union must make sure it complies with international law. I am in favour of an agreement with Morocco, in favour of an agreement in which the European Union establishes rigorous mechanisms to control quotas and prices, an anti-dumping agreement, which will not exploit Moroccan farmers and, above all, will allow European farmers to make a decent living. It is clear that the current agreement does not do this.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its opinion, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development – and we have heard this already – voted against the trade agreement between the European Union and Morocco. In my opinion, we had reasons for doing so that are very much worthy of consideration. The effects of opening up the European market – above all when it comes to agriculture – have not been investigated exhaustively. There must not be competitive disadvantages for either side. What we expect is that imports from Morocco must also comply with European standards. This means the working conditions, social standards, anti-dumping provisions, food security and the standards covering protection of the environment, health and plant life.</p>
      <p sl="de">We expect the Commission to monitor and also enforce the schedules and the tariff quotas. Moreover, it is essential that the rights of minorities in Morocco must be protected in accordance with European standards. All areas of the agreement need to be negotiated with the consent, and for the benefit, of the entire population there – and I am including the Western Sahara when I say that. I am unflinching in advocating that the principle of the protection of minorities should be part of every agreement the EU enters into.</p>
      <p sl="de">Despite this concern – or indeed because of it – it is also important that the EU should be a strong partner for Morocco in its development. A stable democracy is inseparable from a strong economy and a corresponding living standard for the population. For that reason, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I will be voting in favour of the agreement tomorrow.</p>
      <p sl="de">The ‘no’ vote by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was a signal to Morocco, but also to the European negotiators, to be open and transparent and not allow imbalances to develop. At this point I would like to emphasise that those of my fellow Members, including those in my group, who intend to vote against the agreement tomorrow have my full respect.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I also welcome this agreement. Occasionally in politics you have to not just talk the talk, but walk the walk. The European Parliament was rightly – during and following the Arab Spring – strongly in favour of the democratic transitions that were taking place and strongly in favour of taking measures to encourage economic stability in North Africa. This is our first chance to deliver on those promises.</p>
      <p sl="en">Trade – and I serve on the Committee on International Trade – is not an end in itself, but is a tool to promote economic stability and to reduce poverty. This agreement is an opportunity to deliver on our promises to Morocco and to the wider Southern Mediterranean region. I believe it is not only a good deal for Morocco, but a good deal for the European Union and our producers. The protection of geographical indicators is vital for European Union interests and producers. The fact that sanitary and phytosanitary standards will be the same for European producers and Moroccan producers as a result of this agreement means that all producers will now be competing on a level playing field. This should serve to reassure European consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, I understand the concerns of our Southern colleagues. But I believe that the Commission will live up to the assurances that it has given on ensuring that the maintenance of minimum prices and the application of quotas are monitored. Of course, if the Commission fails to carry out proper and due monitoring, we will come back to this Chamber and hold them to account for that. But with the proper monitoring and the safeguards that are in place, this is a deal that can work for Europe and a deal that helps to cement a fruitful relationship with our Moroccan partners.</p>

At the same time, trade agreements of this kind do, in principle, benefit development in the country in question. I am one of those who believe that open trade, in this case with Morocco for example, is in principle a good thing that will steer development in the right direction.</p>
      <p sl="sv">It is regrettable that, during the negotiations held in Parliament, we have removed the earlier reference to the fact that Parliament voted against the fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco in December. It was a difficult debate that ended with the majority in Parliament being critical. We all know why that was.</p>
      <p sl="sv">This demonstrates once again that we are clearly unable to discuss difficult issues with our friends. It has been said here many times that Morocco is a friend of the EU and that is certainly the case: we are friendly with the Moroccans. However, we should be able to discuss difficult issues with our friends too, but certain people seem to think that this is not possible, which is a shame.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, this is a debate in which Parliament must send out a clear political signal.</p>
      <p sl="es">This signal must be a dual one. Firstly, Parliament must champion agreements that promote socially, economically and environmentally sustainable farming models. Secondly, it must insist on compliance with international law and respect for the human and collective rights of the Sahrawi people.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreement favours an export model that is harmful to small farmers both in southern Europe and in Morocco. It only benefits large companies and investment funds, which can bypass European social and environmental regulations.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agreement does not contain a single clause regarding the social dimension, employment or the environment. It speculates with food and encourages unfair competition. It completely overlooks small farmers, both European and Moroccan, and does not guarantee their right to produce, meaning they will end up as cheap labour for the multinationals, who are the real beneficiaries of this agreement. Lastly, according to international legislation, we are up against a problem that is an unresolved political legacy of decolonisation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of course we are in favour of the democratisation of Morocco. Of course we support the demands of the Arab Spring. However, this cannot be used as a way of pressuring us into voting for an agreement that does not even state that Western Sahara is to be excluded from its scope.</p>
      <p sl="es">The territory of Western Sahara, its natural resources and its raw materials belong to the Sahrawi people. Neither Morocco nor the European Union has a legitimate right to negotiate about them. While fresh tomatoes are planted on and exported from their occupied land and fresh fish are caught in and exported from their seas, the children of the Sahara eat canned fish and tomato purée.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is why we must not vote in favour of an agreement that further consolidates this unjust situation. The Commission, the Council and Parliament must make a resounding political statement backing the Sahrawi people’s right to self-determination, in order to end the marginalisation of the men and women of the Sahara and their collective rights as a people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the European Union is the largest importer of fish products in the world. Taking into account the fact that these products are an important source of food, we should pay particular attention to international agreements that generate competition for domestic products. The common fisheries policy (CFP) is enormously important for the environment, the replenishment of resources and the fisheries industry. A sustainable development approach results in a lack of competitiveness in relation to products from non-EU countries. The negotiations should therefore focus on the protection of EU interests in the context of restrictions resulting from the implemented policy, and on the adoption of and adherence to the EU rules by third countries cooperating with the European Union. We should remember that ill-considered trade liberalisation destroys the indigenous market, and consequently leads to uncontrolled increase in product prices in an environment devoid of competition.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, throughout the discussions on the EU-Morocco agreement which liberalises trade in agricultural and fisheries products, the Commission has repeatedly described this as a win-win deal. Can we be a little bit more precise here and say that it is a win-win deal for major European agri-business, for a few Moroccan conglomerates, and particularly for the King of Morocco who owns 12 000 hectares of the most fertile land and who will benefit most from this deal? It is a lose-lose deal for ordinary small farmers, for agricultural workers and fishermen in Morocco and in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am in favour of trade that provides development economically and socially and contributes to a rise in living standards, but in order for that to happen, the rights of working people, of small farmers and fishermen need to be protected. That does not happen in Morocco. The most basic trade union rights are not respected in Morocco: the right to form a trade union and the right to take strike action. Agricultural workers have been dismissed in recent years for trying to form an organisation, and the result is an extremely low level of wages and a race to the bottom in workers’ wages and conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">On top of that is the fact that Morocco is an occupying power in Western Sahara, and this agreement will increase the profits of those who benefit from that occupation.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reality, in answer to David Martin, is that there has been a substantial increase in agricultural production of 2 800% in the past few years: 60 000 tonnes of agricultural produce last year were exported from Western Sahara. This is owned not by ordinary people in Western Sahara but primarily by the King – as a recent report demonstrates – and by major multinationals. Its produce is export-oriented and goes to Europe. The people of Western Sahara have not been asked, they will not benefit from it. The agreement should be rejected.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the feelings of hundreds of thousands of farmers in many regions in Spain can be summed up in a simple but resounding word: ‘no’.</p>
      <p sl="es">We say ‘no’ to an unbalanced agreement; ‘no’ to an agreement without even a single guarantee that customs duties will be paid or fraud prevented; ‘no’ to an agreement that allows unfair competition against our farmers, inducing them to abandon their crops. In short, we say ‘no’ to the disappearance of fruit and vegetable farmers in regions such as Andalusia, Murcia and the Canary Islands.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our ‘no’ should not come as any surprise. It is a consistent ‘no’, just like our consistent ‘yes’ to the fishing agreement. We have not changed tack. We are defending today what we defended last July in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. We voted against then, and we will vote against once more on Thursday, because nothing has changed.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, we do not want anyone to see this as a ‘no’ against the Kingdom of Morocco, which is a preferential partner, and should continue to be one in the future. While Morocco may benefit from the European Commission’s inability to amend the regulation on entry prices, it is not responsible for it.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will finish by saying that our ‘no’ today is also a ‘yes’. It is a clear ‘yes’ to our farmers; a ‘yes’ to reciprocity and strict respect for agreements; a ‘yes’ to good relations between the European Union and third countries; a ‘yes’ to being able to continue farming; and lastly a ‘yes’ to differences being defined by quality, not by fraud.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Mato Adrover, I see things in a fundamentally different way. This agreement cannot be compared with the fisheries agreement. In the case of the fisheries agreement, it was not clear where the money paid by the European Union would be going. In this case we have clear rules about who benefits from the money – and the beneficiaries really are Moroccan producers – as well as about European investments into Morocco. With that being the case, the situation is completely different.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also completely clear that, with this agreement, we are not legitimising the situation in Western Sahara. On the contrary, we are saying clearly that a solution needs to be found in the interests of the people. We are also making that clear with our resolution.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot, however, send out a signal to the Arab Spring that we will always seal off our markets per se. We do need to offer solutions for fair trade so that there really can be change through trade. It also means that, if there really are distortions in the European Union in agriculture, we need to ensure, within the EU, that our farmers also have development perspectives. We cannot simply close our borders, however. That would be a signal that would heighten the sense of disappointment in the Arab Spring. For these reasons I will recommend to Members in my group that they vote in favour of this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find it fascinating how we continually observe that we are all so pleased with the changes that the Arab Spring has brought to North Africa. In every speech – at least in every sermon – we all say that we have to help the people of this region. In other debates, we track the stream of refugees heading our way from North Africa. Why are they coming here? They are coming here because of the economic and political situation in their homelands, which remains poor in many cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">In every sermon we say that we have to help the people. What is at issue now is tangible help for people in a specific region, in a specific country and suddenly many of us are chickening out and expressing misgivings. The expression of misgivings is actually a good thing, but it is also part of the parliamentary procedure for us to have tackled many of these concerns, for us to have used the time over the last few weeks and months to consider, for example, misgivings expressed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and to also incorporate elements into our resolution. Our resolution – which, of course, will be voted on on Thursday – clearly sets out a large number of basic conditions. We have also said quite clearly that, should any truly detrimental impact on European agriculture become evident, we will demand appropriate steps and action from the Commission. It would be truly terrible, however, if our first signal to Morocco were to be that we reject this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">One illustration of how important this region is for us can be seen from the fact that the Spanish prime minister’s first foreign trip after taking office is not to an EU country, but to the other side of the Mediterranean, to the other side of the Straits of Gibraltar, to hold discussions with the Moroccans. This is also a clear sign that our political leaders have recognised that we do need to enter into dialogue in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am absolutely convinced that this agreement is a small step. The impact on our agriculture should be limited, and that is something that we do need to monitor strictly.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, there is one point on which Parliament has found a broad consensus over the last few weeks. This concerns the need to change the neighbourhood policy towards southern Mediterranean countries, particularly in view of the changes taking place which are producing significant improvements in the spread of democracy, and opening a whole new chapter in the EU’s approach to these countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Now we need to be consistent and not oscillate between extremes when implementing this neighbourhood policy. It would be absurd and inexcusably incomplete if this policy merely called for more rights and democracy in these countries, and resolutely ignored everything else, starting with economic and trade issues. We have often stated that rights and democracy are established above all also through new economic and financial policies capable of stimulating growth in these countries. Democracy and social and economic growth are inextricably linked.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement with Morocco is part of this context. It aims at and must encourage mutual convenience in terms of free trade and the process of integrating the Mediterranean area. I am concerned about Mr Bové’s style of protectionism because, instead of helping the democratic process and rights in these countries, it in fact becomes an objective obstacle to them.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, last year Parliament’s Committee on Petitions asked the European Commission to amend the entry price system for fruit and vegetables entering the Union. This system allows products from third countries to enter fraudulently, as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) itself has stated. These products are primarily Moroccan tomatoes.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Governments of Spain, France and Italy issued a statement last year that made the same request. We can combat this fraud by amending the Regulation on application of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) for agricultural products, because the problem will not be resolved by aligning the Customs Code, Commissioner.</p>
      <p sl="es">For several years I have been speaking up within the Spanish Partido Popular about the need to stop new concessions to Morocco until such time as the European Union has the necessary instruments in place to ensure compliance with the agreement currently in force.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Commission argues that the Member States should control imports. However, what the Commission does not say is that the current entry price system prevents national customs authorities from being able to properly trace the prices declared by importers in order to check for irregularities.</p>

      <p sl="es">One proposal, which we submitted 14 years ago, addressed the regulation of entry prices. We recently received a reply from the Commission saying that this can be done in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP), but the market may collapse now as products enter. Oranges are currently being produced at EUR 0.26 a kilo.</p>
      <p sl="es">Another proposal was quota control – not only quota control but also the volume of exports not subject to quotas, which often flood the market in the more sensitive months.</p>
      <p sl="es">The third proposal was an impact assessment on the way in which European Union farmers’ incomes are affected. Did you know that the average income of a farming family in Spain is equivalent to the minimum wage? This is an extremely important matter.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fourthly, there is reciprocity for plant protection products. Reciprocity is key here. Lastly, compensation if farmers are affected.</p>
      <p sl="es">We will also be voting on a resolution submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament which includes all these claims. In an amendment tabled by Ms De Keyser and myself, we called for compensation of damages caused to farmers. However, we do not want this compensation to be provided as some kind of charity. What we want is dignity for farmers and for all Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="es">These are the five proposals we have put forward to the Commission, which we hope will be included now or in the future.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the signature of the agreement between the European Union and Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures on agricultural products and fishery products has an economic dimension and, above all, a political dimension.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The agreement with Morocco represents support for the rural development policy, support for local farmers as well as support for the democratic process that was initiated several months ago after the parliamentary election. This agricultural agreement is therefore a major component of the advanced status granted to the Kingdom of Morocco in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It also shows that the EU supports and encourages the programme of constitutional and democratic reforms in Morocco. Over and above the economic dimension, this agreement will formally enshrine the rapprochement between the European Union and Morocco. The credibility of the European Union is at stake. Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot maintain bilateral relations that merely limp along. That is why I would encourage you to vote in favour of the signature of this agreement. It is a balanced, coherent agreement, which we need so that we can open as soon as possible the negotiations on a free trade agreement.</p>

    <intervention id="2-400-000" speaker_id="36396" name="Gianluca Susta" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, the relevance to the EU of this agreement is more than just that of farmers in the south, although this is of course important. The southern shore of the Mediterranean will not develop peacefully or democratically if we retreat into autarchical nostalgia which could encourage the spread of anti-European sentiment on the African continent.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course it would have been preferable to pursue a multilateral approach with the countries of North Africa, in order to avoid future inequalities. Nevertheless this agreement appears to be balanced. It does not threaten many of our traditional products. Quota restrictions on six out of the fifteen most sensitive products exported by Morocco will remain. New opportunities are opening up for some of our products and for those to which total liberalisation will apply. Finally, the safeguarding clause offers an additional protective mechanism in the event of serious damage.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that this agreement does not resolve the ancestral issue of the Saharawi people. Every trade agreement needs to be accompanied by a courageous political initiative on the part of the EU to promote the values of liberty and justice in the world. However we cannot use the tragedy of the Saharawi people to safeguard a few individual sectoral economic interests. We can and must have the farsightedness of a trade policy vision that looks beyond its own immediate requirements – a vision that this agreement allows us to catch a glimpse of, and therefore I will vote for it.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the trade agreement with Morocco concerning fruit and vegetables is much more important than it sounds. Few things have damaged the economies in North Africa as much as the EU’s duties on fruit and vegetables, resulting in unemployment and poverty.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We are their largest market and we impose high duties on some of their most important export products. Minimum prices, which is what we are applying here, are among the most discouraging measures we can take, because it means the more productive they are, the higher the duties they face. It is an effective way to make them toe the line and to keep them in poverty. This agreement is therefore an important move away from an old policy.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We must not forget that the Arab Spring was actually started by a fruit and vegetable trader who took his own life in protest. I therefore hope that this agreement is merely the first step, that the Commission will go further and that we will soon have agreements with Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and perhaps one day even Syria.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Fine words about helping are not enough. What is needed is a helping hand and in this case the best helping hand is probably a reduction in duties. That is how we helped the Balkans after the war: by reducing duties so they could use trade to bring them prosperity. That is clearly also how we should help the countries in North Africa – trade for prosperity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, allow me briefly to describe the political context, which is essential for our discussion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">First of all, this is an agricultural agreement that was essential in the framework of the advanced status – as has been mentioned – but it is also essential in the final free trade partnership that we wish to maintain between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, there is the democratic process, as we have seen. The parliamentary election of 25 November was transparent. That is a source of pride for us but it is also an example of what has also been done in Morocco itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly, we must highlight the very significant efforts made by the new government, especially the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr El Othmani, who is in talks with Algeria, Morocco’s neighbour, to find a solution to the problems of Western Sahara, and the UN is also involved. I therefore believe that it is not relevant to include Western Sahara in the discussion given the progress that we are seeing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should also remember that this agreement also serves to protect small Moroccan farmers; 70% of farms in Morocco have fewer than five hectares. We also know that the agreement is going to benefit European agricultural exports.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, I would like to put a question to the European Commissioner: what additional measure do you hope to take to enable, for example, our farmers in southern Europe to benefit from the EU Globalisation Fund and thus obtain that support from the European Union?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are voting in favour of this agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to contest the method used in this agreement on which we will be voting next Thursday, because we can no longer continue with bilateral agreements. Instead we need multilateral negotiations capable of giving us far broader feedback that is possible with a single agreement.</p>
      <p sl="it">Every time we enter into bilateral agreements it is always European farmers who pay the price. In this case too it seems to me that the cost is too high, and therefore I will be voting against the agreement, one reason also being that it does not contain a reciprocity clause, a fundamental component – and of course Parliament cannot make amendments to it.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are opening up our market when there is still duty on the export of meat and other products from Europe to Morocco. Furthermore, reciprocity also presupposes compliance with manufacturing conditions and guarantees for European consumers. Instead of which we are opening up our market without giving European consumers sufficient guarantees, and putting farmers in southern Europe into situations of great hardship, especially those in Mediterranean areas.</p>
      <p sl="it">I will therefore vote against the agreement.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, to date there have been numerous occasions – and there will be more in the future – when we have needed to take a stand on sensitive and important issues such as this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="el">We have repeatedly stressed that trade agreements are basically political agreements, as we proved a short while ago with the agreement with Uzbekistan. It is perfectly clear that, if we say no to this agreement, we shall freeze our relations with Morocco and basically we shall have no access to or say on a series of important issues. It is important for the European Union to continue to cooperate with this country, in order to encourage reforms in what are important sectors for us.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Union has had good and honest dialogue with Morocco to date on political issues, within the framework of the bodies responsible for continuing the Association Agreement. A negative stand will simply blow that dialogue to pieces. Finally, we need this agreement in order to safeguard the interests of European farmers. Besides, there are safety valves in this agreement that will kick in if imports of agricultural products from Morocco disrupt the European market. I would ask the European Commission to confirm that once again.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, you fulfil your duties well. You defend a text with conviction. This is not your text, however. It is an inherited text. We know very well that, if you had had to negotiate this text yourself, it would have been different because you are currently involved in the CAP negotiations and you are aware that it is difficult to impose environmental constraints on European farmers when texts such as this proposal ignore that issue completely. You are aware that it is difficult to establish a common framework for the CAP because the standard of living differs from one EU country to another. Here, we are not taking into account the standard of living of Moroccan producers, whom, we are supposed to believe, represent El Dorado.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Yes, the situation is complicated as I am sure that nobody here in this House wants to jeopardise Morocco’s development. Morocco is a country that we need for stability in North Africa. Morocco is a gateway for developing new trade and we know that every time we develop new trade, both parties benefit to some extent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, I will get back to what I was saying about the environment. How are we going to explain to European farmers that we are perhaps going to force them to comply with the Water Framework Directive under the system of cross-compliance but that at the same time we are not going to pay any attention to the production conditions of the tomatoes that are allowed to enter? How are we going to explain to them that the water table is falling by two metres per year in some regions but that that is being ignored?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I firmly believe that the model that we are proposing to the Moroccans is not a sustainable model. Perhaps our producers do not have to worry because, with the system they are being offered, Moroccan producers will die before them. This is serious, however. In my opinion, we have to defend Morocco, we have to defend democracy in Morocco but we also have to take care to ensure that what we are proposing is balanced from an environmental, social and economic perspective.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I listened very carefully to the speech by the Commissioner on the current process of adaptation to the Treaty of Lisbon. However, as others have already pointed out, there has been no sharing in this legislative process, which should lead to the conclusion of an agreement between the Commission and Morocco on a number of fruit and vegetable products that are an important reference, particularly for the economies of southern European countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are no geographical indications. Much can be said about plant-health controls: there is no reciprocity, quality standards are not high, and above all there is no sharing. While we are of the opinion that support for the democratisation process taking place in Morocco should be both robust and concrete, we cannot vote for an agreement that would undoubtedly be a danger and have serious consequences for all the farmers for whom Europe still offers opportunities for development and competition.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I understand the concerns that have been expressed. Although I have some doubts about certain political hijacking, or exploitation with regard to the rights of the people who are affected but not involved, I also have the same questions about the consequences of the liberalisation on the sectors of activity that are already highly vulnerable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why it is essential, Commissioners, to put in place effective compensatory measures to avoid any negative repercussions on European production and jobs. On that condition, I support this agreement because economic expansion in Morocco is an essential lever in consolidating a democratic process that all of us in this House sincerely want to see in that strategic part of the Mediterranean basin.</p>

      <p sl="it">Italian farmers, and southern Italian farmers should know that we are voting against it. We are announcing our intention to all the farmers growing tomatoes, fruit and vegetables, citrus fruits, grapes, peaches and cherries, who risk being not just threatened but beaten by the entry onto the market of products from Morocco, where there are no assurances regarding environmental quality standards, the fertilisers used and social standards such as welfare and salary guarantees for farm workers.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, these products from Morocco would enter our market with minimal duty or even without duty, while our oil and meat would be subject to duty. Well, we are absolutely against this. In southern Italy we are witnessing farm bankruptcies, job losses and the abandonment of land. This agreement risks making the process even worse, while we want to stop it.</p>

The first is a fearful reaction to the liberalisation of trade that will benefit both the European Union and, of course, Morocco, bearing in mind, of course, the terms of protection for sensitive European products. The other has to do with the political problem of the people of the Western Sahara.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, if the agreement is not ratified, that will do nothing whatsoever to improve the position of the people of the Western Sahara. On the contrary, we need to address these issues directly. At the same time – and I think this is a point of paramount importance – we should not forget that, by promoting economic growth throughout the Southern Mediterranean, we are doing a great deal to help consolidate democracy and achieve political stability at a crucial juncture in the Arab Spring. I think that is the main objective of the European Union and, obviously, of the European Parliament.</p>

Morocco has made and is making progress – and it is right that it should do – but this does not mean that we should damage our agricultural economy. It must not result in penalisation of European agriculture, especially in southern Italy and – why not? – for my region Sicily.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe there is also a little hypocrisy in all the arguments I have heard. We are justifying the Arab Spring as a necessary condition for all of this to take place, for this agreement to be concluded, while we know perfectly well that Moroccan farmers will benefit from it. We are well aware that major financial groups have already acquired part of those interests and those markets. We are well aware that once more we are taking Europeans for a ride.</p>

Those that benefit are major European retailers and multinational carriers, which will be able to win new markets and access cheap labour, as well as having the chance to avoid the social, employment and environmental standards in force in European countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The losers are European producers, in particular small and medium-sized producers of typically Mediterranean crops, particularly fruit and vegetables, since this agreement increases the pressure they are feeling today from low base prices and the difficulties experienced by many producers in selling all their produce.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Another loser is family farming, which will start facing competition from intensive production for export. These are models that jeopardise environmental sustainability, the viability of regional and local markets, and food sovereignty; they also degrade food quality and safety.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For these reasons, consumers and the public also lose. Furthermore, with this agreement, the Commission is also insisting on ignoring the problem of Western Sahara, which is illegally occupied under international law.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Europeans have to abide by strict and demanding food-quality and safety standards, and agro-environmental and animal welfare standards, which considerably increase the cost of production. However, the required certification and labelling do not protect them sufficiently or encourage consumers to give preference to their products over those produced to lower standards and at lower cost.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The liberalisation of 55% of exports from Morocco to the European Union and the increase in concessions in the fruit and vegetable sectors represents a severe blow to producers in southern Europe, particularly Portugal, but also Spain, Italy, Greece and France.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am not in favour of this agreement and many S&amp;D colleagues agree with me for three main reasons. First, this agreement is a fait accompli . It is an additional example of an international action undertaken by the Commission without any consultation with Parliament, and Commissioner Füle informed us that it is not possible to modify it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, the arguments against this agreement put forward by colleagues concerned with the fate of small European and Moroccan producers are very strong. A precipitous liberalisation could bring significant damage, as has occurred in many places already. Moreover, I do not believe that there is any connection between the Arab Spring and democratisation on the one side, and the extent of tomato production in North Africa, on the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, the most important reason why I am against this agreement is that it does not mention one fundamental fact: the rights of the Sahrawi people who are harassed by Morocco and whose territory is occupied by it, and the fact that these rights are not alluded to directly or indirectly by its clauses. I am very sorry that the Commission did not find the courage to clearly say that these agreements exclude the territory of Western Sahara.</p>

      <p sl="it">You have spoken about democratic links with Morocco. Well, in Morocco 22% of the population has the vote, it is one of the countries with the greatest illiteracy levels, farmers and fishermen do not have the right to form trade-unions there and everything is in the hands of the King.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me to clarify a number of aspects that have been raised here.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, some of you spoke about unfair competition and the lack of impact studies. I will give you two figures: tomato production in the European Union totals 6 million tonnes per year. The concessions we are offering Morocco under this agreement involve increasing the quota by 52 000 tonnes, which represents 0.8% of tomato production in the European Union. Moreover, with the entry price system and this quantity being allocated to specific months, we are protecting the European market from Moroccan tomatoes between June and September, when production reaches its peak in the European Union. For the rest of the year this quantity is divided between the remaining months.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I had also spoken about the entry prices, Mrs Herranz García and Mr Mato Adrover, and I listened to your comments and those of the Agriculture Ministers of the countries involved. That is why I proposed aligning the system for calculating entry prices with the European Union’s existing taxation system, precisely to avoid small quotas or small quantities of certain products, which are more advantageous, from resulting in all transport being calculated on that basis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It was in order to eliminate that type of problem that we proposed improving the entry price calculation system. I can assure you that we are also going to monitor the way in which the Member States carry out customs checks at their borders once this change is made.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some of you said that this agreement is going to benefit the multinationals rather than small farms, but I do not know if a trade agreement can encourage the development of a multinational or an operating model. You know that in the European Union these types of guidelines are laid down by our agricultural policy. Morocco also has its own agricultural policy and during the negotiations on this agreement it presented to us its Green Plan, in which the Moroccan Government has at least expressly agreed to provide support for small farms, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You also mentioned land monopolies. According to the information we have received from the Moroccan Government, and this is clearly set out in the Green Plan, too, foreigners’ access to land is limited to 100 000 hectares in Morocco and individual farms can be no larger than a few thousand hectares. In any case, Mr Bové, that is what the Moroccan Government has told us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards respect for sanitary standards, as I said in my initial speech, we will ensure during border checks that products from Morocco, and from other parts of the world, comply with our sanitary and phytosanitary standards. All of the food safety standards imposed on our producers are thus applied to Moroccan producers and, indeed, the recent inspections by the EU Food and Veterinary Office in Morocco demonstrate that it now has the capacity to carry out these checks through the institutions that it has set up. Our technical assistance programmes in Morocco also focus on capacity-building for the future.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You mentioned, too, the impact on the environment, and water consumption in particular. The information we have available indicates that the average water consumption for one kilogram of tomatoes in Morocco is 47 litres, while 45 litres are used in the European Union. That figure is therefore not too far from the European Union average, or at least that is the figure we have, Mr Bové. With the drip-feed technological system that Morocco hopes to develop under its Green Plan, as far as we are aware, that consumption could be reduced further.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Once again, however, we cannot use an agreement to impose on a government choices that are its responsibility. I believe that, if we respect the self-determination of a state such as Morocco, we must have faith in the information it gives us when taking decisions, including decisions on an agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thank you very much for these clarifications. I think that my colleague Štefan Füle will give you some more information on the non-agricultural aspects that you also raised in your speeches.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, today’s debate touches on many fundamental issues about the Europe we want to build. Do we want to build a Europe open to the world? Are we serious about establishing a close partnership with our neighbours? Are we serious about the ‘more for more’ and mutual accountability principle?</p>
      <p sl="en">The vote by this House on the agricultural agreement with Morocco will determine some of the answers to these questions. As my colleague Commissioner Cioloş stated, Morocco is an important partner of the European Union. We concluded an agreement on advanced status in 2008 and the entry into force of the agricultural agreement will give substance to the advanced status. It will create investment opportunities for European Union companies and help provide jobs in Morocco, therefore reducing the temptation to find better living opportunities abroad thus stretching further our migration capacity and policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me make three additional points. First, on the Western Sahara, I would like to confirm that the post-Lisbon European Union is committed to doing more to find a solution to the conflicts of our neighbourhood. We are also keen to promote regional cooperation in the Maghreb and support efforts made by Algeria and Morocco to normalise their relations.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many positive steps have been taken recently and the Commission is determined to provide both political and technical support. We care very much about human rights in the Western Sahara. Overall, we consider that the situation in Morocco has improved over the years and this movement needs to be encouraged further. We will continue to follow events closely and intervene whenever appropriate, including by supporting trial observation and with specific démarches.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the occasion of the political dialogue with Morocco we will continue to raise our concerns when appropriate. Let me make it clear that the de facto Moroccan administration in the Western Sahara is already under a legal obligation to comply with the principles of international law, which provides that the activities related to natural resources are lawful as long as they are not implemented in disregard of the needs, interests and benefits of the local population.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are committed to monitoring closely the impact of the agreement on the population of Western Sahara. We will use the existing agriculture and fisheries subcommittee established by the Association Agreement to gather this information and to keep Parliament informed. I welcome the fact that Morocco has committed to providing information on the regional impact of the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now a second remark on the importance of agreement in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Arab Spring: let me stress that the rejection of this agreement would send a negative signal to all our Arab partners engaged in the difficult process of democratisation and reform, for whom greater trade opportunities with the European Union will be a source of jobs and economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">More broadly, let me recall that this Parliament last December supported the new approach for the European Neighbourhood Policy and in particular the vision of the gradual economic integration of our neighbours into our internal market. So let me stress that, despite what some of you said, we have a strategy to support forces behind the Arab Spring. You voted for it, and the opening of markets was an integral part of it. The agreement with Morocco is indeed a building block of this exercise, and its adoption will send a very positive and encouraging signal to all our neighbourhood partners in the east and south.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now a third point on the resolution: let me conclude by thanking Members of this House for their positive collaboration in the preparation of the resolution. We take your resolution very seriously. My colleague has indicated a number of areas of concern to Parliament where we will work intensively once the agreement with Morocco enters into force</p>
      <p sl="en">With a particular regard for your concerns, the Commission will monitor closely the effect of the agreement both in Europe and in Morocco and in all policy dimensions. The monitoring will start on the first day of the entry into force of the agreement and it will be a continual process.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, let me also state that much has been done to meet most of the five demands mentioned by the Spanish parliamentarians from the S&amp;D Group. The Commission will also launch an impact assessment for the negotiation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade area with Morocco and other partners in the southern Mediterranean. I am keen to ensure that the Commission will deliver on its commitments, and you can count on our personal engagement to this effect.</p>

It is a sign that, if we want to bolster development and reforms in North Africa, we need to demonstrate this by means of practical initiatives that create economic growth and bind us closer together. That is precisely the purpose of this agreement. If it is rejected, we will send completely the wrong signal to both Morocco and the other North African countries.</p>
      <p sl="da">To Mr Bové and all the others who have expressed their scepticism and opposition to the agreement I would just like to say that I respect your views, but I do not agree with your conclusion. I would like to remind you that the agreement contains provisions that give the EU the right to limit imports from Morocco if they create significant disturbance on the European market or harm production, and it also takes account of products that are particularly sensitive in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="da">No political agreements are completely black and white when compromises are made. However, this agreement is particularly important because it will send the first important signal to North Africa following the Arab Spring. It is now that the EU has the opportunity to back-up its fine words and strong values with action in the form of an agreement which will make a tangible difference to the people of North Africa. This is an agreement that will send a clear message that the EU takes action and supports democratisation, free trade and a partnership based on trust, trade and democratic values. Therefore, it is about more than just trade when the Members of this House vote on Thursday. It is a question of whether the EU will fulfil the promises it has made concerning close cooperation and providing support for the forces of democratic reform, which need and deserve our support.</p>
      <p sl="da">With these words on behalf of the Council, I strongly urge all of the Members of this Parliament to vote in favour of this agreement.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, we have just had a debate that, in spite of everything, was interesting because for the first time it was a real debate on a free trade agreement.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some people referred to the facts, others to ideology, even belief, belief in free trade as a stepping stone to democracy. I hope that those people do not find themselves one day in a situation where they have to face the people who have suffered because of free trade agreements, of any kind: today the peasant farmers who produce fruit and vegetables, or tomorrow the meat producers when it is time for the Mercosur agreement. I believe that this free trade agreement is a bad agreement, especially for Morocco’s peasant farmers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If the ‘yes’ vote prevails on Thursday – which is of course possible as I do not know what will happen – it will mean that you are creating all of the conditions for the Arab Spring to arrive finally in Morocco. That means that you will be in a bit of a strange situation tomorrow. In fact, the agreement provides for an increase of more than 50% for European products on Moroccan territory, compared with just 15% for Moroccan products in Europe, which means that hundreds of thousands of Moroccan families are going to be thrown out on the street because of these exports to their country. Is that what you want?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I get the impression today that you are not talking about the reality. You refuse to talk about the reality. We are accepting this agreement because Morocco is promising to protect us from the immigration from Africa. That is what is happening and it also features in all of your texts. Are we concluding economic agreements solely to build a wall on the other side of the Mediterranean to protect Europe?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to get serious! We have to get back to the actual facts, and the actual facts all come down to agriculture. However, this agreement is a bad plan for agriculture. A 1% increase in volume over what is offered could lead to prices collapsing. As you are all too aware, Commissioner, the balance between supply and demand is very fragile. A 1% adjustment can make prices collapse and have devastating consequences.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know that Perpignan is currently a key transit point for tomatoes. We know that the head offices of the two largest firms, Azura and Idyl, are located in France. We know that today. So why are we continuing in this manner? We also know that the Commission has internal EU documents that show that more than 700 000 hectares were given to the Persian Gulf fund. You cannot deny that today; it is the Commission’s own documents that prove it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need to get serious when it comes to the issue of water, too. We are told today that there is no information about water, even though European universities, in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, in addition to Moroccan universities are providing figures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not need to say any more. As regards our obligation to Western Sahara, I did not want to turn it into a political battle, but simply to raise a point of law. Indeed, the law is clear-cut. If Western Sahara is not excluded from this agreement tomorrow, you could face the possibility of action before the European Court of Justice.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The agricultural trade agreement to be signed between the EU and Morocco is contrary to the interests of both European consumers and European farmers. It is contrary to the interests of consumers because it would facilitate the entry onto EU markets of vegetable and fruit products that have often been treated using plant protection products already banned in the EU. In the past few years there have been multiple incidents of Moroccan pepper containing residues of banned chemicals being found in Hungary. The agreement is also contrary to the interests of European farmers who must comply with increasingly stringent EU environmental and food safety rules, while imports from Morocco remain outside the scope of these rules. Spanish farmers have pointed out that the European Commission did not prepare any impact assessment whatsoever concerning the foreseeable effects of such imports. We agree with and support the position of COPA-COGECA – the largest organisation of farmers in Europe, of which MAGOSZ, the Hungarian Association of Farmers’ Societies and Cooperatives, is also a member – which demands the rejection of the agreement.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The intensification of trade between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco will undoubtedly assist in the economic development of that country. However, liberalisation of the exchanges of agricultural products may have catastrophic results for European agriculture. Moroccan products do not meet many of the European health, environmental or food safety standards. The increase in fruit and vegetable imports will result in enormous distortion of competition in this sector. At a time of economic crisis, this may even lead to unemployment among many producers. It is essential to strengthen the effectiveness of the Union’s import control and safety system and to require the Moroccan producers to comply with the same standards as European producers are required to observe.</p>

There is a broad consensus across Parliament regarding Morocco’s involvement in EU programmes, a text which was voted on earlier and for which I was the shadow rapporteur. This Protocol is in keeping with the advanced status Morocco enjoys in its relations with the EU. It will allow Morocco to get effectively involved in devising and supervising the implementation of current and future EU programmes. Furthermore, Morocco is treated as an equal partner of the Member States because (subject to the possible financial aid it could apply for) it will contribute to the EU budget for the programmes of interest to it. I can only hope that we will also successfully find the same consensus for the EU–Morocco Agreement on agricultural and fishery products. I believe that the repercussions this agreement will have for the agricultural and fisheries sectors at EU level are dealt with appropriately in the final text. On the other hand, our Moroccan partners regard this agreement as a test of the credibility of our commitment to support a country involved in a huge reform process being carried out on a consensual basis.</p>

Our farmers are obliged to compete with cheaper products originating from outside the EU, which fail to meet the same standards of hygiene or animal welfare. I would like to stress that European farmers need to be compensated for the losses suffered as a result of deregulating agricultural trade with Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also believe that we need to show solidarity with Morocco, given the fragile political situation in this region. However, we must not forget that the intensification of agriculture in this country will result in excessive use of water resources and could also cause serious environmental problems.

      <p sl="fr">We must ensure that there is free, undistorted competition and we must defend the interests of European agricultural operators. If market imbalances appear, compensatory measures to help European farmers will have to be implemented. With the expansion of the Moroccan market, we are going to be able to increase our exports to that country, too.</p>

    <intervention id="2-427-000" speaker_id="23820" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President">
      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the question for oral answer to the Commission by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds (O-000333/2011 – B7-0022/2012).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-428-000" speaker_id="33570" name="Sharon Bowles" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am presenting this oral question and resolution on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. We postponed the debate from the last Strasbourg session as Commissioner Rehn could not attend. So we are disappointed that, once more, other duties have called him away.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are well aware, in the Committee, of all the strands of the arguments, from those that inherently support common stability bonds to those of the opposite view. But we are of the view that, in some form, they are part of the picture. If we look back at our attempts to stabilise the euro zone crisis, they can be characterised as believing that, within a monetary union, a small part would not bring down the whole, just as one city or state does not bring down the US.</p>
      <p sl="en">There has been a belief that, because of the political commitment of the whole, the deterioration in a highly-indebted Member State would not follow the path of that experienced in other individual indebted countries. We can blame delay and prevarication for our attempts always being behind the curve, but it is time to examine missing elements too, including the fact that what we do also marks the level of ambition and commitment to the next stage of evolution of the monetary union and to the euro’s place as a reserve currency. In other words, ambition counts: maybe even more so in this time of awful austerity. Therefore we are anxious to learn what are the interim results of the consultation on stability bonds and, based on the consultation, what are the next steps foreseen by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the Green Paper was issued in October, there have been further political agreements – such as those of the European Council in December – which have also been carried forward. These decisions to enhance the sustainability of public finances also contribute towards creating the necessary conditions for the potential introduction of stability bonds. Therefore, what kind of policy instrument would be the most effective in the short term?</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said with regard to ambition, stability bonds would show that there is a medium term plan beyond austerity. The ‘redemption pact’ proposed by the German Council of Economic Experts shows a long-term way that excess debt could be handled. There is some similarity between that plan and how the Australian states first moved to common issuance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Neither should we overlook the possibility of short-term euro bills. I dubbed these once ‘the beginner’s bond’, but they could be both time- and quantity-limited, with good behaviour needed to allow rollover. Bills also have the advantage of lower interest rates and in these times of high debt, struggling fellow-Member States do need every single basis point squeezed off what they have to pay.</p>
      <p sl="en">From a personal point of view, taking that overriding necessity of squeezing down debt servicing payments, I would see eventual recirculation of the profit element of bond interventions by the European Central Bank back to the indebted Member State as a reasonable manoeuvre.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as I have not taken all my time, I would be happy if you would allocate the rest to Parliament’s rapporteur Sylvie Goulard.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-429-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Neelie Kroes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Vice-president of the Commission . − Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to replace my dear colleague Olli Rehn. The consultation on the Green Paper on the stability bonds finished on 8 January. It is fair to admit that the feedback via the official channels of this consultation has been quite limited. We have received only 18 replies to the internet questionnaire and to DG ECFIN’s functional mail box. These replies came mostly from private citizens and to a lesser extent from different institutions.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus I would hesitate to consider this feedback as representative. I would also hesitate to consider those replies as substantially helping or guiding us in deciding about useful next steps as regards possible common issuance in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, in the mean time we have had many other informal contacts and consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, academics, financial institutions and government representatives. Also this House has been and will continue to be crucial in this debate. I am grateful for the first indications and views by Sharon Bowles and Sylvie Goulard on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in their motion for a resolution of 21 December, and I would in particular like to thank Ms Goulard for all her initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="en">These additional contacts have proved highly useful and productive. Yet they only further illustrate the basic choices and trade-offs that we face when envisaging any form of common issuance in the euro area. Such an instrument can deliver very tangible, positive results on the integration and stability of European capital markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">The more ambitious our approach is, the higher benefits it will bring. At the same time the possible challenges remain daunting. We would have to ensure that solidarity and guarantees across Member States for the large-scale funding of governments do not weaken the incentives of governments to good fiscal behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="en">What becomes clear from the consultations and informal contacts is the necessity to keep it simple. Complicated structures or instruments, based on complex financial engineering, are considered with a fair amount of suspicion and investors’ hesitance.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is also clear is that stability bonds should not be reduced to being seen as just another item in the arsenal of potential short-term crisis tools. Yes, if deployed quickly, and depending on their specific form, they can make an important contribution to the current sovereign debt crisis, but in their essence Eurobonds or stability bonds have a much larger potential.</p>
      <p sl="en">They can profoundly contribute to integrating European capital markets at their core, thereby fostering efficiency and the international attractiveness of Europe as an investment location. In brief, our goal should be to create a strong, simple and creditworthy new instrument that would be likely to become the new risk-free benchmark on European financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">In terms of the next steps, given the ambitious goal and the importance of the issue, the Commission plans to further clarify the key issues linked to the introduction of Eurobonds. There are many quite technical topics to be analysed before any definite decisions are taken and we must take the time to do so, as nothing should be left to chance here.</p>
      <p sl="en">The new economic governance as agreed by the European Council in December is a welcome development. We do need more fiscal consolidation, also in the context of the Eurobonds. As I have said before, Eurobonds without fiscal consolidation will not work, and I strongly believe that we will have to combine those two. In that respect, many respondents to the consultation of the Green Paper have pointed to the merits of keeping financial markets as a signalling and corrective device for the conduct of economic and fiscal policies in Member States. Hence, a full substitution of Member States’ issuance by common issuance would, according to those voices, not be advisable.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have studied with interest some proposals to link joint issuance …</p>
      <a text="(Interjection from Mr Bloom: ‘Three minutes, we’re now getting up to six – let’s do our job, Mr President.’)"/>
      <p sl="en">… explicitly to fiscal coordination by Member States and to limit the time frame of joint issuance, at least initially, to the time needed to redress Member States’ government accounts to sustainable levels. In particular the proposal of the German Council of Economic Experts for a debt redemption fund goes in that direction.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last sentence – and this is my last sentence, Mr President – concerns an interesting issue. When mapping out the way forward we all will have to keep in mind the limitations of the approaches presented in the Green Paper and strike the right balance in terms of …</p>
      <a text="(Interjection from the President: ‘The time is also a barrier.’)"/>
      <p sl="en">… respective advantages and disadvantages to market integration efficiency and stability. I count on the European Parliament to play an important and constructive role in this process.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the question asked here today and the Green Paper on stability bonds result from the work done in this Parliament on the six pack. This is an agreement between Parliament and the Commission to add a growth perspective to the idea of stability and the required discipline.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In November, Parliament heard President Barroso highlight the Commission’s lines of action: growth, discipline and talk of issuing joint debt. President Barroso said that the euro area could solve its problems, and that issuing joint debt could be done with more oversight, more discipline and coordination, with true economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, we face a great challenge. Europe has already produced many documents: Europe 2020 strategy, the roadmap to stability and growth, the Euro Plus Pact and the Annual Growth Survey. The European semester, the Commission programme geared towards growth, is also a recent interinstitutional agreement. We are open to short-term solutions being considered, such as those proposed by the wise Germans. We are open to other solutions that are more medium- and long-term. However, we would say that now is the time to see the path ahead; a path that requires determination and decisiveness. In this regard, however few responses there might be to Commission proposals, Parliament will always be here.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, enough time has passed since the current crisis started for a vigilant observer to note that the crisis resolution remedies are not working. Much energy and time was lost by our EU institutions in devising ways to prevent a sovereign debt crisis from occurring again, rather than addressing the more immediate present and clear danger by a proper crisis resolution mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unfortunate that the two largest countries have ignored the early advice given in Parliament by some groups, including ours, that fiscal austerity on its own cannot by itself get us out of our predicament. While it is obvious that the current medicine is not doing any good, the reaction to this state of affairs is unfortunately not to do the logical thing and change the medicine, but to give more of it on the pretext that the dose is not strong enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report on Eurobonds is one important plea for sanity. It is a direct constructive proposal for a change to the current effective euro zone architecture. It is an opportunity for the euro zone to show that it is not just offering a knee-jerk solution to the latest downgrade, but clear-headed thinking. It is not a total cure, but it should be seen as a building block to the already set foundation of a European stability mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we cannot introduce a Eurobond in a matter of weeks or even months. The most we can do – and the aim of our resolution based on the Green Paper goes in that direction – is to issue a credible statement of intent, thus setting in motion a change of legal events to bring about the needed changes. But in doing so we would be strengthening the case for bestowing the EFSF-ESM with the much-needed banking licence which will supplement the ECB’s successful purchasing exercise at the end of last year. The contagion is spreading and it has started eating at the core. Let us stop it before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like you to let Mr Rehn know that we are very disappointed that he cannot be here this evening. We had postponed this debate for him and I think that it is an important issue, even though we know that he has serious responsibilities in relation to Greece.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the six-pack, as Diogo Feio pointed out, we fought for the Eurobonds issue to be dealt with rigorously. This was stated in my report and my objective was two-fold: it was to show that those who were permanently opposed could be mistaken and that those who were going to vote in favour tomorrow morning were ignoring a number of problems.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to thank the Commission for having contributed to this in-depth work with its Green Paper. I think that there are some measures that need to be taken immediately and others that are more long-term. In the report that I will prepare, that is the direction that we would like to take, presenting a roadmap that makes a clear distinction between what can be done immediately and what will of course require significant legal steps, and that is an important point, which is why I am emphasising it for my colleagues with difficulties.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the short term, I believe that it would be extremely important – as has already been mentioned – to help highly-indebted Member States to fulfil the very strict commitments that they made in the six-pack in terms of the rate at which they reduce their debt. We need to help them, not just by imposing standards but by finding ways of meeting them effectively.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe fully supports the idea of the redemption fund or Tilgungsfonds du Sachverständigungsrat proposed by Germany.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, I must highlight one extremely important point. At the moment we are focusing on the crisis and we are forgetting why we wanted to forge a currency together. That currency has a global objective, which is to contribute to the stability, at global level, of the various currencies and, as you said, to offer foreign investors a chance to invest in a region that we hope is stable – and we are working on that – and that has a liquid market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a long-term objective and it is an objective that goes hand in hand with the political union, which is linked to the single currency. We are ready to work towards that objective, as Diogo Feio said, and perhaps to go even beyond what the Commission proposes. In any event, that is the way I see it. It is a long-term project that aims to ensure that the euro takes its rightful place among the global currencies and to make the European Union, to an even greater extent than today, a political union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have one final comment to make: it seems, Commissioner, and I do not wish to be disagreeable, that, contrary to what normally happens, you have not published the responses to the consultation. To begin with, you set extremely short deadlines because the responses had to be in by 8 January, which was not a very convenient date, and as far as I am aware – unless I am mistaken – the responses are not to be found on your website.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that this is a transparency issue. We do not hide anything from the citizens, and we would like to know exactly what all of the parties concerned said openly and be able to respond to them.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this situation reminds me of the time when, as a House, we took a cross-party decision that we wanted a financial transactions tax at European level, too. Tomorrow – and I am convinced of this – there will be a broad majority in favour of further steps towards common bonds in Europe. That is important for this crisis. With such a majority, Parliament would be sending out a clear signal that – in contrast to what many of the national parliaments and sections of the public have been happy to say – stability bonds are no work of the devil and instead have important benefits. This joint declaration shows that. They have important benefits, they provide a deep market that, at the end of the day, is highly liquid and thus capable of providing lower interest rates for all of Europe’s Member States for the long term. It is a prerequisite for communally secured debt that there is functional fiscal policy and that the budgets are sound. Ultimately, only when that is in place can there be large-scale communally secured debt. Comments of this kind have to be tempered, however, as we have long had communally secured debt in the European Investment Bank and the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).</p>
      <p sl="de">It is also important, however – and this is my second point – that this resolution shows that the strategy pursued by the Council to handle the crisis up to now is illusory. A number of countries have major solvency problems and simple economic calculations show that involving private creditors in Greece was simply not enough. Similarly, austerity alone cannot solve the problems in these countries – nor can growth alone. Simple calculations by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy show that the primary surplus of countries such as Portugal and also Greece is too high – even after the debt haircut for Greece that has still not quite been adopted – to ultimately see these countries emerge from the crisis. That is why the model put forward by the German Council of Economic Experts of having low interest rates to finance pre-existing debt is important.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I beg you to take this back to your fellow Commissioners. Do not allow yourselves to be sidetracked by the resistance of a few Member States. Without low interest rates for everyone, there is no way out of the euro crisis. You must, therefore, fall back on the Council of Economic Experts’ model. Examine the other models, too, and bring forward a bold and definitive proposal. The voice of Parliament is telling you that we want you to make your submission quickly.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, sovereign issuance of debt is a national necessity and a way in which national governments can raise the funding required to pay for their policy delivery. The cost of funding to a sovereign is the single most important method of ensuring they do not live beyond their means.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fiscal prudence and the direct relationship between lender and borrower, in this case the Member State and the financial investors in government bond markets, are the brakes on the system, preventing overspending in the short, medium, and long term. Currently sovereign issuance in the euro zone is still conducted individually by euro zone Member States, but the stability bonds being proposed would entail a significant pooling of sovereign issuance. It remains to be seen whether a stability bond could be designed so that it does not lead to an increased risk of moral hazard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Removing the direct link between a sovereign and its investor is a risky strategy. However, designing a stability bond which delivers a reduced cost of debt for some poorer euro zone countries at an acceptable expense for the more wealthy is as big a challenge. As the German Ambassador recently said to a House of Lords inquiry, stability bonds are not a solution to the existing crisis. If there is any debate about Eurobonds this is not the time to have it. This is something that could be the crown to an existing fiscal union, but it would have very great moral hazard in an incomplete monetary union. We need to listen to his wisdom. If a Member State spends or borrows too much, it risks losing investor confidence. Collective issuance of debt will not disguise the fundamentals and investor confidence in the whole of the euro zone may unnecessarily be put at further risk.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, while the governments are capable of approving a new treaty at the speed of light, a debate like this on Eurobonds moves forward at a snail’s pace and in a forest of ambiguities. On one hand, we recognise that the euro area finds itself in a unique situation, with the euro area Member States sharing a single currency without a common fiscal policy or a European bond market. In view of this, the problems of the euro are not Greek, Portuguese or Irish, but European, because there cannot be a sound currency without a European budget worthy of the name and there cannot be a sound currency without the ability to issue bonds at that same level. On the other hand, however, the resolution also says that the stability of each country, budgetary stability, is a condition, a pre-condition, of Eurobonds. This is like telling someone who is sick that they only have the right to medicine if they are somehow miraculously cured. This is absurd. It makes no sense.</p>
      <p sl="pt">European bonds should be viewed in the long term as a public instrument for financing economies and not as a prize offered to governments for complying with the most ridiculous of agreements so far invented, the treaty reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact. European bonds should contribute to restructuring the debt of countries in difficulties or the history of the coming years will continue to be written in Greek and founded on large doses of austerity, humiliation and despair.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, in the 1970s the Community Reinvestment Act in the United States made due diligence in banking illegal. To pursue a political goal, the Administration laid open the pathway to what we now know as sub-prime debt. It proved to be – as I said it would at the time – a pathway to hell paved with good intentions. It was conceived to make banks lend to people who could not possibly repay.</p>
      <p sl="en">We politicians now love to blame the banks, but it started with politics. Sadly, politicians do not understand money. How else could we have got ourselves into this appalling mess? Yet we have learnt nothing; we are now advocating a form of Eurobond, a sub-prime debt instrument by any other name. Again, we are bailing out the banks at the expense of the taxpayer. The ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed are all at it: print money; give it to the banks to buy junk bonds – bogusly rated as double A – to shore up their reserves and guarantee salaries and bonuses that ordinary people can only wonder at.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have learnt nothing from the 2008 crisis. We are desperately clinging to a failed political ideal as our cities riot and burn.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when it comes to borrowing money, interest is not the only price you pay. Your creditor or guarantor will demand conditions for the loan. Stability bonds might facilitate borrowing by insolvent countries by providing a joint and several guarantee of repayment. However, the real price to be paid by the peoples of ailing countries, rather than their governments, will be even more budgetary constraints, leading to economic depression, greater unemployment, misery, homelessness and even suicide. For Greece, the cradle of democracy, the unelected Commission will determine tax and spending policies that should instead be determined by Greek voters through their elected representatives in their own national parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">These sacrifices might be worthwhile if they guaranteed prosperity for the ailing countries. However they are locked in a currency that is absurdly overvalued for their economies.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the past year has seen important steps taken to strengthen the basis of our Economic and Monetary Union. Crucial elements of this are the ‘six-pack’, the permanent emergency fund, the new treaty and the decision by the European Central Bank to lend our banks EUR 500 billion in three-year loans. There are still major problems, but confidence is gradually returning, and we must be ambitious enough to continue on our path towards lasting economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Therefore, on behalf of our group, I welcome the proposal that Commissioner Rehn has presented regarding the macro-economic surveillance. Structural reforms are needed to ensure growth and competitiveness in Europe. But we need to continue to reinforce our Economic and Monetary Union, for that is the basis of our welfare and employment. Hence the importance of discussing stability bonds, since the issue of these bonds is still split up between 17 different markets in Europe. As a result, we are losing out on significant advantages.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Eurobonds will not solve the present crisis and are no excuse for not carrying through necessary, if sometimes painful, economies and reforms. Stability bonds, however, may well make a very positive contribution in future to a far more efficient issuance of State bonds and offer advantages to all of us in Europe. The EP’s resolution is consequently also a significant encouragement to the European Commission in its plea for further investigation of this highly complicated matter. There is still a lot to be disentangled, so please persevere along your pathway, full of man-traps though it be, for, looking to the future, it is in the interest of all of us to work towards the issuance of joint bonds.</p>

Germany’s reservations were initially understandable, but are now groundless as it is possible to design Eurobonds that will allow some countries to cut the cost of their debt, without increasing it for others.</p>

I think Ms Goulard has done a good job in trying to address all of the criticisms put forward by those who are not very positive towards the Eurobond. At the same time, however, the fundamental challenge that some of us have with Eurobonds is whether we regard common issuance – in other words, joint liabilities – as something that is politically acceptable. This cannot be solved by technical solutions involving ‘red’ and ‘blue’ bond models and such like.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally am in favour of the redemption fund, and I want to remind this House that we have agreed together on the ‘six-pack’, the coming ‘two-pack’, the international agreement, etc. Hopefully, all of these will bring the European economies into balance, so why do we need Eurobonds at this stage, since at that point all countries should be able to get loans on the markets for a reasonable price?

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Eurobonds are an instrument that has to be strictly linked to conditions – the first condition, for example, being an extensive treaty change. Such a change is required because it has not been possible to introduce these Eurobonds under the existing European treaties. There is also a hidden meaning under paragraph 11 of the resolution, which refers to ‘appropriate legal requirements’. That simply will not do – only treaty change will suffice.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to my second point now, the resolution as a whole is the result of an intensive exchange of opinions. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Ms Goulard for having managed to incorporate in this resolution both the demand for Eurobonds and the misgivings raised about them, as well as the prerequisites. I therefore believe, even if there is a desire to hold separate votes about one point or another, that we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will vote in favour of this joint resolution with a large majority.</p>
      <p sl="de">That does not mean, however, that the problems will have been solved. The introduction of Eurobonds requires a treaty change approved by all 27 Member States. Even the proposal tabled by the German Council of Economic Experts for appraising economic development cannot hide the fact that even the communitarisation of debt over 60% requires a basis in the Treaties. We are on a long road and, in contrast to paragraph 7 of the resolution, I do not believe that the Commission has brought forward an excellent Green Paper, but a poorly produced one. Vice-President, you confirmed it yourself: there were only 18 interventions. I have never seen anything like that in the last 20 years. That can only go to prove that the Commission has not been doing its work so far.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, between May 2010 and now we have seen how a problem that appeared manageable has spiralled out of control. It is true that combating the crisis caused by the financial markets has further indebted the countries of the euro area and that the weakest have become particularly vulnerable. However, is it possible that countries sharing the same currency are to be left to the mercy of attacks by financiers and those who make money by betting on the likelihood of euro area countries defaulting? The terrible consequences of the inability to respond in the Council and the Commission have produced problems that are today indisputable. The speculative interest rates demanded of individual countries have undermined any strategy for emerging from the crisis. The resulting intensification of the country’s economic problems justify interest rates ballooning further until the country’s economy is killed by credit being totally cut off, with contagion doing the rest. For a long time, this Parliament has been proposing a form of joint management of sovereign debt, subject to tough, but clear, rules.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We welcome the fact the Commission has finally produced a Green Paper on the subject, using the name ‘stability bonds’. Today it is clear that, without bonds of this type, properly linked to the European stability mechanism, the so-called ‘crash barriers’, the sovereign debt firewalls, are non-existent; until they exist, the euro is in danger, as is Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the resolution adopted by the majority in Parliament on a new treaty, it was totally clear that it is unacceptable to continue imposing more fiscal stability rules, budgetary discipline and sanctions on euro area countries without taking concrete and urgent steps towards the joint management of sovereign debt. The two processes have to develop in parallel. This is what we expect from the Commission and it is already long overdue.</p>

However, the economies of each state are the sole responsibility of their respective governments. I therefore understand the caution of those governments that still have no difficulty in borrowing at a reasonable premium on the financial markets, as they do not wish to drag their countries into the dubious game of responsibility for the financial mismanagement of others.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If common stability bonds seem as beneficial an idea to the Commission and some Member States as they state in the Green Paper, they should now consider issuing common bonds for the group of countries that see a way out of the crisis in such a solution. We would all, for example, certainly watch closely the level of financial market interest in an issue of common stability bonds by a group of countries from southern Europe – Portugal, Spain and Cyprus – and the premium at which they would trade on the markets. If the premium was at the level of Germany’s, I would say that this solution might be beneficial for the European Union.</p>

Today, however, you did not come down on the side of any of the three and we are now at the point where we need to get a move on.</p>

We cannot avoid this fact.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first and second options of the Green Paper cannot be mutualised for a very simple reason, and that is that the guarantee is shared by all the Member States and therefore – as many have already mentioned – this gives rise to a moral hazard.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have to work on the third approach, if we want to take action quickly and immediately. This means that there would be no mutualisation of the debt, and we cannot work on this because I believe that it is also ethically right that we should not be able to touch on a problem that was decided with the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this case the debt in the form of Eurobonds would be made up of the best assets, and therefore this option is feasible and can be carried out swiftly by using, as I said, the best assets and the safest assets by means of liquid and gold reserves. I think that it is the only way forward at the current time – in other words, working on the third option of the Green Paper, because we would be hypocrites if we wanted to work on the first two in order to speed things up.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, the Commission’s proposals on stability bonds come in the wake of initiatives and exhortation by the European Parliament and I therefore warmly welcome this approach. However, I should like to clarify that our objective is not to painlessly resolve the problems of certain countries which are unable to address them on their own. The objective is effective, fair and solidarity-based debt management, without burdening the healthy countries and without certain other countries being forced to provide finance on what are, for them, very onerous terms.

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we need to be a little bit more honest again in this debate. What was the situation like before the euro was introduced? What were the interest rates like in Greece when it still had the drachma? What were the rates in Italy when it had the lira, or in Spain with the peseta and Portugal with the escudo? They were considerably higher than what has to be paid on the financial markets at the moment. Those Member States within the euro enjoyed the sweet poison of low interest rates for a decade, and pursued a spending policy that they are no longer on top of. For them to now say that they want to continue to enjoy that sweet poison via the introduction of Eurobonds is precisely the wrong reaction to have. Many mistakes were made here in the past that now need to be corrected. Anyone who believes that this problem would be solved by making the drug that is low interest rates available on a sustained basis would be taking away the pressure that, thank goodness, is currently being applied to a number of Member States by the financial markets.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a second issue, I would point out that Europe would not be made healthy where the result of Eurobonds would be not to make the sick healthy, but to make the healthy sick. That is why we need to be honest on this issue, too. Eurobonds would not strengthen the European Union, they would weaken it.</p>
      <p sl="de">Then we have the craziest proposal of all in this resolution, namely to engineer a kind of self-funding reduction of debts through new debts via a redemption fund. What world are we living in? In real terms, what that means is that the debts that countries have run up would be refinanced thanks to the creditworthiness of others, with the costs being borne by those who kept their finances in order in that they have to pay higher interest rates for those who failed to do likewise. That is the communitarisation of debts. Anyone introducing this as a policy instrument endangers Europe much, much more than what we have currently put in place in connection with the rescue packages. I can therefore but warn against acting as if Eurobonds would enable us to solve all our problems.</p>

Nobody said that other countries should take on the debt. It was natural for Italy to pay high interest rates. Yet now, all of a sudden, because we have had low interest rates for 10 years and got up to our ears in debt, because money was cheap – for investments just as for the public purse – we want to prolong that through Eurobonds.

The issuance of common bonds, which some consider a ‘potentially powerful tool to address liquidity constraints in several euro area Member States’ would, in my opinion, only draw attention away from the acute and unresolved fiscal discipline problems.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The crisis requires implementation of, and strict adherence to, an adequate fiscal framework, and the concurrent revival of economic growth. The common continuation of public indebtedness would only deepen the current negative situation. Although some negative effects would be delayed and masked in the short term, the core problem, however, would remain unchanged. The introduction of commonly issued stability bonds would also radically change the structure of the euro area sovereign bond market and would introduce new and as yet little scrutinised risks for Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Finally, I would like to say that now, while there is unrest in Athens, the European Parliament is obsessed with the idea of Eurobonds. I think that priority should be given to employment, growth and the creation of jobs.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, now that common economic governance has been established, keeping it stable is clearly a goal for all Member States, and I therefore support both the motion for a resolution and the introduction of stability bonds. So much is certain. From this point on, however, all I have for the Commissioner is questions – both in respect of the introduction of the system and the Member States intending to join. Commissioner, you gave a general introduction, for which I am very thankful to you. I understand that you are in an extremely difficult position having to stand in for Commissioner Rehn; however, I cannot look past the fact that this issue has gone far beyond the point where a general introduction is needed. At this point we should be discussing the specifics. The green paper contains two important elements in respect of the introduction of these bonds: budgetary discipline and the matter of increasing competitiveness. Are there any other requirements for issuing such bonds? It is also unclear how Member States that are not part of the euro area will be able to join. A roadmap – a specific one, not a general one – would be welcome. I would appreciate your response in this matter.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I am not a financier, I just want to employ some common sense. I would like to ask a question: do any of the proponents of stability bonds recall what the cause of the mortgage crisis was in the US? Financial institutions created packages for investors which included mortgages of varying quality. These collateral bonds were supposed to spread risk in the event of a default on mortgage payments. They came about as a result of a political order in the shape of an endeavour to provide every citizen with a loan for a house, regardless of financial capabilities.</p>
      <p sl="sk">This is no different to what we now call stability bonds. It is a political endeavour to make more loans accessible to those who cannot repay them. Even the strictest financial discipline rules will fail if they are not enforceable. In the case of mortgages, the lender can claw back part of the loan by selling the property. In national sovereign debts this option does not exist. I believe that the risks associated with Eurobonds have not been sufficiently taken into account.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the euphemistic way ‘Eurobonds’ are being called stability bonds is founded upon a prerequisite that we reject: the deepening of economic and budgetary governance will result in a marked transfer of sovereignty to the major powers. The strategic objective adopted here is not economic growth, job creation and combating social inequality, but the establishment of the euro as a global reserve currency, an element which goes against the interests of the people of the outlying countries. This mechanism does not guarantee the end of speculative attacks and retains differentiation in the interest rates each country pays for finance. There is no need for measures that could, years ago and in the framework of debating a profound change in European Union economic policy, have served to dampen speculative shock. What is required at this time is to reverse the path taken and repeal economic governance, the Euro Plus Pact and the fiscal compact.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, according to the Commission’s annual analysis for 2012, economic recovery in the EU is going through a period of stagnation, and economic growth is forecast this year to reach only 0.6%. The deepening of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area is worrying. In view of this, common bonds could provide an effective tool for resolving liquidity problems. They mark a step forward towards common fiscal sovereignty between euro area Member States. Issuing stability bonds could also help provide funding at lower costs. This would have a positive impact on national markets.</p>

      <p sl="en">Vice-president of the Commission . − Madam President, this is quite an experience: 22 people are on the list to speak and there are only 5 in the Chamber. I am saying this by way of response to the remark of Honourable Member Werner Langen, who mentioned that 18 reactions to Olli Rehn’s speech was quite a low number. I could not agree more, but his reaction and his conclusion on that number was that the Commission did not do the job properly. I do not accept that conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Olli Rehn is doing a great job. He could not be here today, but I can assure you he has to be active in the solution for Greece. Having said that I think that it is quite remarkable that as I began my speech Mr Bloom was saying ‘I have to go’, ‘I am hungry’. This type of reaction is not in keeping with the importance of the issue we are dealing with.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am more than willing to do the job and to give the answers that I have available on this subject. The subject is too important not to reply in full. I completely agree and, therefore, arguments in favour of pursuing Eurobonds are clear. Stability bonds would provide all participating Member States with more secure access to refinancing, and reduce or eliminate the need for costly support and rescue measures for Member States temporarily excluded from market financing. Stability bonds would enhance financial stability and they would provide the source of more robust collateral for all banks in the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would reduce banks’ vulnerability to any deterioration in the credit ratings of individual Member States, and other institutional investors would benefit from a more homogeneous and robust safe asset. But stability bonds are not a measure to address the current crisis. They are the next step in EU integration and a tool to limit the risk of future crises. Stability bonds can make the euro-area financial system more resilient to future adverse shocks and so reinforce financial stability.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also need to be clear about legal, technical and political challenges. For example, the issuance of stability bonds under joint and several guarantees would, a priori , lead to a situation where the Article 125 ban on bail-outs would be breached. In this case, an amendment to the Treaty would be necessary. I do not need to explain to you the likelihood of success of such changes in the current circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="en">In so far as the introduction of stability bonds will increase the pooling of risk between participating countries, this might have the effect of weakening market discipline. This means that it is of crucial importance that all participating Member States have confidence in other participants’ economic and budgetary policies, and thus a higher degree of control over each other’s policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, an increase in surveillance and in intrusiveness in the design and implementation of national fiscal policies would be warranted beyond the recent initiatives, and by that I am talking about the six-pack, the fiscal compact treaty and Article 136 regulations proposed by the Commission. The very existence of stability bonds could fundamentally alter budgetary processes, notably via the allocation mechanisms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The participating Member States would collectively decide and approve individual budgetary plans through the allocation of bonds. All these issues require careful further reflection. The Commission will therefore continue seeking the views of key stakeholders in this respect and will therefore consult, in particular, Member States, financial market operators, financial market industry associations and academics within the EU and beyond. Once sufficient clarity has been established on all those issues, the Commission will give its views on the appropriate way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">I sincerely hope that those who remain in the Chamber and who are interested in the debate can accept this response in the name of Olli Rehn.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that the risks facing Member States on the financial markets need to be pooled. In a situation where France is facing the threat of having its rating downgraded by credit rating agencies and Germany was faced a few months ago with increased problems in financing itself, refusing to implement Eurobonds will clearly only exacerbate the current situation for all EU Member States. Creating a single Eurobond market, while also setting targets for reducing Member States’ debts under the supervision of the European executive, would help make the euro more stable, increase liquidity and achieve significantly lower interest rates. A single currency cannot operate without a common bond market and a common fiscal policy. In fact, the euro has the potential required to become a global reserve currency. Against this background, I welcome the initial proposal from the European Commission on stability bonds. Following consultations, it must quickly present a road map for launching this tool.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Green Paper on the feasibility of introducing stability bonds assesses the feasibility of the common issuance of sovereign bonds among euro area Member States and the conditions required. Sovereign issuance in the euro area is currently conducted by Member States on a decentralised basis, using various issuance procedures. The introduction of commonly issued stability bonds would mean a pooling of sovereign issuance among the Member States and a sharing of associated revenue flows and debt-servicing costs. This would significantly alter the structure of the euro area sovereign bond market, which is the largest segment in the euro area financial market as a whole. The intensification of the euro-area sovereign debt crisis has triggered a wider debate on the feasibility of common issuance. A significant number of political figures, market analysts and academics have promoted the idea of common issuance as a potentially powerful instrument to address liquidity constraints in several euro area Member States. The common issuance of Stability Bonds would also require a further move towards a common economic and fiscal policy. The Commission should declare the preliminary results of the consultations on stability bonds mentioned in the Green Paper, and on the further steps it plans to take based on the public consultation on its Green Paper. I am personally of the firm opinion that the introduction of common bonds is one of the key points in combating the current crisis. I therefore hope that decisive steps will be taken in this direction.</p>

      <p sl="de">Instead of helping Greece from the start by having it exit the euro and achieve rapid consolidation through a European Marshall Plan, a vicious circle of debt, recession and hunger for credit was created, attempting to relegate Greece to the status of a permanent recipient of financial aid. Many before have lost house and home playing that game. At EU level there is much more at stake. Here, whole states and the debt burden of future generations are on the line. Yet, while casinos have the ability to bar people, Brussels wants to open the doors wider to gambling addicts. Eurobonds are nothing more than a public invitation to raise fiscal policy sloppiness and the communitarisation of debt to a new level. Of course, the bankrupt states in the euro would rather tap the financial power of the net contributor states – thus in particular Germany, the Netherlands and Austria – than to bring their own budgets into order. When, in the casino of European sovereign debts, the alarm is ringing, it is not acceptable that we should then simply use Eurobonds to switch off the flashing lights and allow the crisis-hit countries to assume even more debts than they could ever repay. The further communitarisation of debts through Eurobonds must be vigorously rejected. Instead, the EU should take new paths such as a European hard currency union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I would like to thank the Commission for giving tangible shape to the debate on Eurobonds; the Green Paper on stability bonds is an excellent start to that debate. The idea of common euro area bonds must be properly examined as one component in the Union’s future financial architecture, especially as a method for increasing the stability of European public debt financing and to reduce interest charges, and as a boost to the economy. The approach should, above all, be a pragmatic one: with adequate guarantees of good financial discipline, a common bond would reduce everyone’s debt service costs. Without them, we would be sharing the risks for the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Common European bonds will also be seen to bring other benefits. Lower and steadier interest rates on the debts of countries in the system and making it harder to speculate using the bonds of individual countries are issues we hear time and time again in debates. The argument that common bonds have greater liquidity has, in particular, been used to support the idea that the system would also be useful for ‘good payers’, which would still be countries judged to be in the lowest possible risk category. It is mainly the smaller countries with AAA credit ratings, though also Germany, which have been thought to benefit from a large, more liquid bond market. Common bonds would compel Member States to coordinate their financial policies more closely.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Both those who oppose the system and they who support it have valid reasons for so doing. I myself think that the benefits to be gained from Eurobonds will, in the end, be greater, as long as we ensure that the system’s rules and structure are imposed in the right way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, through the decision on European radio spectrum policy we are taking necessary and crucial steps to regain European global leadership regarding mobile telephones, with all the opportunities that provides for the European telecoms industry as well as for new services and new jobs and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important to underline that this is what this decision is about: not only telecoms but also giving new dynamism to the European economy. I would like to thank the Commissioner, the Hungarian and Polish Presidencies and the shadow rapporteurs for the results.</p>
      <p sl="en">For quite a long time, Europe had the leadership in mobile telecoms. It was a common European GSM standard together with European deregulation that paved the way for a dynamic European telecoms industry with new innovations, where new technolgies created growth and prosperity. We have lost that momentum and we can today see a new global economy with new actors – China, India – competing together with us and the US. We need to make the necessary efforts to lead new development not only because of the telecoms industry as such, but also because of the need to recover competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we have seen the demand for mobile data traffic really explode, and it will continue to increase extremely rapidly, with all the opportunities for new services. My ambition in the report on this decision was that, within a multi-annual spectrum programme, we should try to take the lead regarding this second wave of internet revolution which we are facing. I want us to lead the process of change and I want us to create the best opportunities in Europe regarding competitiveness and the use of telecoms opportunities.</p>
      <p sl="en">To phrase it very simply: I want Europe to be number one, not number two, not number three and not number four. However, if we are to be number one, we must take the decisions which can make us number one. I am therefore very glad that we have been able to raise our ambitions in this process. Thanks to this decision we will free up the 800 MHz band from January 2013, which will provide European telecoms industries and new services with the capacity which is needed. With this decision we set the target of freeing up, no later than 2015, a total of 1 200 MHz for wireless services, which will assure that we can meet the increasing demands and be in the lead for quite a long time, offering the best possible capacities for European industries, be it the service sector or the telecoms industry as such.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have also agreed that in 2015 the Commission will assess the need for a further freeing-up of frequencies in order to secure that we have the best opportunities. We have decided that we shall create a European inventory and assure that we have all the necessary opportunities for wi-fi in other areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, all in all, Madam President, what we have before us is a decision which will provide us with opportunities not only to achieve leadership in telecoms but also to increase competitiveness and opportunities for new services. I thank you all for your cooperation and look forward to the debate here tonight and the decision tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Vice-president of the Commission . − Madam President, I am delighted that Parliament and the Council have reached agreement on the radio spectrum policy programme. As you know, the Council confirmed this last December and I am confident that Parliament will do so tomorrow. I want in particular to praise the efforts made by the rapporteur. For me it is ‘Spectrum Gunnar’ – not ‘Speedy Gonzalez’, but ‘Spectrum Gunnar’. Mr Hökmark and the shadow rapporteurs were of great help, and the Chair was also of great help in achieving this result.</p>
      <p sl="en">Adopting this programme is a significant step forward. We know the importance of spectrum for the digital world. For instance, mobile data usage in Europe is almost doubling every year – driven by a rocketing smartphone market and increasing demand for online audiovisual content. In that world, constraints on spectrum availability are constraints on economic growth, as has rightly been said, and would make it harder to reach our target of broadband for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">This programme opens the door for significant achievements in the coming years. First, by 2013, we will open the key 800 MHz band for next generation wireless communications. Second, we will create a European inventory to support efficient spectrum use, using it to identify by 2015 at least 1 200 MHz of harmonised spectrum for wireless broadband. Third, we will guarantee competition in the use of spectrum. Fourth, we will meet the need for spectrum in sectors like transport, energy, the environment, earth observation, civil protection and the internet of things. Fifth, we will support Member States and enhance EU coordination in international spectrum negotiations. The 2012 World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC) in Geneva, which is going on as I speak, is a good example. I would remind you that, without affecting the compromise, the Commission has attached three statements to the Council minutes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me now briefly update you on the ongoing negotiations in Geneva. Clearly I cannot give you a full assessment until after proceedings are complete, later this week. That full assessment will be covered in a staff working paper to be presented to you very soon. However, at this stage it seems probable that the EU’s objectives, as highlighted in particular in Parliament’s resolution of last September, should broadly be achieved, particularly those on the need for more broadband spectrum, on protecting Galileo, and on short-range devices.</p>
      <p sl="en">A new issue also arose during the WRC negotiations relating to the possible use of the 700 MHz band for wireless broadband, based on a proposal by African and Arab countries which did not want to wait until 2015 to have a discussion on this subject. This is obviously a sensitive issue, but the programme discussed today gives us the policy line and tools to deal with it.</p>
      <p sl="en">Remember, tomorrow’s economy will be digital. A coherent spectrum programme provides the rails on which that economy will run. To ensure significant success, I invite the honourable Members of this Parliament to approve the Council’s position, in line with the compromise reached on 24 October 2011.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that it is very important for all of us specifically now, when we consider the debt crisis, to also think about how we will earn back the money that we are spending. We said that we would judge you on the results by 2014, how you manage to bring about the basic conditions, here in this most important of the European Union’s areas of responsibility, that will make us more competitive. You have my congratulations, as the hardware has improved dramatically across the globe in recent months and years, from smartphones to the iPad, from the copper plate to the fibreglass high-speed networks that offer quite a dramatic difference in capacity for surfing the net, to cloud computing, where we can see that demand is rising at extreme levels and that we, here in the European Union, have taken a pioneering role. You have my congratulations for that.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ultimately it is about setting new standards, including in the field of software. If we talk of network neutrality today, what matters is the quality, the quantity, the priority and the performance with which work is performed in these networks. To achieve that, we need technical standardisation, as well as technical legislation. Europe has shown that, with software solutions and technical standards, great progress can be achieved. If, for example, we just take the GSM system: UMTS, LTE, the fourth generation networks – what will be next? We should be prepared for extreme growth in data volumes. I therefore also proposed in Roaming Dossier 3 that we should measure wholesale trade in terabytes rather than gigabytes – a level that consumers have already reached.</p>
      <p sl="de">When it comes to content, too, there are numerous disagreements. If we take the debate on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), we can see that lifelong learning is also key for the user and that we need to do more research in this area. In other words, the business models that arise here, the emergency services and the social networks all have a claim for the frequencies to be found to enable them to do their work.</p>

      <p sl="es">I know this has not been easy, as distribution was traditionally the prerogative of the Member States and I can imagine how difficult it must have been to bring the Council to the negotiating table.</p>
      <p sl="es">The demand for wireless services that require spectrum is currently on the increase, and spectrum is limited. Therefore, we must make sure it is efficiently allocated in such a way that access is guaranteed to the most innovative services.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament welcomes the key points of the agreement. Some of them have just been mentioned by Commissioner Kroes: the allocation of the 800 MHz band to broadband Internet services in all the Member States by 2013; the obligation to assign at least 1 200 MHz to mobile data traffic by 2015; and the creation of an inventory of existing spectrum use, which will serve to explore new opportunities for harmonisation and more efficient use.</p>
      <p sl="es">These measures will enable new spectrum uses and help to bridge the digital divide. They constitute an advancement towards the goal of ensuring the entire population can have access to high-speed Internet, as established in the Digital Agenda.</p>
      <p sl="es">Lastly, I would simply like to point out that my group has stressed that we need to strike a balance between the demand of telecommunication operators and the need for broadcasters to maintain their frequencies. Our goal has always been to ensure cultural diversity.</p>
      <p sl="es">In short, the primary aims of this agreement are to reduce the digital divide and to give telecommunications operators guarantees so that they may invest in an industry that has outstanding potential and thus contribute to Europe’s economic recovery.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report which, although complex, is of crucial importance to all of us. This proposal marked the Commission’s first pan-European programme involving the strategic planning and harmonisation of radio spectrum usage within the EU. The main objective of the programme is to increase the number of frequencies available for wireless broadband communication. The scope of the programme within the sphere of digital technologies is to grant access to broadband services to all EU citizens by 2020. However, the harmonisation of the frequency bands is not just a technological improvement for the EU. It is actually a key component for achieving a single market throughout Europe. By expanding the single market to include frequency bands, the EU will offer a digital environment that enables the development of a single internal market and strengthens various aspects of our economy. This harmonisation will encourage pan-European services and reduce the administrative burden for the individual Member States. Only then will the EU be able to assume a leading role as well within the services sector and in the development of a competitive knowledge-based economy. The facts show that the level of worldwide data transfer through mobile networks will double every year until 2014. This is why it is imperative to free up more radio spectrum for wireless broadband communications. However, very prompt action is of the essence.</p>

      <p sl="en">Spectrum is a finite resource often hoarded by public sectors. Countries should liberalise the existing 3G spectrum for the next generation and allow spectrum to be traded, giving access to new entrants. Releasing spectrum is vital for economic growth.

I, therefore, think that we should not slow down the work carried out on the second reading of the radio spectrum policy programme. The Polish Presidency made every effort to ensure implementation of the RSPP within the shortest timeframe, all the more so, since both the Commission and the Council favour the adoption of the document in its current form.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The agreement that was reached through compromise - for example, the freeing up of the 800 MHz band for wireless broadband Internet services in all Member States by 1 January 2013, the increase of mobile communication to at least 30 Mbps by 2020, and the allocation of at least 1200 MHz of the spectrum to mobile data traffic by 2015, as well as the creation of an inventory with a very large scope of the existing use of spectrum from 400 MHz to 6 GHz - will pave the way for the European Union to take the global lead in wireless broadband communications services.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The programme’s priority is to create a framework for the radio spectrum, which could help the European Union in reaching its key objective of access to high-speed Internet for all EU citizens. We should, therefore, remember that the effective use of data transfer by citizens and businesses is a challenge, but also an unquestionable step towards improved standards of education and work, and thus a guarantee of the development potential of future generations of Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the Commission’s proposal for a decision from September 2010 establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme sets out policy guidelines and objectives for the strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of radio spectrum until 2015. The radio spectrum policy programme reflects how important the availability and effective use of the spectrum is to the internal electronic communications market and to other European Union policy areas such as transport, research, Earth observation, satellite-based navigation systems, environmental protection and tackling global warming.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome that the amendments proposed, which were adopted by Parliament, were also included in the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament. They aim to include the following goals as part of the policy objectives:</p>
      <p sl="ro">1. In Article 3(c), removing the digital divide and contributing to the objectives of the Digital Agenda, thereby ensuring that all EU citizens have access to broadband of at least 30 Mbps by 2020 and allowing the EU to have the highest speed and capacity possible for broadband services;</p>
      <p sl="ro">2. In Article 3(l), promoting the accessibility of the new consumer products and technologies so as to secure consumer endorsement for the transition to digital technology and efficient use of the digital dividend.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I also welcome the inclusion in Article 4(3) of the need to focus particular attention on the standards for equipment intended to be used by people with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The decision envisages an inventory being carried out of the current use of radio spectrum for commercial and public purposes. The inventory will be administered by the Commission which will adopt the implementing acts by July 2013, with the aim of defining the methods and formats for collecting and transmitting data to Member States. The Commission will submit a report to the Council and Parliament on implementing the decision no later than two years after its entry into force and will carry out a review of its implementation by 31 December 2015.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, at times when many people are sceptical about Europe and wonder what it can concretely deliver to them, businesses, cultural and economic development, it is nice to be able to bring some good news.</p>
      <p sl="en">Radio spectrum, like any move towards a true European digital single market, is such a subject. Radio spectrum is scarce but it offers a number of opportunities and it is essential to make Europe a global leader in this information society.</p>
      <p sl="en">This political agreement will pave the way for a development that will allow the EU to take the global lead on broadband speeds, mobility coverage and capacity. It will be a crucial building block in creating a flexible and coordinated European spectrum policy where the exponential growth of mobile data traffic can be met by future reallocations and where inefficient use of spectrum belongs to the past. This policy should help to create a true pan-European telecoms market.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is unfortunate that the European Parliament was not able to achieve the extension of the allocations of unlicensed spectrum to allow for greater use of wi-fi. To preserve the European level playing field, and to take our opportunities in a highly competitive global economy, we should avoid a situation where newer and better technologies are at a disadvantage simply because they came later.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, who also so successfully put across Parliament’s position in the negotiations with the Council. ‘Spectrum Gunnar’, you have my thanks!</p>
      <p sl="de">More and more European citizens make use of mobile Internet services, and the trend is upwards. I have a couple more figures to highlight this. In 2010 alone, average monthly smartphone usage doubled to 79 MB from 35 MB the previous year. Similarly, in 2010 3 million new tablets – such as the iPad – were newly connected to the mobile network. In future, too, even greater data traffic is anticipated. Experts predict that mobile data traffic will increase by a factor of 26 between 2010 and 2015, and in 2015 some 788 million people will use the Internet exclusively from mobile devices.</p>
      <p sl="de">Against this backdrop, the first European radio spectrum policy programme, which we will be deciding on tomorrow, therefore has a particular role to play. Our goal is clear – more frequencies need to be made available for wireless broadband networks in future than has been the case so far. The flood of data was threatening to block up the transmission capacities that we have hitherto had available. More frequencies will mean that we can continue to use our mobile Internet services without interruption in future. If we adopt the radio spectrum policy programme tomorrow with a broad majority, we will have done something positive for our citizens in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">As you all know, I am currently also fighting on another front, as rapporteur for the new Roaming Regulation, to bring about better conditions for mobile Internet use. I believe that surfing the net when abroad must become much cheaper. Commissioner, you have already brought forward a bold proposal in this regard. We also aim to be somewhat bolder in Parliament, as we want to achieve something for our European consumers. If the Roaming Dossier – as is my hope – can be wrapped up in the first half of this year I would be very pleased if I earned the nickname ‘Roaming Angelika’.</p>

      <p sl="it">Europe is behind. The United States and China have already liberalised most of their radio spectrum. Therefore the agreement to open up the 800 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband Internet services by the end of the year, and to speed up mobile broadband to at least 30 Mbps is to be welcomed. These are important objectives.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that a European digital agenda could be a source of development, growth and unemployment. We have to act decisively in order to reclaim our leading role in the global knowledge economy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to bring a little reality to the illusion that has just been so elegantly produced because, from a culture and media policy point of view, the Council’s Common Position is, in fact, a disappointment and unsatisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="de">Frequencies are a scarce public good with considerable cultural and media policy significance. As long as, for example, radio needs frequencies to broadcast its services, these are of particular importance for the freedom of the media and of expression in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Committee on Culture and Education has put forward a series of proposals for how this can reasonably be taken into consideration. Alongside clear wordings on the special role of radio and the consideration that it needs to be given, we warned that we need to open the door now to the second digital dividend.</p>
      <p sl="de">We called for clear compensation rules so that it is clarified that switchover-related costs, for example for the new procurement of technology in theatres, will be assumed and that provision must be made for compensation for investments that made the digital dividend possible.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is nothing left of all this, apart from the brief reference to the Telecoms Package and a few permissive provisions for the Member States. I now expect the Commission and the Member States to at least demonstrate in their practical actions that they are aware of their responsibilities, that their dealings with this public good will not be solely in pursuit of economic benefit and that they are aware of its importance for media diversity and for the cultural interests of our society.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Hökmark, for his excellent work on the radio spectrum policy programme. Radio spectrum is limited and a natural resource that is very much in demand. It is needed in numerous sectors and, increasingly, for digital technology and fast broadband connections in particular.</p>
      <p sl="fi">On the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I myself was responsible for this programme’s framework, and I am very pleased that we produced what was considered to be an ambitious, forward-looking text. There is a need for more spectrum to meet the challenges of the digital agenda with regard to fast connections that also extend to remote areas, and to make smart phones cheaper and their increased use viable.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The policy programme to be voted on tomorrow attaches great importance to the need to make the 800 MHz band available for mobile services in all EU countries, as from January 2012. This deadline was a major achievement, because certain countries wanted to delay the process by several years.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This is, therefore, an ambitious achievement, which will enable new services provided by the telecommunications market to develop and grow quickly.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, Europe needs a flexible, coordinated radio spectrum policy. It will help create a pan-European telecommunications market. Radio spectrum is vital to the digital society. It is important that the EU assumes its role of global leader in terms of speeds, mobility, coverage and broadband connection capacity. The digital divide must be eliminated. The feasibility of extending the allocations of unlicensed spectrum for wireless access systems must be assessed.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This technology must be accessible in rural areas, as well as urban areas. I should also highlight the measures for protecting against electromagnetic fields. However, the use of radio spectrum must not endanger citizens’ health. This is why it is vital that the impact of spectrum usage is permanently monitored.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, as it is a finite resource, the way in which we use radio spectrum is extremely important if we want to maximise the benefits for end consumers and private operators.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agreement recently reached by the European Parliament and the Council vindicates the decision made by Europe’s institutions to take the initiative globally in this technology sector. Providing Internet access across the whole EU, establishing high-speed connections and standardising the frequency for electronic communications at 800 MHz may help reduce the digital divide at a time when studies indicate that data traffic is continuing to grow globally.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Taking this aspect into account, the benefit of standardising other frequency bands must be analysed. EU-level regulation and harmonisation of the rules on spectrum allocation will provide the basis for innovation and increased competition, which will help us meet the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, there is competition for the low and very high frequencies of the radio spectrum, which are being filled for multiple purposes: electricity distribution and consumption, telecommunications, geodesy, and navigation, and security. However, we have some concerns about this subject. We would like to know the Commission’s opinion. We note that there is no space on the spectrum for public access, as it has all been allocated or reserved for commercial purposes, with the only exceptions being strictly for security, defence and the emergency services.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know it is the objective of this directive to pave the way for telecommunications, media and consumer industries, but we think that part of the spectrum should be reserved for public purposes, which certainly have a role to play other than that of the market.

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in 2010, the European Commission presented a proposal for a multi-annual radio spectrum policy programme under Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and associated measures. In May 2011, the European Parliament proposed several changes aimed at opening up new possibilities for allocating a radio spectrum suitable for fast wireless broadband communications. Although not all of the European Parliament's requests met with understanding and support from the European Council, it has been possible, through a joint effort, to lay strong foundations for a new European radio spectrum policy.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The fact that the 800 MHz frequency band will be freed up for wireless broadband internet services from 2013, and a 1200 MHz spectrum for mobile data transfer will be added from 2015, will allow the European Union to rapidly develop broadband connections and the European telecommunications market with its 500 million consumers. We can only hope that the new spectrum allocation contained in this agreement will actually deliver the expected improvement in the speed and quality of data communications in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Vice-president of the Commission . − Madam President, there are a couple of intriguing questions. One specific point was made by Marietje Schaake and by Ms Băsescu, talking about an unlicensed spectrum for wi-fi. This is very important, there is no doubt about that, and we will examine that. That is also linked to the point that was touched upon by Ms Zuber: indeed, public access will be part of the inventory, as it were. It is not all about licensed and commercial users.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final conclusion so far is that I am pleased to note – I hope I may be so bold as to say this – that all the Members agree on the absolute importance of increased access to spectrum as a means to provide growth and give a push to jobs. It is very important that we all agree on that issue: that the role of radio spectrum boosts growth in Europe and provides real and tangible benefits for European consumers; and that the radio spectrum programme to be adopted by Parliament tomorrow will not only give a good feeling after all the hard work by Parliament, Council and the Commission, but is indeed one of those tokens whereby we can prove to the outside world that there are positive messages too.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to thank all of you for your constructive collaboration and work during the whole procedure. Time flies, a lot of blood, sweat and tears have been shed, but in the end only the result counts. I think that a wonderful job has been done by all of you.</p>

I think it is fair to say that media and culture will have more opportunities than ever to reach the audience, as we see is happening just now.</p>
      <p sl="en">Things are changing, and I think the most important lesson to learn from this debate is that the enormous, rapid development we have seen in the past decade will be just as rapid and surprising in the coming decade. It is important for us to secure the full capacity to take advantage of all this, for media and culture as well as for new services.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I think it is also important, regarding the next steps, to secure the rapid implementation of this legislation, but at the same time to prepare for the next steps, because we have only seen the beginning of a new development, of a second wave of Internet revolution. This will have its consequences and opportunities, as we have seen in the demonstrations in Northern Africa, and as we have seen in the revolution in different parts of our economies. The faster we are, the more use we can make of the next steps.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have decided to set the target of 1200 MHz; that is for 2015. After that we should assess the needs and proceed rapidly in the next few years, because the future is coming closer and closer and we need to be in the lead. In order to be in the lead, we need to take the lead, and proceed by being the first to open up new opportunities all the time, because they are unlimited while the resource, the spectrum, is limited.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The expansion of the digital single market has recently been an increasingly frequent topic of discussion for us, in view of the trend towards digitisation and the maturing of Europeans’ consumer habits. The demand for mobile data services has doubled recently, which is a continuing upward trend. As the Commissioner has also emphasised, European consumers are constantly increasing the amount of audiovisual content they use on their mobile terminals. To achieve this, better-performance broadband mobile services are required, which also means, of course, sufficient radio spectrum. This is why radio spectrum policy is an extremely important tool for being able to respond to this demand and develop the digital single market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Releasing the 800 MHz band and making it available for electronic communications services will remove the technical constraints on developing new mobile data services. Allocating a minimum of 1 200 MHz for mobile data services by 2015 is another positive measure in this respect. I think that the agreement we are going to vote on tomorrow will bring us closer to the objectives of the Digital Agenda and help boost the EU’s competitiveness, a development which I will wholeheartedly endorse.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The legislative package put forward by Mr Hökmark is an important step towards strengthening the competitiveness of the European Union. I am pleased to note that besides economic crisis management, increasing attention is finally being paid to long-term competitiveness. According to the adopted proposal, freeing up the 800 MHz frequency band from 2013 will facilitate the creation of a pan-European telecommunications market and will provide the capacity for new services to be made available to users. Upon the request of the European Parliament the proposal foresees freeing up 1200 MHz to mobile data traffic by 2015. Frequency allocation falls within the scope of Member State competence, but determining the rules of spectrum management is the responsibility of the European Union. It is good news for consumers that the frequency bands freed up for broadband mobile Internet services contribute to the achievement of the 30 Mbps minimum target under the Digital Agenda by 2020, ensuring high download speeds even for citizens living in remote regions. Allow me to highlight the role of the Hungarian Presidency in the drafting of the proposal, as the political agreement on efficient frequency management was concluded during Hungary’s six-month term. With the successful closing of the dossier an increasingly large portion of society will be able to enjoy the benefits of the Internet, which will entail economic growth and the strengthening of Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
