      <p sl="unknown">The first item is the report by Mr Cutaş, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 2009 annual report of the European Investment Bank (2010/2248/INI) (A7-0073/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-008-000" speaker_id="96856" name="George Sabin Cutaş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the presentation of this report on the activities carried out by the European Investment Bank is part of an annual democratic exercise which comes under the responsibility the Bank has to the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although this exercise is carried out on a regular basis, it must not be trivialised as it includes recommendations on important matters for the future of the European Union. Once the Treaty of Lisbon came into force in December 2009, the European Investment Bank became an instrument for supporting the European Union’s external policies, while also acting as an important partner for driving the Union’s economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I would like to thank my fellow Members for the improvements they have made to the report. I would also like to thank the entire bank’s staff for their excellent cooperation, especially President Maystadt and Vice-President Kolatz-Ahnen.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We are all looking for a method of reconciling Member States’ growing debts and deficits with economic growth targets set out, for example, in the EU 2020 strategy, which require major investments in education, health, technology, sustainable energy and infrastructure. I think that the solution to this problem is a European one, with the European Investment Bank having an important role to play in this situation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I will present here two significant examples of the way in which the European Investment Bank has boosted and will continue to boost the European economy. Firstly, there are the loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and then, project bonds. We must not forget that 99% of European businesses are small and medium-sized enterprises. Investing in SMEs is a means of making a significant contribution to the innovation, research and development activities taking place in the European Union. The European Investment Bank offered small and medium-sized enterprises funding above its annual target of EUR 7.5 billion in 2009 and 2010.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The European Microfinance Facility was also created in 2010, pooling funds amounting to EUR 200 million, assigned to those who need micro-credits. However, we notice that difficulties persist at the point where entrepreneurs access the funds.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that we need to enhance the transparency of the procedures used to select the Bank’s financial intermediaries and for providing loans to them. It is also the European Investment Bank’s duty to offer technical assistance and cofinancing to the convergence regions in order to allow them to absorb the funds available to them at a higher rate.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Another subject which I want to touch on is project bonds. Are we entitled to place such great hopes on this financial instrument? I think that we are. Its purpose is to increase the credit ratings of the bonds issued by companies, by attracting private investments, so as to supplement domestic investments and those made via the cohesion funds. Thanks to this multiplier effect, the companies will obtain more money for implementing infrastructure projects in the areas of transport, energy, IT and sustainable development. It is important to focus on certain key projects, such as sustainable development, the road and rail infrastructure, and connecting ports to European markets and those which will allow energy independence, like the Nabucco gas pipeline or the ITGI project.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As we are discussing today possible solutions for exiting the financial crisis, this brings us to the subject of transparency and tax havens. The lack of transparency from financial intermediaries has taken the specific form of tax evasion and fraud and has contributed to the tough situation we are currently faced with.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is the duty of the European Investment Bank, as a European bank, not to get involved in operations carried out through non-cooperative jurisdictions, as identified at the moment by various international bodies. At the same time, these lists are still not enough. The European Investment Bank can make its contribution in this area by carrying out proper assessments and publishing its results on a regular basis.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I would like to mention the role played by the Bank outside the European Union, in countries en route to joining the EU and those coming under the remit of cooperation and development policies. In these countries, the European Investment Bank supports the European Union’s foreign policy objectives. This is why I think that we need to both assign more specialised staff in this area and raise the participation level of local actors in the project.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I am happy to listen to the views of those of you in the Chamber and to speak again at the end.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Philippe Maystadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the EIB">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, may I thank you for inviting me once again to take part in the debate on your report on the activities of the European Investment Bank – this is becoming a real tradition.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, in particular. He had the good sense not to look at matters only in retrospect, but provided guidelines for the future as well. This is essentially what I should like to talk to you about, if I may. You mention that our Board of Directors has devised a three-pronged approach to the European Investment Bank’s work over the next few years. We will develop our work in three areas: the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, the fight against climate change and support for EU external policy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When faced with the financial, then economic, crisis that erupted in 2008, the Member States provided a short-term response: the various national plans, which were intended initially to keep the banks afloat and then to stimulate an economic recovery. Those national plans, as you know, were supported by the European economic recovery plan, adopted by the European Council in December 2008. The EIB played its part by increasing the volume of its lending from EUR 48 billion in 2007 to EUR 79 billion in 2009, and by channelling that injection of funds into the real economy towards the areas described as a priority by the Council, in particular, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, as your rapporteur has just emphasised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, after that short-term response, which enabled us to avoid the worst, a longer-term response is now needed. That is where the Europe 2020 strategy comes in, and the critical part of that strategy is the increase in the employment rate and productivity, which must be based on what is often called the knowledge triangle: training, research and innovation. The EIB is ready to make a significant contribution to the implementation of that strategy. Back in 2010, it provided more than EUR 4 billion in finance for projects in the education sector and more than EUR 7 billion for RDI – research, development and innovation – projects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EIB intends to increase its financing in those areas and, to that end, it intends to continue to implement, together with the European Commission, joint financing instruments on the model of the RSFF – the Risk Sharing Finance Facility – for research, as instruments of that kind give the European budget leverage. With the same amount of funds, the European budget can bear a much greater volume of investment and, at the same time, these joint instruments relieve the capital constraint on the EIB. This means that, with the same amount of capital, the EIB can increase the volume of its lending.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I mentioned the RSFF, the Risk Sharing Finance Facility for research. It is a good example. At the end of 2010, with a budget contribution of some EUR 390 million and an EIB capital allocation of some EUR 700 million, we were actually able to lend more than EUR 6 billion, which financed more than EUR 16 billion of investment in research. You can therefore see the two kinds of leverage that such an instrument affords, and so it seems clear to us that the EIB’s contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy will be all the more effective because we will be able to rely on pragmatic cooperation with the Commission and with other financial institutions, too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second area: the fight against climate change and its sometimes tragic consequences. This has become a priority for the European Union, and hence also for the EIB. The Fukushima nuclear accident and the questions to which it gives rise further strengthen the need for huge investment in energy saving, renewable energies and new energy technologies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In 2010, EIB loans for projects directly contributing to a reduction in the volume of greenhouse gas emissions increased to almost EUR 20 billion, or almost 30% of our total lending. The loans for renewable energy projects accounted for EUR 6.2 billion of our total lending, and were used mainly for wind and solar power projects. The loans for energy efficiency improvement projects increased to EUR 2.3 billion in 2010. They will increase further over the next few years, as there is huge potential for energy saving, particularly in public buildings and homes in many European towns and cities. As for investment to develop urban transport, and hence to reduce pollution from individual means of transport, the EIB provided EUR 7.9 billion in loans in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, we are going to continue this effort. We are going to continue to support energy saving, energy efficiency and renewable energies, and we are also spearheading the development of a methodology – an inevitably complex one, given the technical difficulties – to evaluate more precisely the carbon footprint of all the projects that we finance. This particular effort testifies to our will to make the fight against climate change a major priority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, to conclude, the third area: no power can expect to conduct an external policy without financial support. China has learnt that. It intervenes financially throughout the world in order to support its external policy objectives. If the European Union really does want to develop an external policy that has some influence in the world, then it too must have a financial arm. If the European Union so wishes, the EIB can be that arm. That is one of the conclusions of the Camdussus report on the EIB’s external mandate. It remains to be seen whether the Member States, which are also shareholders of the EIB, will act on that recommendation and make a clear decision when preparing the financial perspective for 2014-2020.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there you have an overview of the EIB’s three-pronged approach for the years to come.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-010-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, for his very good report. I would also like to welcome Mr Maystadt to this plenary because it is very important that the Commission also congratulate him and the EIB for his continued forceful response to the effect of the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">EIB assistance was essential. The EIB helped us to address the credit shortage in the market and this was crucial, not only for the EU Member States and the candidate countries, but also for our partners around the world. The EIB was able to significantly increase its lending activity and, at the same time, to target the increase to the key growth-enhancing areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares the Parliament’s view that support for the EU cohesion policy, as well as transition to low carbon economies, are core targets for the EIB. Consequently, the Commission joined forces with the EIB Group to support convergence regimes with the joint financial instruments which we know very well – JASPERS, JEREMIE, and the new addition, ELENA – to fight climate change. Moreover, we welcome the increase in lending volume to SMEs and we agree with your call for more qualitative measures to increase the value added and transparency of the EIB Group intervention in this domain.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, an assessment of the optimal division of labour between the EIB and the EIF seems to be necessary. The huge efforts undertaken by the EIB bring into focus the importance of optimising the use of EIB capital. It is crucial to strike the right balance between higher volumes and high-risk activities which consume more capital but add more value to the EIB Group intervention.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say a couple of words on financial instruments. We believe that the use of innovative financial instruments, together with the key financial institutions such as the EIB, should be extended. Instruments using instant loans, equity and guarantees help maximise the effects of the EU budget by attracting additional funds from third parties. In addition, an increased use of joint financial instruments and risk sharing with the EU budget could have the effect of freeing capital and permitting a higher leverage of the EIB own resources and enhancing its reach. At the end of the day, this means more projects in support of a Europe 2020 strategy and better support for its goals and objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Europe 2020 Project Bond Initiative, which is currently in public consultation, is a very good example. The EU 2020 strategy calls for large-scale cross-border investment to underpin the EU 2020 flagship actions and develop smart, upgraded and fully interconnected infrastructures. The project bond initiative would support the financing of specific projects in the area of transport, energy and communications infrastructure, and potentially also in other sectors that can help lay the foundations for sustainable future growth and employment. I am glad to see your support for this initiative in your report.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the context of the preparation of the Commission’s proposals for the next multiannual financial framework, the Commission is carrying out a strategic reflection and analysis to ensure an optimised use of the new instruments, in dialogue with the EIB and other financial institutions, to benefit from their financial expertise and experience in the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to make a few remarks on the EIB’s external activities. Regarding EIB financing outside the EU, the Commission supports the increase of the ceilings proposed by Parliament under the mid-term review of the EIB external mandate, in particular a EUR 1 billion increase for the Mediterranean region. We know how important that is today. This is essential in order for the EIB to pursue its intervention at a sustained level and support the democratic transformation of our partner countries. In the same way, we also reiterate the importance for the EIB to reuse reflows from previous investment in the Mediterranean region in order to make risk capital investment in private sector SMEs in the region. Moreover, we support a progressive reinforcement of the EIB’s development capacity because these additional needs would require a gradual increase of staff resources specialised in development aspects.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the Commission’s proposal following the mid-term review of the EIB external mandate, the Commission will set up a working group to study the possible development of the EU platform for cooperation and development. The objective is to optimise the functioning of mechanisms, blending grants and loans involving the Commission, the EIB and other multilateral and bilateral institutions. The establishment of such a platform would help create synergies and foster cooperation between the EIB and other financial institutions. In this context, I would like to mention that the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission, the EIB and the EBRD was signed early in March.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011-000" speaker_id="33775" name="Jean-Pierre Audy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to applaud the attention you pay to the MEPs, Mr Maystadt, because as the President of an intergovernmental bank, you are not obliged to do so; we appreciate it. My speech will deal with security and with the communitisation of the European Investment Bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of security, Mr Maystadt, you said that you wish to become the power behind, and the financial arm of, the European Union. Yes, but with a triple A rating. Moreover, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control have been saying for years that you should be subject to prudential regulatory supervision. We propose that this supervision be carried out either by the European Central Bank, or, on the basis of a voluntary approach by the EIB, by the new European Banking Authority, with or without the involvement of one or more regulators, and we call on you, Commissioner, to make proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall conclude, Mr President, by mentioning our proposal for the European Union to become a member of the European Investment Bank, so that that intergovernmental instrument can gradually become a Community one.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would also like to speak, like President Maystadt, about the future, and would like to raise three points. First, growth and restructuring is what Europe needs and that means investment and funding of investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legitimate question today is to ask where that funding can come from. The important element of the response to this question lies with the European Investment Bank and its family of institutions. I also think that it is important to remember that in the years to come, we will have huge global competition for funding. We will have national budgets in a mood of further cuts. We will have also a banking sector with a lot of uncertainties when it resumes normal funding activities and, of course, we will have a European budget that will remain, as usual, too small to be efficient and to solve our problems. So the EIB will be absolutely essential.</p>

    <intervention id="4-013-000" speaker_id="28174" name="Thijs Berman" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, my compliments to my fellow Member, Mr Cutaş, on his excellent report on the EIB annual report for 2009. Compliments also on the overview which he gave us here.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, I would like to comment on one particular aspect, namely, the relationship between the Council and Parliament. The European Parliament is a colegislator for the external mandate of the European Investment Bank, for all of the bank’s activities outside the EU, in neighbouring countries and in developing countries. The Council, however, seems to be finding it extremely hard to take this Parliament’s proposals on the review of the external mandate seriously. To my surprise, the Council is making quite a habit of coolly dismissing all kinds of new proposals put forward by this House as ‘unacceptable’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am talking, in particular, about proposals for the EIB taking an active role when it comes to measures to tackle climate change and for a greater role for the EIB in microfinancing. Are these proposals ‘unacceptable’? Is it the Council’s job to define the scope of the topics which the European Parliament is allowed to discuss? No, the European Parliament and the Council are colegislators on an equal footing, and, together with and in close contact with the European Commission, should jointly determine the rules governing the EIB’s external activities. That calls for consultation, for joint deliberations, for compromise, for an open attitude on the part of both the legislators. It is nonsensical and counterproductive, then, to use the word ‘unacceptable’ to describe proposals which a large majority of the European Parliament believe to be important. Now, such an out-of-touch attitude on the part of the Council is what is unacceptable, if you ask me. The fact that no one from the Council is present here is absurd and illustrative of how out of touch they are.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The EIB is an essential tool for the EU’s external activities throughout the world. A public bank, a bank which can contribute to economic growth and the improvement of infrastructure with loans, is indispensable to the development of our neighbouring countries. The same applies to our relationship with developing countries. There, too, a public bank is vital. Such a bank must observe the Treaty of Lisbon and its objectives. Poverty reduction is one such objective. The European Parliament wants to lay down that role for the Bank clearly in its external mandate. I expect an open and constructive attitude on the part of the Council, which will enable us to arrive at that clarification together.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014-000" speaker_id="97137" name="Sylvie Goulard" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ALDE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Maystadt, I wanted to stress one point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When we started working on this report, there was already an obvious need for long-term investment because of what had happened in the European Union. The crisis showed that we were too short-sighted in our work, as Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa would have said. We genuinely need long-term investment, and your institution plays a major role.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everything that has happened recently – I am thinking, in particular, of the Southern Mediterranean and of the awareness, perhaps, of a number of difficulties with regard to our energy choices – is all the more reason to encourage you in your work and to support you. There will always be MEPs in this House who support the work that you do. I agree, however, with what Mr Audy said: it is also very important to move in the direction of increased supervision, as we have done for a number of institutions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What I mean is that, although I personally am in favour of project bonds and of many of the ideas that are circulating at the moment, I am very anxious to ensure that we do not rush into the solution of public-private partnerships without looking more closely at exactly how they are set up and what they will ultimately cost taxpayers and all those who are involved in them. I believe that they could be a very useful tool, but there are also funds in place in Europe at the moment – I am thinking of the Marguerite Fund and of the work of the deposit and consignment offices that have taken initiatives across borders – and I therefore wanted to argue for greater long-term investment and monitoring that are suitable for what we are trying to achieve together. I believe that that is the very least we should expect.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, we support you and we would like to see all the recent events that have taken place encourage more far-reaching, broader debate.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-015-000" speaker_id="96711" name="Pascal Canfin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, as you know, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is traditionally very attached to the EIB. We believe that it is an extremely important public policy instrument, and it is because we are very attached to it that we are also very demanding of it – the two go hand in hand.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our view of the EIB is that, ultimately, it is a bank in its own right, and as such, it is subject to bank constraints, which must be taken into account. Several of my fellow Members rightly referred to the fact that the EIB ought perhaps to take account of new constraints linked to the banking sector. At the same time, it is a truly exceptional bank, because it is indeed funded by taxpayers’ money. It is also there to do what the others are not doing, and to adopt rules that go beyond what the private sector can do.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to stress one or two points on which I feel that the EIB could do even better, even though progress has been made in recent months. The first point concerns the issue of tax havens. This is an extremely important fight not only for us, but also, I think, for a very large majority of my fellow Members in this House. The crisis showed that tax havens obscure, undermine and weaken the entire financial system and the world economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Therefore, in this report, the majority of MEPs support the idea that you should ensure an even greater degree of transparency with regard to loans that you grant to businesses and which pass through tax havens. I believe that that practice should be stopped. I am well aware that you have operational constraints on the ground, but there is a political point here, which is that, if you are the power behind Europe, you have to fight battles. If you fight battles, then I think that the battle against tax havens should be one of them.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for us, we would obviously like to go further; in other words, we would like you to attach conditions to EIB loans to businesses that are not part of the entire value chain in tax havens and which are, at the very least, on the OECD’s blacklist, which is currently being revised.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second point that we wished to raise concerns the issue of monitoring and governance. Mrs Goulard spoke about this just now. I believe that we should extend the choice, that we should increase the level of joint accountability so that the choice of projects involving taxpayers’ money is made as democratically and as transparently as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third point is about measuring the benefits of your action. You measure them in financial terms too, of course. As I was saying earlier, you are a bank in your own right, which means that you have challenges to meet in terms of the risk/reward ratio. However, you aim to provide other benefits too, and that is why public money is used. You aim to provide benefits in terms of social cohesion, in terms of the fight against poverty, in terms of environmental protection. I think that you could make still more progress in reporting, in measuring these non-financial benefits, which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy. I think that, rather than setting the financial benefits against the non-financial benefits, you should carry out as broad an assessment as possible, and not limit it to monetary and financial issues alone.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, the final point of my speech will relate to climate change. The report specifically states that you must pursue all the EU’s objectives. One of the official objectives of the European Union is to ensure an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This will not be possible if we continue to finance coal-fired power plants, which have a 40-year life span and which emit huge amounts of CO2 .</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, has Mr Canfin considered that the use of the EIB as a public policy instrument, which is what he and his party advocate, will be at the direct financial cost of EU taxpayers, and in particular British taxpayers? Has he considered this at all?</p>

    <intervention id="4-017-000" speaker_id="96711" name="Pascal Canfin" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">I have a very simple answer to that. I believe that the EIB has cost UK taxpayers a lot less than other, completely private UK banks have cost them, and I believe that the general interest, just like that of UK taxpayers, is far better served by the EIB than by other UK banks that the taxpayer has had to bail out.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Parliament has spent many hours in this Chamber discussing how to make the European Supervisory Authorities responsible for our financial services into the most transparent and accountable of organisations. The result has been to establish ESAs, which are fully scrutinised by this Parliament. However, in this new age of accountability after the financial crisis, and in the light of the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty, we need to establish comparable levels of oversight and scrutiny of existing EU institutions, including the EIB.</p>
      <p sl="en">Given how central the role of the EIB has become in financing EU Member States’ strategies and EU overseas activity, it is now time to improve the level of accountability of its activities to this Parliament. The loan book and the general banking and lending activities of the EIB need to be assessed in the same way as we would assess our commercial banks. They need to be subjected to rigorous stress testing and all financial activities need to remain on the balance sheet. When leverage or risk is employed, we should be sanctioning the risk limits, as ultimately any default means that it is the taxpayer who will pay again. It is time for this Parliament to seek a closer role in scrutinising the activities of the EIB, especially as the Bank’s role increases in developing new financial instruments.</p>

    <intervention id="4-019-000" speaker_id="96769" name="Jürgen Klute" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the core task of the European Investment Bank (EIB) is to promote the EU’s objectives through long-term financing of viable investments. This also means that the EIB is bound by the EU’s values; in other words, by social standards, transparency, high environmental standards, the development of a sustainable economy and the creation of jobs. However, we are hearing from NGOs involved in the local implementation of EIB-financed projects that it is by no means consistently ensured that these standards are met. This has already been mentioned by other speakers. The NGOs criticise the lack of transparency as regards the way in which loans are monitored across the EU and worldwide, how they are used and how they are reported on by the EIB’s financial intermediaries. To what extent is the EIB aware of these criticisms, and to what extent is the EIB actually looking into such criticisms? That is what we would like to know.</p>
      <p sl="de">From our point of view, at least some of what NGOs are calling for from the EIB is quite plausible: greater transparency as regards the granting of credit by financial intermediaries and the elaboration of clearer financing terms for financial intermediaries as well as efficiency criteria for the granting of loans. To improve transparency, NGOs further propose that environmental and financial information on EIB-financed projects be published before these are approved. In particular, EIB projects in third countries should be subjected to independent sustainability assessments in order to determine the economic, social and ecological impact of the project in question.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, there also appear to be other problems apart from transparency. Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental, social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs. Strict monitoring of the meeting of such standards ought to be a matter of course in all the EIB’s financial operations. Projects that do not meet these standards should be excluded from support.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to make a comment on the subject of energy policy. It is pleasing that the promotion of a sustainable and safe energy supply is already one of the EIB’s current objectives. In view of the disaster involving the Fukushima reactor, the promotion of forward-looking, renewable, CO2 -free and nuclear-free energy production, as well as the promotion of energy efficiency in all areas in which the EIB invests, must be given the highest priority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) has stated that in his visionary view, the EIB could become a driving force in developing countries alongside China. You have now raised some criticisms of this development cooperation. Could you be somewhat more specific on this, and what do you think of the basic idea that the EIB could well be a suitable instrument to counterbalance or complement what the Chinese are doing in developing countries?</p>

However, I have a large number of reports from NGOs that I am happy to make available. I believe that the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also familiar with these. These reports talk of how development aid is supported locally by the EIB in African and Asian countries and also make some criticisms of this. I am happy to make the reports available, but I cannot answer the question in detail right now.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I rise before the House today to mention one or two things which might perhaps be of help. I spent 35 years as an investment banker, investment manager, investment adviser and economic strategist, and I never bought a dud bank in my life. I never bought a dud bank for my clients, but over the past few years, I have had the politicians and bureaucrats put a gun to my head, as a taxpayer, and make me buy more dud banks than you could shake a stick at. These are not even British dud banks, they are foreign dud banks, and I hear today that the British taxpayer is being asked to fork out for Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="en">If I want to invest overseas, I will buy an emerging markets fund. I do not want a form of nationalised Mickey Mouse bank investing my money or that of my constituents by force. I say ‘Mickey Mouse bank’, Mr Maystadt, because all I have heard from you so far is how you are going to invest money to change the weather. I have never heard so much nonsense in my life. I do not know where you get your advice from, but statistically, the weather has not actually changed for about 15 or 16 years, so what are you going to shovel all this money into?</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not want to invest in your bank and neither do the British people. I would counsel you, if you want to keep your AAA status, to ignore the pleas of this House – full of eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives – in particular, in relation to paragraph 48 of the report. Solar panels in the land of the wildebeest, giraffe and bongo drum will lose you your AAA rating in no time at all.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is something of a reality gap when one listens to the comments just made by the British speaker and then looks at the actual developments that have taken place in recent years in the financial markets and banks in which we are supposed to invest so much trust.</p>
      <p sl="de">To get back to my specific points: the European Investment Bank (EIB) is an important instrument in three areas. I believe what Mr Klute says should form part of a strategy in the outside world. It is appalling to see how Chinese investors, state investors, are increasingly undermining political systems on the grounds that they are involved in a couple of local bridge building projects. When one looks for the contribution of the European Union, there is practically nothing to be found. I think you should continue on this path.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns small and medium-sized enterprises, which are being wantonly neglected by the traditional banks that are oriented solely towards maximising profits.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thirdly, there is the change in energy policy. While the disaster involving the Japanese reactor is indeed a tragedy, it could provide a following wind for you to do something in this respect here in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, after the remarks that I have just heard, which are unworthy of this House, I should like to tell you that the majority of us believe that the EIB’s action is very positive. The improvements made by the Treaty of Lisbon provide new scope for action, which should help the EIB to become even more effective and to provide relevant solutions to the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you emphasised, the EIB provides real support to small and medium-sized enterprises and makes a crucial contribution to the EU’s cohesion policy convergence objective. Those actions must be pursued and, if possible, increased.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The EIB must do more to promote strategic investments in Europe, and so I should like to invite you to support those who have taken initiatives to improve long-term financing and, in particular, deposit and consignment offices − the caisse des dépôts and cassa dei depositi − and KfW. I believe that they should be supported, because the banking regulations and accounting regulations that are developed today do not encourage us to factor in long-term investment and penalise those who opt for it. Moreover, contrary to what is often said, we need changes and not just adaptations. Long-term financing is, as you also said, essential in order to open up a new horizon for Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Outside the European Union, you are right to say that the EIB must act as a driving force and hence must propose initiatives, in particular, for the financing of the Mediterranean countries. In the current turbulent conditions affecting a good many of those countries, the EIB can make a useful contribution to economic development within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean through its targeted financing, and can thus help to establish democratic civilisation in those countries whose future is still uncertain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have noted your willingness to make that contribution if the Union asks you to do so, which I hope it will.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Cutaş for his excellent report.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Investment Bank needs to deliver more, better, faster results. The importance of its role in funding projects across all sectors of the economy in the interests of the European Union has been even further amplified by the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">The crisis has made it difficult to access credit, and it has also highlighted the need for a thorough rethinking of our economic model. The EIB has a critical role to play. To fulfil this role, it must maintain a high level of solvency and a financial position strong enough to enable it to access funding in capital markets on favourable terms. It must also have instruments available to allow necessary projects to be undertaken which would otherwise gain no financial backing from commercial banks, and which would find it very difficult to obtain funding on favourable terms elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="es">The EIB achieved some positive results in 2009, when its activity increased by 40%, its funding for small and medium-sized enterprises increased by 55%, its funding for less-developed regions increased by 36%, and its funding aimed at combating climate change and promoting energy efficiency increased by 73%</p>
      <p sl="es">However, there is much to be done and accomplishment of the European Union’s strategic objectives still requires sustainable, long-term funding. The availability of such funding has diminished as a result of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore need to promote Eurobonds. We need to introduce new instruments and new developments in the field of financial engineering, and we also need to create a common platform to include other international financial institutions. This must also be accompanied by an improvement in the EIB’s own governance and a review of its internal mandate. In short, the EIB should be a bridge effectively linking investment to the needs of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report on the activity of the European Investment Bank (EIB) highlights some important and welcome points. The first of these is the need to focus our efforts more and more on making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to have access to credit. I also welcome the reference to the project bond initiative, which I believe is a useful tool for growth and development in a sector as strategic as that of infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am somewhat puzzled by the reference to the EIB’s external activities, for which more financial and human resources are being requested. The EIB report for 2009 indicates the countries benefiting from such loans, and I note with disappointment that Turkey receives the lion’s share with almost a third of the total granted to all non-EU states. This figure is also just over a quarter of the amount granted to Italy, one of the main EIB shareholders. Italy itself is also in need of substantial loans and grants. I therefore consider this to be an absurd imbalance. I believe it is unacceptable that vast resources should be granted to a country like Turkey, which is outside the EU and, in my view, should always remain so.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Mr President, I would first like to say that such a short, precise and clear report on the matter in question is a rare sight in this Parliament. The European Investment Bank undoubtedly plays a fundamental and very important role in Europe’s development. However, I would like to make a few comments on the report and about what was said in this Chamber.</p>
      <p sl="bg">First of all, I support, from an internal perspective, the European Investment Bank’s policy for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. I think that this issue is much more important for Europe than climate change. This is where the bank needs to focus its efforts, and not so much on the development of green technologies. Though, this area will also be developed if small and medium-sized enterprises are supported.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Apart from this, from an internal perspective, I also agree with the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control on possible supervision by the European Banking Authority, which is the new body responsible for taking such actions.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Finally, the data which Mr Morganti just quoted is extremely alarming. I agree, too, with the view expressed that, especially in the case of foreign investments, it is appropriate also to have parliamentary control because it is unacceptable for external countries to receive more European funds than European countries receive themselves.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree fully with Mr Gauzès. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has always played a significant and key role in the development of the European Union. Its role and activity are even more important at a time of crisis such as the present.</p>
      <p sl="it">Recent reforms in economic governance linked to the effects of the crisis could lead to less funding being set aside by Member States for important projects such as the creation of infrastructures of strategic importance for the development of the Union as a whole. One example is the TEN-T rail transport project.</p>
      <p sl="it">I agree with the European Commission’s project bond initiative. Project bonds represent an excellent solution for sourcing finance and underpinning the infrastructure Europe needs in order to modernise and to fully exploit the potential of the internal market. The EIB’s role in issuing and managing these bonds is therefore crucial.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report presses for an increase in funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, and I agree that the EIB’s activity must be focused and results-oriented. Mr President, allow me to say that some critical issues have emerged in relation to the Bank’s activity. In particular, I would like to point out that many small and medium-sized enterprises are often unable to take advantage of the opportunities on offer, as projects receiving funding require huge investment and organisation, which is effectively an obstacle to small and medium-sized enterprises taking part.</p>
      <p sl="it">The time required for procedures is another problem. These are often muddled and bureaucratic, and out of step with the activities and requirements of the industry in question. I do not wish to reiterate the importance of these companies to our socio-economic fabric, and therefore I hope that a dialogue can be initiated with small and medium-sized enterprises that will help speed up procedures and eliminate as much red tape as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EIB can, and must, have an important role in managing recent events in the Mediterranean. Europe needs to think beyond the emergency and to implement a long-term strategy in order to ensure that funding and investment is made in situ , based on shared decisions, to promote democracy and development of the social and market economy.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to highlight two main points in this report. Firstly, the European Investment Bank has a central role in the Europe 2020 strategy. This relates, in particular, to investments in green infrastructure. In order for it to be possible for the European economy to be strong and sustainable, more investments are needed in railways and ports. These must also be linked to road networks in effective transport hubs. The infrastructure must be made into a well-functioning whole. The European Investment Bank should be even more active in these key areas. This requires a new way of thinking when it comes to flexible finance solutions. European project bonds are an excellent step in the right direction, but these should be supplemented with more new financing options. Above all, I see an opportunity to develop a model in which there is more productive cooperation at European, national, regional and local level.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Secondly, the European Investment Bank has an important role in the EU’s development policy. There is definite potential for improvement there. The Bank’s activities should be made more transparent, they should be more locally based and be clearly focused on the main objectives of the Union’s development work. Environmental, poverty-related and development aspects should always be taken into consideration in the European Investment Bank’s decisions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EIB is providing up to EUR 1 billion for the construction of wind turbines and other renewable energy projects in the UK. While this fits neatly within the strategy to fight climate change, I am alarmed that the current criteria governing EIB funding lack transparency and accountability when it comes to the examination and due diligence of these projects. EUR 6 billion has been provided for wind farm developments across the EU, according to Mr Maystadt, but the EIB simply accepts the applications for funding from the governments concerned without scrutiny. I do not think that is good enough.</p>
      <p sl="en">Renewable energy companies in the UK claim that their turbines have a load factor of 30%. In fact, over the whole of last year, their load factor was only 21%. They do not work when the weather is coldest and demand for electricity is at its peak. They are not economically viable and they will double or treble electricity prices for consumers while failing to cut CO2 emissions. This is an unfolding financial scandal, and the EIB should stop funding wind energy.</p>

Mr Bloom described Members as eccentrics, greenies and bored housewives; I would suggest that he tells us what category he falls into.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now to my more substantive point about the European Investment Bank. Ireland has benefited, through funding for SMEs, but perhaps the President would comment – or others may comment – on how accessible that funding is, because announcements are made and SMEs are enthused by these announcements, but when they go to look for the credit line, it can be extremely difficult to access it. I do think this is an issue of practical importance to the SME sector and I would like a response on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Investment Bank (EIB) was established with the objective of supporting the aims and policies of the European Union, both within a Union framework and elsewhere. The Bank is itself financed through bonds which are guaranteed by the EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, has pointed out to us that the guarantees for EIB activities in the EU budget amounted to almost EUR 20 billion by the end of 2009, which is a lot even for the EU, and therefore Parliament is quite justified, in my opinion, in expecting an explanation of the risks associated with this obligation. It would also be good to know more about how the interest from the loans provided is to be used, and about the administrative fees secured from the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EIB is answerable to the EU Member States, the Court of Auditors and OLAF. The proposal to introduce possible regulatory supervision, which would involve monitoring the quality of the finances, the financial situation, the precise measurement of results and compliance with the rules of the best practices included in the Cutaş report, looks like a good idea to me, and I would therefore like to recommend that the Commission seriously considers setting it up in the interests of greater transparency in the management of EU resources.</p>

The role of the loans for the structural programmes is to increase the level of absorption and make more effective use and increase the leverage function of European financial aid resources, especially in the areas faced with low access rates to funds.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Maystadt, this debate is of great importance for the economies of our Member States. It has shown that those countries that have a healthy balance between large concerns and small and medium-sized enterprises have come out of the crisis best. Looking at Germany, we have a situation in which 70% of the economy consists of SMEs, and this is enabling us to provide appropriate numbers of jobs and training places.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need to pass on the message to the various banks in the Member States that this makes it easier to make investments, that small and medium-sized enterprises can be expanded, and that the European Investment Bank provides support for this. This is very important if we are to return our economies to growth and be competitive vis-à-vis America and South-East Asia in the marketplace. I therefore consider this initiative by the European Investment Bank to be of the greatest importance. However, it also needs to be effective in bringing about growth, to bring us out of the economic and financial crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, several honourable Members referred to the issue of proper regulatory supervision. I would like to assure them that the Commission is giving careful consideration to the question of EIB regulatory supervision. Indeed, there is a need for an appropriate supervision framework to ensure that the EIB’s excellent credit standing can be preserved at all times. However, the supranational nature of the EIB and the EIB statutory provisions, which form part of the Treaty, should be taken properly into account.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EIB has recently taken concrete steps to address the situation, in particular, through the enforcement of its audit committee, which has significant banking supervisory experience. In addition to this, since the EIB has been granted refinancing from the ECB, it complies also with the necessary reporting requirements vis-à-vis the ECB.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, we believe that the European banking authority and the ECB cannot ensure the regulatory supervision of the EIB but, of course, we will not rule out the possibility for the EIB to fund other types of arrangements based on a voluntary approach by the EIB with other bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards cooperation and the role of the Commission in cooperation with the EIB, here, I would like to underline that the Commission already has a significant role in the governance of the EIB in that it delivers an opinion on all EIB loans, on own resources, and has representatives sitting on the board of directors of the EIB. I can assure you that cooperation between the Commission and the EIB is exemplary and excellent.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the supervision of the external EU programmes and the related discharge procedures, apart from the EIB activities under the aegis of the European Development Fund, meaning mostly the ACP investment facility, which are carried out under the specific EDF financial regulation, we are not aware of any other EU budget activity carried out in combination with EIB resources which are not subject to the usual discharge procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to Mrs Hübner, of course we fully agree with the calls to maximise the potential of the EIB by opening new leverages for increasing the potential to offer credits and help SMEs, especially at this time of post-financial crisis and pressure on credits. Therefore, we are also looking for innovative approaches on how to do this. I would just like to remind the House that the EU Financial Regulation has recently been modified to recognise explicitly this call for innovative instruments. We are already using it, especially in the programmes that are oriented towards financing research and innovation. I am sure that with the experience gathered from this project, the innovative financing tools can be used in other areas as well.</p>

    <intervention id="4-040-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Philippe Maystadt" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the EIB">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I am grateful to all the speakers for their comments, even though I felt that one of them was particularly inaccurate. Clearly, in the time I have available to me, I cannot respond in detail to all the extremely interesting issues that have been raised. Some of them, I think, could be examined in more depth in committee.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In particular, there was the important issue raised by Mrs Hübner. If you want the EIB genuinely to be able to make a significant contribution to the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular, through the development of joint instruments with the Commission, then the regulatory framework obviously has to allow it. Whilst you are currently debating the new draft financial rules, I think that you should be careful to ensure that the European Investment Bank will actually be able to make that contribution. The proposal made by the Commission seems to us, from that point of view, to be wholly appropriate. The Council and Parliament still need to accept it, though. You therefore have a part to play in reviewing the financial rules.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that a more in-depth study would also be worthwhile for other issues that have been raised: the issue of tax havens, which Mr Canfin addressed. I can confirm to him that the European Investment Bank has a stricter policy than the other international financial institutions on this issue, which also explains why we recently had to refuse to cofinance certain projects with the African Development Bank, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development: they failed to meet the stricter criteria that we have in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I can tell Mr Canfin that it is out of the question for us to finance a promoter located in a country on the OECD’s blacklist, but I am quite prepared to examine this issue in more detail, together with the issues raised by Mr Klute, which included loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and transparency in that regard. I do not think that there are many financial institutions that are willing to give as much information about allocations to small and medium-sized enterprises, and I would stress that there has been a marked increase in the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that have benefited from loans granted by the European Investment Bank to intermediary banks. More than 60 000 small businesses benefited from them in 2010.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to highlight three features that make the European Investment Bank a rather unique institution. The first is that, contrary to what one of you said, we do not use taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To be clear, we do not ask the UK taxpayer for one single cent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We do not use taxpayers’ money; we use the funds that we raise every day on the world’s financial markets. Indeed, that is why it is essential for us to maintain our triple A rating. We borrow in Asia and the United States, and with the resources thus collected, we can finance projects on favourable terms. The only budgetary impact is the guarantee that is given concerning the political risk in implementing the external mandate granted to us by the Council and Parliament. Here, there is, in fact, a guarantee that has a provisional cost for the European budget, since we set aside 9% of all loans granted under the external mandate – we do so two years after the first disbursement – and, of course, this amount decreases as the loans are paid back. Therefore, since we do not actually have to use that guarantee, there is ultimately no cost to the European budget. None! It is important to realise, then, that we are clearly not an institution that costs taxpayers money.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second feature: we are the only truly European financial institution; our shareholders are all Member States, and they are exclusively Member States of the European Union. We are the only financial institution that is legally obliged, under the Treaty, to financially support the European Union’s political objectives. Furthermore, we are the only financial institution that cannot finance a project unless it has already received the favourable opinion of the European Commission. The European Commission delivers that opinion after an assessment by all the services, by all the Directorates-General, from the Directorate-General for Competition to the Directorate-General for the Environment. We are therefore bound to strictly apply European rules and policies. We are subject to audits by the Court of Auditors to the extent required by the tripartite agreement. We cooperate at all times with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and I would add that we are on the verge of agreeing to supervision by the new European Banking Authority. In any case, as far as the European Investment Bank is concerned, we would be quite happy to submit to an official form of banking supervision. We are supervised indirectly, for example, by people with experience in banking supervision who we involve in our audit committee. However, I would confirm once again that we are completely open to proper supervision by this new European authority.</p>
      <p sl="fr">To conclude, the third feature that I should like to highlight is the fact that the European Investment Bank is also rather unique because of the kind of expertise it has developed. We are an institution that permanently employs more than 100 engineers, plus a number of specialist consultants, which is rare for a bank.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, we have acknowledged experience and expertise in certain areas. To give you an example, we are called on to provide technical advice for projects that we cannot finance because they are based in a region outside our mandate. I therefore think that it would be a shame not to use that expertise. In certain areas, such as urban transport, energy efficiency, the water cycle and support for SMEs, the EIB has clearly developed expertise that is rather unique. I shall therefore conclude by saying that it would be a shame not to fully exploit that potential, through cooperation with the European Parliament that is perhaps more systematic and more structured.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Some very valid questions have been asked. We are financing more in Turkey simply because that is our mandate, decided jointly by the Council and Parliament. It has set us the task of financing more in the candidate countries, which means that we finance proportionally more in Turkey and in Croatia than in other countries. We are here to carry out the mandates that are given to us by the European authorities, in particular, by the Council and Parliament. I therefore believe that this justifies, perhaps, systematic and more structured cooperation with the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The most important requirements are that the activities of the European Investment Bank be even more transparent for the European Parliament and that the financial instruments outsourced by it be used in an even more targeted manner. We recommend for consideration the proposal that prudential supervision be introduced for this institution as well in the interest of the precise measurement of the quality of the EIB’s financial situation and its results, as well as compliance with effective and successful business practice. I would like to stress that we are not making this proposal because we have doubts about the regularity of the EIB’s activity but because, in our view, as a general rule, as the G20’s London Declaration clearly stated two years ago, ‘all systemically important financial institutions, markets, and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight’. We suggest calling on the European Commission to provide the European Parliament with the legal analysis of the options for the prudential supervision of the EIB by 30 November 2011, because under the effective legislation, no European institution has the right to supervise the EIB. However, in view of the increased role of the EIB, and also because of the extension of EU guarantees to it, changing this urgently is warranted. It would be justified to develop increased professional and social supervision, similarly to the practice which has evolved in recent times at other non-bank financial institutions. The EIB’s lending activity needs to become more selective, more effective and more result-oriented in the future, particularly as regards financing SMEs. To this end, information on loans granted must also be collected and published more systematically.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2000/75/EC as regards vaccination against bluetongue (COM(2010)0666 – 05499/2011 – C7-0032/2011 – 2010/0326(COD)) (A7-0121/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="4-049-000" speaker_id="23784" name="Janusz Wojciechowski" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is with great satisfaction that I can present my report to Parliament on amendments to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue, a disease which poses a huge risk to cattle, sheep and goat breeding in many EU Member States. I am particularly happy since, three years ago in this Chamber, during a previous term of office, I had the privilege of presenting a report on a new strategy for animal health based on the principle ‘better prevention than cure’. Today’s amendment to the directive as regards vaccination against bluetongue is a practical realisation of this very principle. We are improving protection against this disease, and we are contributing to better animal health. Costs relating to their treatment will be lower and the whole vaccination process will be better organised.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The amendment relates to the fact that the current directive from the year 2000 was adapted to conditions at the time and, in particular, to the vaccinations which were then available on the market. Those vaccinations had to be and still have to be administered, but with certain restrictions due to the fact that there is a danger of the virus being transferred from vaccinated animals to those which have not been vaccinated. This means that various restrictions are required during the vaccination process, for example, vaccinations being administered in specified areas and restrictions being applied to the movements of animals. This represents quite a burden for breeders and, as a result, the efficacy of these vaccinations is limited. Science has taken a step forward. We have second-generation vaccinations which have been tested and can be administered without any fear of transferring viruses to unvaccinated animals. As a result, they can be administered without applying the current restrictions. Therefore, administering these vaccinations will be beneficial for breeders, as they will be less of a burden and certainly more effective. It will be possible to administer them to a much wider extent.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Procedures are moving very quickly as far as this matter is concerned. The Committee on Agriculture carried out its work shortly after receiving draft legislation from the European Commission, and is now presenting it to Parliament. We are hoping that it will be possible to carry out mass vaccinations using the new vaccine during the summer season this year. This is the reason for the amendments and this is why Parliament, in its amendments to the report which I have tabled, has included timescales within which the legislation of Member States should be adapted to the requirements of the directive, so that the vaccinations can be carried out this year and we will not have to wait until the next season.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to remind you of the controversy which has surrounded the report and the amendments to the directive concerning the correlation tables proposed by the Commission. In my report, we agree with the introduction of an obligation to include correlation tables which contain information regarding the transposition of the directive into national legislation and which specific provisions transpose provisions of the directive into national legislation. This is considered to be a bureaucratic requirement by the administrations of certain Member States, but it should be viewed differently. Thanks to the introduction of this requirement, European law will become more transparent. It will be easier for citizens to check whether a directive has been transposed into national legislation, and in what way. I think this is good practice. As far as I am aware, this is the first, or one of the first, directives to be adopted which introduces this requirement, and I think it does so quite rightly. This should become standard practice for our legislation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Once more, I would like to thank you for allowing me to present the report and I feel that we are improving the lot of the breeders as well as reducing the suffering of animals in the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission is grateful to Parliament for its support for the proposal to further facilitate vaccination against bluetongue and for its recommendation in relation to this very important issue. In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, for his commitment to this cause.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bluetongue has been the cause of a great deal of concern to all farmers in the European Union. Until the 1990s, bluetongue was considered exotic to the EU, with outbreaks only occurring sporadically in southern Europe. However, recent years have brought several epidemic waves of the disease, affecting many Member States, including in central and northern Europe, causing significant losses to livestock production and disruption of the trade in live animals.</p>
      <p sl="en">The past few years have seen a significant improvement in the bluetongue situation across the EU, thanks in no small measure to massive vaccination campaigns largely cofinanced by the European Union. The EU cofinanced EUR 150 million in 2008, and allocated EUR 120 million in 2009 and EUR 100 million for the following years. Under current rules, vaccination is only allowed in areas that are subject to certain restrictions because of the presence of bluetongue disease. The proposed amendments to the directive introduce the possibility of using inactivated vaccines everywhere in the European Union. The amendment would allow a wider use of preventive vaccinations against bluetongue and this will ensure better control of the disease and lessen the burden it causes to the agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s report is most timely and important for the animal health situation in the European Union. The report rightly recognises the need for urgency in order to give Member States sufficient time to vaccinate animals before the next bluetongue season starts. We must not lose sight of the fact that, although the bluetongue situation has improved greatly in recent years, the disease has not been eradicated. The EU remains at risk for new epidemic waves of bluetongue in the future and it is important that Member States have the opportunity to protect animals against the virus when they are at risk. Member States should be able to optimise their vaccination programmes with the aim of reducing the impact of future bluetongue outbreaks in the European Union. Indeed, a number of Member States have already indicated that they wish to implement this measure at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur refers to the really very difficult issue of the correlation tables, which are very important for tracking the correct, appropriate transposition of EU legislation into national legal systems. This is a longstanding issue and we have had many debates in this House on how to control and monitor the proper transposition of EU law into national legal systems. We can see that the correlation tables are the best tool for doing this, monitoring it and assuring appropriate transposition of EU law.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we are very aware that, especially with such urgent issues as the one we are discussing today, we need to work very hard to find a solution between Parliament and the Council in order to avoid unnecessary blockages. I hope that the Council will demonstrate sufficient flexibility so that this legislation can be adopted on time before the start of the season in which bluetongue can break out.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, the proposal for a directive on vaccination against bluetongue is a very important step towards eradicating this dangerous animal disease. It is a disease that affects ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats. It can result in the animals dying. The new inactivated vaccines enable the risk of infection to be excluded, so that this vaccine can also be successfully used in areas where the disease has not yet occurred.</p>
      <p sl="de">This will allow the Member States to use the vaccinations more effectively, significantly reducing the burden on the agricultural sector as a result of this disease. The new vaccines allow the disease to be combated on a genuinely broad front once and for all, and I hope that the Member States and farmers will take this opportunity. It provides greater safety, and it is unquestionably a major improvement in animal health.</p>
      <p sl="de">The more we contain the spread of bluetongue using the new vaccines, the greater the opportunities to export farm animals for the benefit of the economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In order that the directive may enter into force and the new vaccines may be made available, it is, in fact, important that we take a decision quickly. On Monday, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development sent out a clear signal by unanimously adopting the report, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will follow its lead in today’s plenary vote. I support the rapporteur’s call to leave the correlation tables in the report. After all, we cannot take decisions in Europe without the Member States providing information on how they are implemented. We also need this transparency – and I say this to the Council very clearly – in order to strengthen the credibility of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his good work and constructive cooperation. Many thanks! The report will have our support.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, bluetongue has been a constant threat to our livestock and, hence, to public health.</p>
      <p sl="es">Hitherto, we used an activated vaccine to fight this disease, the use of which entails the need to restrict the movement of animals to certain areas in order to prevent the virus from spreading to non-infected animals.</p>
      <p sl="es">Use of the vaccine, use of vaccination, was therefore limited to areas where infected animals had been detected in the past. This was detrimental to the farmers affected, who suffered on two accounts: firstly, because of the disease, and secondly, because of the restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="es">All these problems can apparently be avoided through use of a new inactivated vaccine, which, in addition to preventing potential disturbances in the internal livestock market, will also enable the development of new, further-reaching – which is what really matters – prevention strategies for combating this disease.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is therefore vital for the livestock industry that we amend the directive to allow the use of this vaccine, and that we do this as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, adherence to our Treaties, particularly as regards correlation tables, should not be an excuse for not bringing this regulation into force before the summer. Such a delay would only cause further damage to farmers.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, I would like to say a big thank you to Mr Wojciechowski for his excellent and efficient work. Previous speakers have mentioned what this is actually about: a new effective vaccine. I would therefore like to use my few seconds to point out that this is perhaps the first tangible proof of what will happen in our agriculture when the climate changes dramatically. In Sweden, where I come from, the idea that we would have a disease like bluetongue in ruminants would have been completely unrealistic four or five years ago. It was a sporadic disease in southern Europe. Today, it is a reality and we have had our first epidemic. It is therefore very important for us now to get going with the vaccination, but it is also extremely important, when we talk about climate, the environment and the future, to realise that it is not only aridity and precipitation that will change. A major change in climate will also bring something quite different: disease epidemics and epizootics among both people and animals. We must bring this into the equation when we discuss the Europe 2020 strategy, for example. What direction do we intend to take? That is also important for us as legislators to understand. We can only take decisions on the basis of the knowledge that we have today, but we must have the flexibility to be able to take new decisions when we acquire new knowledge and – in this case – new vaccines.</p>

I want to go back to the area of the correlation tables. The Commissioner said that he hoped it would be good enough, but I have to say to the Commissioner that ‘hope’ is not enough. This is a very serious disease that we need to get control of this summer. It is carried by small flies, by what we call midges, and has to be brought under control this summer.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Wojciechowski has done his bit and he cannot be blamed in any way for any delay. It would be very unfortunate if infighting in Brussels or excessive bureaucracy were to result in a delay. We certainly need action, because the disease travels extremely fast and we have to be able to vaccinate outside affected areas. I have to remind the House that on many occasions, as Mr Wojciechowski and others have said, prevention is better than cure. On this occasion, I think we have got to move, and I want the Commission to give us an assurance that bureaucracy will not hold us back.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is a disease in respect of which farmers should make their own decisions, based on their own particular circumstances. As a UK farmer, I will rely on veterinary recommendation and not the opinion of bureaucrats in other countries. I appreciate the support of the British taxpayer who funds my vaccines and I am frustrated that the EU needs to be involved at all. You gave us this disease. Please do not make matters worse.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now discussing this question despite assurances that the Lisbon Treaty did not constitute a fundamental change. If that is so, why do so many measures, large and small, like this one, have to be recast to conform to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union? We do not know how the issue of correlation tables is going to be resolved, and this topic perfectly illustrates the confusion that so-called codecision can lead to.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur for this report. While I am generally in favour of the principle behind this report, I would like to add that this vaccine should only be used when the competent authority identifies significant risk to the livestock population. In Northern Ireland, both farmers and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development have worked extremely hard to keep Northern Ireland a free area.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that the Commission and the Council recognise free area status within the EU and put safeguards in place for these areas. However, there still remains a significant risk within Europe that this disease may spread and, as a result, I believe it is necessary that Northern Ireland has the ability to use the vaccines. It is imperative that the competent authority monitor movements and impose trade bans where necessary to stop the spread of bluetongue and that good practice is followed by all of the actors.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that all Member States work constructively together to reduce the risk of the spread of this disease and protect the industry from a major outbreak. Communication between Member States and the Commission is a vital part of monitoring and controlling disease outbreaks. I would encourage this.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, epidemics, like bluetongue, have a serious impact not only on livestock farmers, but also on consumers and the European economy in general, as a result of causing animal mortality and trade disruption.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Animal movement restrictions hit hard the economic resources of the locations or regions where they are imposed. With a preventive vaccination campaign, for example, under current legislation, a restriction zone must be maintained, even if no incidence of bluetongue has been recorded. This is why the measure proposed by the Commission is fair and economically beneficial to producers and consumers. At the same time, the measure is in keeping with the principle of using every scientific advance in agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should also mention the important contribution which the European funds have made so far to improving the situation with regard to bluetongue epidemics. The Union has cofinanced major vaccination campaigns, amounting to EUR 370 million in the last three years, as also mentioned by the Commissioner. I think that cofinancing of the vaccination programmes should also continue in the coming years, given their effectiveness and the new, much simpler legislative framework which we are debating today.</p>

The disease causes intense suffering and death amongst the affected animals and has a measurable negative impact on the rural economy and the farming community. I welcome measures allowing Member States to use inactivated vaccination against bluetongue in areas not affected by the disease, and thank the rapporteur for his work on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States should be allowed the flexibility to be proactive and draw upon technological advances in vaccine production, thus reducing the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease and preventing occurrence without negating the disease-free status of the Member States, as was previously the case. Vaccination represents an effective veterinary measure in response to bluetongue which, when accompanied by further measures such as surveillance, means that eradication of the disease in Europe is a real possibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">For too long, our vaccination strategy has been held back by the fact that we have not developed sophisticated enough products to allow vaccination of animals outside exclusion zones. Being in an exclusion zone can be disastrous for a farmer’s livelihood. It can also be disastrous not to protect your animals from disease, especially one as damaging and virulent as bluetongue. The development of new vaccines and the rules changes which I hope the Parliament will agree today will allow the UK to move to bluetongue-free status. It will allow freer movement of animals and save money in rural areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, it is vitally important that these rules are brought into force as soon as possible. Farmers in the West Country need to be able to vaccinate before the end of May to ensure that animals are fully protected. All of us here understand the background to the interinstitutional battle raging over correlation tables, but I can tell you that the farmers I represent do not understand it and they rely on us, their elected representatives, to sort it out for them. This is an urgent issue and common sense must prevail. Let us get on with this now, agree a fast track for urgent issues of this kind, and get on and get our livestock vaccinated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, bluetongue is an animal epidemic affecting ruminants that has already caused great damage throughout the livestock and production sector. Since the break-out of epidemics in a number of Member States in 2000, considerable economic damage has been caused. As always, whenever economic losses occur, the financial damage affects those at the bottom of the production chain most. In particular, the flourishing trade in breeding cattle collapsed. Despite vaccination, exports were completely paralysed in some countries. In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers had their livelihoods threatened.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must take the time now to take preventive action. The disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge at any time. We need to learn from experience and be able to offer assistance quickly. What was true ten years ago no longer applies. The old directive on measures to combat bluetongue from 2000 needs to be improved and updated.</p>
      <p sl="de">The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers. The rules of that time were designed for the use of live attenuated vaccines, which were the only vaccines available at the time the directive was adopted 10 years ago. Today’s vaccines are more advanced. We need to take account of this fact.</p>
      <p sl="de">I welcome the rapid action on the part of the Commission and of Parliament and advocate the rapid implementation of the new directive. As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle. Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of breeders and farmers. Many thanks to the rapporteur.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have no real objections to the proposals in this legislative resolution, and I would like to congratulate the Commission for this initiative, which seeks to recognise scientific developments and permit the use of vaccines against bluetongue outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions, as this type of vaccine does not present any risk to the undesired circulation of the virus.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would also like to congratulate and express my thanks for the work undertaken by the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Wojciechowski, and its President, Mr De Castro, which has allowed the Council and the Commission to come to a swift agreement with regard to the legal basis of this proposal. Unlike what was initially proposed, therefore, legislative powers are shared by Parliament and the Council under the ordinary legislative procedure introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has discussed and approved its report in a short space of time so as to allow today’s vote here to take place, and so that the next step towards the agreement with the Council can be taken as soon as possible and thus allow the new provisions of this directive to enter into force. I would therefore like to call upon the Council to come to a compromise with the Commission and Parliament’s position, which I am sure will be approved here today by a large majority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, adapting the rules on vaccination for bluetongue is in accordance with the new EU vaccination policy as expressed in the Animal Health strategy 2007-2013 under the slogan ‘Prevention is better than cure’.</p>
      <p sl="de">A more flexible procedure for the vaccination of livestock is necessary if we are to be able to combat epidemics such as bluetongue more effectively and reduce their impact on farming. Greater flexibility and prevention would undoubtedly be desirable for a number of animal epidemics.</p>
      <p sl="de">A strict policy of non-vaccination such as we have long pursued in the EU is no longer relevant. Consequently, I am of the opinion that we are taking the right step here. I would also like to support Mrs Paulsen, who said that we must expect to see other animal epidemics in the near future as a result of climate change. This, in turn, suggests that we need a clear strategy, and here of course, we can correctly practise this. In this context, I would also like to reiterate that there should be no further discussion of culling in the Commission either.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the case of bluetongue, we have, of course, benefited from the fact that we supported research and now have an inactivated vaccine and are able to carry out comprehensive vaccination, which was previously very dangerous and very difficult. We are therefore in a new situation here.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to thank the rapporteur for having worked so quickly. Experience has taught us to expect the first outbreaks in late summer and autumn. The countries therefore need to elaborate vaccination strategies and also implement these.</p>
      <p sl="de">To Mr Agnew, I would like to say that if you have a good vet, then he will recommend vaccination, because that is what is wanted by the vets that I know and it is what I have heard repeatedly during the discussions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, that is not the end of it. The Commission needs to draw up implementing regulations and adapt these to the new process, and that needs to be done just as quickly as here in Parliament. I therefore call on the Commission to work quickly so that we can put this scientific progress to use before the end of the year.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to our fellow Member, Mr Wojciechowski, for his report, which reminds us of the importance of appropriate legislation on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, whether the vaccine is live attenuated or inactivated, given the current state of our knowledge, blood tests do not enable us to identify how the pathogenic organism entered the animal’s blood – in other words, whether it originated in a vaccine or in the wild. Therefore, unless a marked inactivated vaccine – that is, a vaccine of which the pathogenic organism is of vaccine origin – is developed, it will be impossible to distinguish between a vaccinated animal and an animal infected by the virus. Yet that is an essential condition if a region or a country is to be declared safe from any contamination. There is a great risk, therefore, that countries that are protected from any contamination will put up trade barriers between themselves and countries that use that inactivated vaccine.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Hence, the European Union has a duty to encourage ongoing research into a marked inactivated vaccine so as to ensure greater biosecurity within the Union, something which will enable us to combine our health and trade approaches more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is worth recording the Commissioner’s comment that the instance of bluetongue is on the decline: from 48 000 cases in 2008 to 120 in 2010. That said, we are still not sure what the trend will be in the future, so the development of this inactivated vaccine and discussion of the technicalities around its use are very welcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would be useful if the Council were in the Chamber so that we could address the issue of whether it is willing actually to provide the correlation tables that Parliament and the Commission believe to be essential – and perhaps this is something on which the Council could come back to us quite swiftly. The prevention of all diseases, and of this one in particular, centres on animal husbandry, on the restriction of animal movement, on protection from vectors and on the issue discussed this morning – namely vaccination.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the problem with using inactive vaccine for vaccinations outside the closed zone is that animals will show positive results in serological tests, and in order to determine whether animals have been vaccinated or are actually sick, it will be necessary to perform a virological test, which is more expensive. This will create problems as regards trade in, and transfers of, animals. In view of the fact that it involves the transposition of the directive into national law, the deadline of 30 June 2011 will, for procedural reasons, also be difficult to achieve. Personally, I also disagree with changing the date of entry into force of the directive from the earlier date of 20th to the day following its publication. We should also understand that drawing up correlation tables will add further to the administrative burden.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, improving the vaccination arrangements for bluetongue is an extremely important matter. The new inactivated vaccines allow producers, for the first time, to exclude the risk of infection with this potentially highly dangerous disease, because the vaccines can now also be used in areas in which bluetongue has not previously been found. In view of this, we must repeatedly emphasise that agriculture – including exports of breeding animals – is an important factor in all the countries of Europe. Farmers therefore need to be able to take advantage of the latest knowledge in animal health, which has been used to develop these vaccines.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are two things that we now particularly need. Firstly, we need a rapid solution concerning practice in the European Union. Secondly, in my view, we just as urgently need an obligation for the measures introduced in the Member States to be notified; in other words, an obligation on the Member States to report to the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would first like to thank the House for its strong support for this proposal and also for its recognition of the urgency of the matter and the very speedy procedures.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several of you referred to the problem of correlation tables. I would just like to remind you that the Conference of Presidents injected fresh impetus into tackling this issue, and has accorded it greater importance, notably in recognition of the problem of the transposition of EU legislation into national law.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to ask whether it is really so difficult for the Member States to notify the Commission of the legal basis on which they transposed the EU regulation into their national legal order. Is it really so difficult? I am sure that when they are considering how to transpose legislation, they must do some preparation and decide how they intend to transpose it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we all recognise the fact – and we have had several debates on this issue – that the European Union suffers when the transposition of EU law is uneven. In particular, on an issue as important as the one we are discussing today, incorrect transposition could have detrimental effects.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, as I said in my opening remarks, I would emphasise that the Commission is clearly against unnecessary hold-ups. We are fully aware of the urgency of this matter. Therefore, I hope that, through increased flexibility and intensive negotiations, we can find a solution to this problem. The Commission will try to be as helpful as possible so that we can adopt this legislation before the beginning of the season for a potential bluetongue outbreak.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the Commission’s readiness to implement this measure, I would like to assure Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Uggias that the Commission has done its part. Our implementing measures are almost complete. What we need is approval of this proposal by the legislator. Once we have that, we can proceed very quickly.</p>

Thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs and members of the Committee on Agriculture, thanks to whom we were able to proceed so rapidly and effectively with the report. It does not often happen that we are so unanimous in adopting a positive document which is obviously aiming to improve the current situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Regarding the correlation tables which were referred to in the discussion as a possible source of problems, I think that it would be difficult here to sympathise with the administrative bodies or governments of the Member States. Creating the tables and sending them to the Commission will really not be much of a problem. What is certain is that citizens who want to check whether their Member State’s legislation accords with European Union law will have greater problems. They are the ones who will have to put in the effort and research if there are no tables, as has been the case until now. It is very often difficult to find one’s way around EU legislation. I think and hope that this instrument will be available to anyone who is interested, not only the Commission, and that it will be a readily accessible document which will be available when needed. It will also be a very useful document.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I appeal to the Council not to take issue with the correlation tables, and if it must, not in this case, so that the new vaccinations can come into force during this season, as expected.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on EU tomato imports from Morocco (Petition 1565/2009 by José Maria Pozancos (Spanish)), by Erminia Mazzoni, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions (O-000040/2011 – B7-0211/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-075-000" speaker_id="96817" name="Erminia Mazzoni" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question we submitted as the Committee on Petitions shows that our Committee was not satisfied with the answer that the Commission gave to the issue raised by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants.</p>
      <p sl="it">In fact, the Commission focused its attention on the responsibility of Member States in setting prices, without considering the specific point made by the petition, which was to report irregular imports of tomatoes and other vegetables from Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="it">These alleged irregularities have, in fact, already been noted for some years by the regulatory body OLAF, which has pointed to the abusive application of the method for deduction provided for by Regulation (EC) No 3223/1994, which establishes three different methods of calculation. The consequences of this situation are lower revenues for the European Union, unfair competition and breach of market rules, as well as the gradual impoverishment of European producers and exporters, with seriously alarming situations reported, in particular, in Spain, Greece, Portugal, France and Italy.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commission is negotiating a new bilateral agreement with Morocco, and once again this agreement seems to not be taking these alarming facts into consideration, but to be continuing along the path towards implementation of a flow of exports from Morocco to the European Union which is totally unregulated and does not comply with European law.</p>
      <p sl="it">I think this is a subject we should focus on. It is a subject which relates to and touches on a currently sensitive nerve, which is that of migration flows. In fact, this great mass of people coming from the countries along the North African coast, including Morocco, to the European Union often involves farm labourers, as the recent events in Rosarno show.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are struggling to receive them. Above all, we are struggling as the European Union, and particularly as Italy, to offer them a livelihood. Further reducing the potential for agricultural production in our countries, and therefore in France, Spain, Italy and Portugal, which are having serious problems at the moment, would cause all kinds of damage. I would like to know what the Commission intends to do.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if you will allow me, I will try to answer several questions that were raised in this petition. I would like to thank Mrs Mazzoni for bringing up this question so we can clarify our position on this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I would like to assure the House that the Commission monitors the quantity of tomatoes imported from Morocco closely, attentively, using a cross-checking system based on designation of quantities imported by Moroccan operators and daily import records kept by national customs authorities. The Commission, until today, does not have any proof of systemic fraud or systemic failure of the system that was put in place. We have the information concerning one case, to which I will come back a little later. This is related to the year 2007, when OLAF indeed emphasised that the system as it stands at present could result in opportunistic behaviour but not necessarily involving irregular behaviour.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is recalled that the application of the entry price system and the levying of possible import duties in connection with this mechanism are the exclusive competence of the customs authorities of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another aspect to this question, which is quite important, is the international context of this matter, something that is really dominated by the Doha Round, which has not yet been completed. Any change to the entry price system and its current application mechanism could have a detrimental impact on the results achieved so far. The new bilateral agreement with Morocco preserves the interests of the European producers by maintaining the system of monthly tariff quotas of tomatoes and strict control of the quantities imported.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the agreement provides for improved cooperation and greater transparency in terms of market data in the fruit and vegetable sector. The quantitative increase in the tomatoes quota has been limited to 52 000 tonnes, which is well below traditional trade levels, and the increase is progressive and staggered over four marketing years, thereby preserving current market shares and the traditional supply to the European Union. The Commission therefore considers that any change to the current entry price system must respect the terms of the relevant international agreements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission ensures that the regulation is properly applied and therefore has carried out the investigation through OLAF. This is probably the case Mrs Mazzoni is referring to; whether there are irregularities as a result of incorrect interpretation of the implementing regulation. However, it is the responsibility of the national customs authorities to follow up on the results of the investigation. Recuperation is in progress but the publication of the data is strictly the responsibility of the competent customs authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the organisation of surveillance; this was one of the items that was raised by Mrs Mazzoni. Here, I have to say that the Commission, as I said, monitors tomato imports from Morocco using a cross-checking system. The quantities imported and reported by the Moroccan authorities on a weekly basis are monitored. The data is then compared with the data provided by the national customs authorities, who survey the system, and also by Eurostat. I think that we have very good and precise information and, if there were some systematic fraud and systematic irregularities, we would definitely spot it and take action.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would firstly like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Petitions for its hard work following the complaint brought by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, based on the report published by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, in 2007. I believe this report’s conclusions are extremely clear and justify only too well action on the part of the European Commission – which should have addressed this matter a long time ago – to clarify the operation of the entry price regime, at least in relation to the tomato sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, not only having failed to take any action to prevent the different types of fraud made possible by the current Entry Price Regulation, the Commission has negotiated a new agriculture agreement with Morocco without having first resolved the shortcomings of the import regime currently in place.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for the European Commission to take its responsibilities seriously, to start investigating where and how fraud is being committed, and, potentially, to demand payment of any unpaid customs duties. I believe that there is no way that a new agreement with Morocco should be ratified until all the details we have set out are resolved.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our aim is not to hinder new international agreements, but to ensure that such agreements will not seriously damage the interests of European producers, and that the rules laid down in those agreements will be adhered to.</p>
      <p sl="es">Where the new agreement with Morocco is concerned, all the European fruit and vegetables sector is demanding is a guarantee that the terms agreed will, in fact, be observed. This will only be made possible by reforming the entry price regime. We cannot have a new agreement with Morocco until we have a new system for entry prices. We will not be able to ratify the agreement that the Commission has already concluded.</p>
      <p sl="es">Moreover, if this supervisory role is to be played by the Member States, they should be required to make a significant financial contribution. However, it is also true that we have long been calling for a European borders and customs system similar to that of the United States, so as to ensure effective control.</p>

      <p sl="pl">According to the Spanish farmers who presented a petition to the European Parliament, underpriced imported Moroccan tomatoes pose a threat to European food producers. They are referring to the underpriced minimum rate which was set at approximately EUR 46 per 100 kg in a preferential import-export agreement between the EU and Morocco. According to EUROSTAT, Morocco exported over 70 000 tonnes of tomatoes in December 2010, which is over double the quota foreseen in the agreement between the EU and Morocco. This is what has caused heavy losses to European producers, never mind the losses from customs payments. OLAF has already commented on this matter, stating in its 2007 report that there may be irregularities in the importing of tomatoes from Morocco in connection with the underpricing of tomatoes in comparison with the initial price agreed by the EU, which, in effect, allows for the non-payment of additional customs duties. In adding my voice to that of other members of the Committee on Petitions, I would, however, like to ask whether the Commission has any intention of revising rules of this kind, and of possibly recovering the unpaid customs duties.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, last October, I tabled a written question to the Commission concerning the discrepancies between the figures in the different EU services on the EU import of tomatoes from Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2008, there were about 100 000 tonnes in difference between DG TAXUD and Eurostat. The Commission answered that it had observed the problem and was solving it, but it is not clear to me whether the Commission will achieve what European citizens and European producers deserve.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the European Union, we import tomatoes not only from Morocco but also from other third countries. We should find a way for negotiations to be very fair to everyone and not at the expense of the European agriculture sector. We should also find a way to control what we are importing from other countries outside the EU, especially in some northern European ports. Without effective border controls, the European agriculture sector will have a very difficult future.</p>
      <p sl="de">If European production of tomatoes is damaged by the EU-Morocco Agreement, it will be very difficult to regain production on EU soil. The rules and the obligations should be applied to everyone, which means fair competition. What we cannot accept is the application of different rules and duties to a European producer and an agricultural producer outside the EU. Accepting this means accepting the loss in competitiveness of our agricultural sector and a huge effect on the labour force in Europe. I am in favour of free trade, but under symmetric conditions of production and information. If they do not exist, free trade is not fair trade and competition is not fair competition.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I do not think that Parliament should ratify the EU-Morocco Agreement without the inclusion of clauses concerning the labour market, the social dimension and the environment in Morocco. If this does not happen, we may lose our European farming activity and our food chain industry.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, we raised several warnings during the debate on trade agreements on agricultural produce between Morocco and other Mediterranean countries, such as Egypt and Israel. We warned that if these were concluded, they would further increase the pressure faced by farmers in the EU to lower production prices, especially in countries like Portugal, and exacerbate the additional difficulties in disposing of their products. We condemn the liberalisation of trade in fruit and vegetables, which are typically Mediterranean products, as this would lead to large supermarkets stocking lower priced products, which are often exempt from the same rules and standards as those imposed on farmers in the EU. We would like to point out that the liberalisation of trade for agricultural produce promotes models of intensive production for export which favour big agribusiness at the expense of small and medium-sized farming, family farming, and supply for local and regional markets. All this has negative consequences on the sovereignty, security and quality of food, and on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This situation was the reason for our warnings, which the Commission has regrettably ignored, and is continuing to do so. It has ignored the need to defend the interests of EU producers, ensuring fair prices for production and business continuity, especially for small and medium-sized farming. Moreover, we now know that the Commission also ignored the report by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which denounced irregularities in the importing of tomatoes from Morocco, in a report acknowledging the impact of these imports on lowering tomato prices in the EU market. Not content with this, in the new agricultural chapter in the Association Agreement with Morocco, the Commission has decided to further increase tomato imports to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When will this liberal fundamentalism, which sacrifices everything to the interests of a few major European corporations and multinational exporters, finally be curbed? How does the Commission intend to make amends to European producers for the damage that it has clearly caused them? We will leave you with these questions.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the tomato growers of the Canary Islands, Murcia, Andalusia and the Community of Valencia, all of them European Union producers, need the Commission to take robust action with regard to an unfair situation which is causing them serious damage. Fraud is being committed, and you know it.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thanks to its agreement with the EU, Morocco benefits from an entry price to which it does not adhere. In addition, we should not only look at 2007, but also at 2010. The Commission is well aware that Spanish tomato growers have to compete with Moroccan growers under unfair conditions, as they must bear much higher production costs stemming from the strict European standards on quality, food safety and workplace safety, as well as restrictions on pesticides which are not required of third countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">Even so, our growers, with great effort and commitment to quality, continue to work hard to save their crops. Thus, it is unacceptable for the Commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime, whose complexity encourages fraud, as the European Anti-Fraud Office itself does, and for the Commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with Morocco are being contravened.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not enough for the Commission to tell us that surveillance is the responsibility of the Member States. If they fail in their duties, the Commission must act. It is intolerable for regulations on Moroccan import quotas to be breached, and for the applicable customs duties to go unpaid, without the Commission taking any action.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Commission would have us approve a new agreement with Morocco. Unless we are given assurances that the price system will be modified to prevent unfair competition between Moroccan and Spanish produce, we will certainly not be supporting that initiative.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is your obligation to ensure adherence to agreements, but it is also your obligation to defend the interests of growers in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia, and Andalusia. Do it before it is too late.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, calls for the Entry Price Regulation to be modified began in 2003. This Parliament, the Member States, Spain and France, with the support of Italy, Greece, and Portugal, have all requested it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The reason for this lies in the fact that the regulation is not being properly applied, with certain duties being left unpaid and a biased calculation method being used. As a consequence, the sector suffers, we have unfair competition, and the Member States receive less revenue from customs duties.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Special Corps of Fruit and Vegetable Inspectors has verified this, pointing out that Article 5 of the regulation allows a biased application and, as has been said earlier in this House, OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, has stated that the calculation method used enables non-payment of additional duties.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is up to the Commission to resolve this issue. A solution must be provided, to the production system and to the Member States. This situation has been going on for 16 years.</p>

      <p sl="it">The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) confirms that there have been irregularities in the calculation of duties on tomato imports and that this has been damaging to European producers, the very same producers who are expressing their concern at the expected increase in tomato and fruit and vegetable imports in general that will take place if the agreement is signed.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are obviously sensitive to the concerns brought about by bilateral agreements where the agricultural element is often sacrificed for the sake of broader industrial interests. It is not a good way to proceed, and we will continue to repeat this to the European Commission. However, I would like to point out that the current economic and political crisis throughout the Maghreb area should lead us to consider this agreement carefully and with greater solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, as requested by the petitioners from the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants, the Commission needs to modify – and here I am repeating the request put forward by Spain and other Member States – some of the articles of the regulation to which we are referring.</p>
      <p sl="es">Focusing on the calculation method for establishing entry prices, one of the three methods currently used, must be removed, specifically the one known as the ‘deductive’ method. This is the most necessary change, bearing in mind that importers choose the method that, at any given time, allows them to avoid paying additional duties.</p>
      <p sl="es">Now that the new agreement with Morocco is pending adoption by this Parliament for its entry into force, the Commission would certainly prove its worth by correcting the system once and for all. We are calling for this once again today, as properly working entry prices are the compensation that our growers can reasonably expect when its entry into force is agreed upon.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today’s debate following the petition presented by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits, Vegetables, Flowers and Live Plants is apt and well-timed, in view of the fact that the commercial agreement with Morocco is being discussed in Parliament at the same time.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is clear that the petition raises an issue to which the Commission does not yet seem to have provided an answer. This House strongly calls for the answer to be given before the new agreement is signed, because it is not acceptable that European farmers should continue to pay the price of this desire for free trade that is pervading Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">We need to defend and safeguard our farmers, not only with regard to tomato production, but also with regard to all fruit and vegetable production, which would be severely affected by this indiscriminate opening up of the market.</p>

    <intervention id="4-086-000" speaker_id="28365" name="Pier Antonio Panzeri" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the criticisms that we have heard here this morning in connection with the petition presented are understandable. I think there is still a long way to go before we can ensure that a possible general agreement on agricultural products with Morocco receives consensus approval. On the one hand, the agreement must respect the need for balance, and not cause serious difficulties for European agricultural producers. On the other, it must respect the need for clear and transparent rules of competition on agricultural markets. This is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the European Union and Morocco is a positive one.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore invite the Commission to look for suitable solutions that do not lose sight of the producers’ interests, but which also do not lose sight of a renewed policy of generosity towards Morocco, particularly in view of the events taking place in the Maghreb.</p>
      <p sl="it">It would be very useful to understand, and I do not want us to end up effectively importing tomato pickers, instead of agricultural products and tomatoes. It is therefore important to carry out a thorough investigation in order to create a new European policy.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I believe that the ‘business as usual’ policy has already been the cause of many misfortunes for us in the past. Therefore, we must be very cautious, particularly with regard to the current situation in North Africa. Precisely because of this, I would like to join in with those who have said that, under the current circumstances, it is scarcely appropriate to move forward with the trade agreement with Morocco.</p>
      <p sl="es">As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, I believe we need thorough clarification of the progress being made in the current framework. We must also clearly demand that any tomatoes – or any other produce – entering the European Union arrive under the same conditions as are demanded of local growers. In the absence of this assurance, we should – indeed must – rethink the entire framework, and this is what I hope this House will also do.</p>
      <p sl="es">Rather than adopting a protectionist policy, I believe there is a need for firm commitment to fair trade. We must also be free of any doubts as to what the framework is, so that we are able to know and to act as responsibly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I must thank all my fellow Members who have understood the problem of the Mediterranean region, the Spanish delegation, and all those who understand that we in the Canary Islands, Murcia, Valencia and Almeria, in addition to being frustrated at the Commission’s failure to honour its agreements, and to having seen many companies forced out of business, remain the entry point for immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the entry point for Moroccan immigrants, and a buffer against the crisis. This is because we are currently supporting, at a time of utter economic penury, people who come to work and are able to send money home to their families.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I believe that the Commission must also behave responsibly with regard to the competences granted to it by the Treaties. I believe the Commission has not given any thought to the need to defend the interests of the public, or to the need to prevent an indiscriminate policy which, moreover, makes us import produce grown in extremely dubious phytosanitary conditions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, one of the reasons the internal market was established was so as to provide European consumers with better protection. Consumers have a right to be able to buy healthy, fairly produced products throughout the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="de">Opening up the market – in other words, a controlled import quota – must therefore be subject to at least three requirements being met. Firstly, there must be clear control of the quantity of imports permitted. This relates mainly to the quantitative aspect. Secondly, the quality of the products must also be controlled. This also relates to production standards. Thirdly, the impact on farmers in the European Union needs to be taken into consideration. Business that harms third parties – and here, this generally means business that favours industry to the detriment of agriculture – must be prevented.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore ask the Commission to subject the agreement with Morocco to further careful scrutiny and not to sign it until it has undergone a further review.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to thank the Spanish producers who submitted this timely petition to us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, for months now, we in Parliament have been warning the Commission of the danger to our internal market of a number of bilateral agreements. Clearly, we are sensitive to the issue of Morocco’s development. Clearly, we know that creating stability for the Moroccan people in their own country is the best possible solution, and that it will stop us from having to solve numerous immigration problems in the future. However, when the Commission tells us that a new agreement will simply ratify a situation, we can plainly see, through the reports by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), that the situation to which the Commission refers is not the real solution.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, I should like to alert the Commission to another point. We are told that the negotiated – the renegotiated – agreements will enable us to support Moroccan producers. Which producers are we talking about, though? The exporters are primarily large agri-food companies that have set up huge farms in Morocco. Small Moroccan producers are not the ones who benefit from our agreements, as they do not have the capacity to produce in conditions acceptable to the European market. Let us not confuse the issue, but do not mislead the MEPs either: that is my request to the Commission.</p>

    <intervention id="4-091-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maroš Šefčovič" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, if you will allow me, I will start with some figures because they were referred to by several speakers in their statements. I will use the Comext data for this.</p>
      <p sl="en">EU imports of tomatoes from Morocco grew from 185 000 tonnes in the 1999-2000 season to 295 000 tonnes in 2009-2010, following the normal trend of fresh fruit and vegetable imports from all over the world. At the same time, total additional EU imports of tomatoes increased from 242 000 tonnes to 493 000 tonnes. I have to underline that Morocco’s share of total EU imports actually decreased from 76% to 59%. EU tomato production varies between 16 and 18 million tonnes per year, of which 6.5 to 7.5 million tonnes are destined for the fresh market. I think that it is very good to bear these figures in mind so that we can keep this discussion and the size of the problem in proportion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the new agreement with Morocco, we in the Commission believe that it is modest and balanced. If it is adopted, the Commission will, of course, ensure that all its conditions and rules are fully respected. Additional quantities under the tariff rate quota will be kept below the traditional average of supplies to the EU. The current average annual level is 300 000 tonnes. With an additional 52 000 tonnes, there will be 285 000 tonnes within the tariff rate quota, so there will still be scope for 15 000 tonnes of imports under the usual erga omnes regime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Turning to another problem raised, namely, the claim that we failed to act, I really cannot accept that because we did not find any systemic failure in the system. There was one case that was also presented here today in which OLAF investigated the problem and referred the whole file with the findings to the French court, which did not support the full extent of OLAF’s findings, but nevertheless, the partial recovery of unpaid duties has started.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to assure this House that, regarding control of phytosanitary standards, the Commission is assuring the highest possible control and the highest possible level of standards for every import of fresh fruit and vegetables to the European Union. At the same time, I have to say that I understand the vigilance of the Members of the European Parliament and the vigilance of the agricultural sector on these very pertinent issues. I would like to assure them that, if the organisations have concrete evidence of fraud, they are invited to bring this to the attention of the Commission, which will carefully analyse it and take appropriate action if needed.</p>

      <p sl="it">As far as the content is concerned, there is no conflict between the Commission, Parliament and the Council.

      <p sl="fi">This resolution divided opinions right across Parliament. It should not be a matter of whether we are against or in favour of nuclear power: we insist on minimum standards of safety for Europe as a whole. The stress tests proposed by the Commission will not be enough on their own to pacify the public. The Commission should investigate alternative energy solutions for the future, at the same time taking into consideration the different energy needs of the EU Member States. In my opinion, investing in nuclear power should not mean that there is less research or product development in the area of renewable energy sources.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the disaster in Fukushima has given rise to justified public fears over the use of nuclear energy, and it is therefore appropriate to think about the current situation in the EU, and to take decisive steps to improve safety, with which I agree, as well as transparency in the operation of nuclear plants and the protection of human health. In the current situation, it is not possible, with the best will in the world, to imagine a functioning, competitive electricity market without the contribution of nuclear energy in a balanced energy mix, whether we like it or not.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EU and the Member States have a duty to create an energy policy that will ensure the sovereignty, political independence and economic security of every state. The instruments for achieving this objective include a suitable energy mix, an adequate level of production capacity, a balance between supply and demand, reductions in the energy intensity of the economy and so on.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am not afraid of emphasising that nuclear energy is an important resource for electricity generation, because it contributes to greater energy security, particularly for states with limited reserves of solid fuels. I abstained from the final vote because it included a proposal to put through a moratorium on new reactors. I certainly disagree with that.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I voted in favour of the amendment insisting on a nuclear-free future for Europe. The tragedy of Fukushima underlines the huge danger that nuclear power represents for humanity and for the environment. The potential for massive catastrophe and the lack of a safe way to dispose of spent nuclear fuel means that nuclear power does not represent a safe means to develop energy production.</p>
      <p sl="en">The tragedy also underlines the fact that private profiteers cannot be trusted with the vital task of energy production and energy distribution. Ultimately, the capitalist pursuit of profit, without regard for human life, human safety or the environment, is responsible for this crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call for the nationalisation of the energy sector under democratic worker control and management. On that basis, we could develop a rational and sustainable plan for energy production, distribution and use, to provide cheap and safe energy for all, while protecting the environment. At the centre of that plan, there must be a long-term programme of investment in renewable energy sources leading to the progressive replacement of oil, gas, coal and nuclear power stations.</p>

Nuclear power is once more in the spotlight, and I believe we need to think above all of the future, of our children’s future. It is true that we need energy, but we need clean energy and safe energy. Safety is all well and good, but it is not enough. A moratorium is not enough; we need to go further than that.</p>
      <p sl="it">The tragedy of Fukushima tells us that there is no such thing as zero-risk nuclear power stations. Above all, it tells us that we need to organise a rapid exit from nuclear power and to focus our attention on renewable, alternative power sources. Europe needs a new energy policy in order to halt the construction of new nuclear power stations because of the terrible impact these power stations could have on safety, the environment, the climate and future generations. A radical change of perspective is necessary, for a safe future based on saving energy and the use of renewable sources.</p>

      <p sl="en">As a result of the world’s most severe earthquake recorded in that area, there will be an estimated 30 000 to 40 000 deaths due to destroyed roads, bridges, railway lines and buildings. Should we demolish all similar structures in the EU, just in case? That is my question.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nuclear technology is not at fault in Japan; the location is.

Now, though, we need to remember that just one out of 54 nuclear power plants did not get through the test to which the tsunami and earthquake subjected them.</p>

Human rights are one key area; they must be exported to the Middle East. We really need to present a concept and understanding of what human rights mean.

      <p sl="pt">Bluetongue is a disease that mainly affects ruminant animals such as sheep, goats and cows, and may take the form of an epidemic if the environmental and climatic conditions are favourable to it, particularly in late summer and early autumn. Although there is no record of any human being infected, it is vital to recognise this disease and seek to implement measures that will eradicate it. At EU level, this disease was first seen in the south, and then in the centre and north of Europe. Thanks to successive vaccination campaigns cofinanced by the EU, the use of certain vaccines may not eradicate the disease, but allow it to continue to circulate. A type of vaccine was therefore developed that ensures the control and prevention of this disease in the EU, but the use of which is restricted under current rules. A change to the current directive is therefore needed. Given that this proposal for an amendment to the Parliament and Council Directive 2000/75/EC complies with the Animal Health strategy (2007-2013) and points towards a more flexible approach in the vaccination system, thereby contributing to improved control of major animal diseases, I am voting in favour.</p>

Since the early 2000s, several epidemic waves of disease have occurred in many Member States, including central and northern Europe, causing significant losses in terms of morbidity, mortality and disruption of trade in live animals. Hitherto, the provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue have been based on experience of the use of live attenuated vaccines that were the only vaccines available. Those vaccines may lead to undesired circulation of the vaccine virus in unvaccinated animals. In the last few years, however, new inactivated vaccines have become available. Unlike the ‘live attenuated vaccines’, these inactivated vaccines do not pose the risk of undesired vaccine virus circulation and can therefore be successfully used outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions. This proposal would relax some restrictions, which have become unnecessary in light of the recent developments in vaccine production. The new rules would help Member States to make more effective use of vaccination to control bluetongue and reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As a result of technical innovation, newer vaccinations against bluetongue have appeared on the market which were unavailable when the Commission was drawing up its directive. This is why I am supporting the rapporteur’s view that the regulations governing vaccinations should be updated, which will make it easier for animal breeders to produce healthy animals. Making the regulations more flexible and liberalising them will allow for more effective breeding, and, above all, will make the protection of animals against unwanted and dangerous diseases more effective. I also fully support this initiative from the point of view of its nature, as, in order to make the legal system more effective, we should simplify it as much as possible and make it more flexible, and the above report fulfils this aim.</p>

      <p sl="de">Bluetongue is a horrible animal epidemic affecting ruminants that has caused great damage throughout the livestock sector. The economic damage and the losses resulting from the trade coming to a standstill are hitting the farming sector hard. In Austria, too, where cattle breeding has a long tradition, many farmers have found their livelihoods threatened. It is now important to implement supporting measures and revise the old regulation before the next epidemic breaks out. The rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers. I welcome the rapid action at EU level and advocate the fast implementation of the new directive. As a representative of the farming community, I know how important it is to think in terms of the annual cycle. Making a decision quickly will allow us to have a usable and uniform ruling by the autumn, which is in the interests of the Member States and, above all, of those that keep animals.</p>

      <p sl="it">Bluetongue is a disease affecting ruminants. Since the early 2000s, it has caused significant losses of animals affected by the disease. Europe intervened with Council Directive 2000/75/EC to deal with the problem through provisions regulating the use of ‘attenuated vaccines’, in order to effectively combat the consequences of the phenomenon. The vaccines used hitherto, which were those to which the aforementioned directive applied, led to the risk of transmission of the virus to unvaccinated animals, which is the reason why vaccination was only allowed in specially designated zones. Unlike the ones on the market at the time Council Directive 2000/75/EC was introduced, the new vaccines available are ‘inactivated vaccines’, and do not pose this kind of risk. I voted in favour of this report because the new provisions will allow Member States to control the phenomenon, thus reducing the negative impact of this disease on a large number of European livestock farmers. I hope that this will help enable the urgent measures to be adopted as soon as possible within the next few months.</p>

One of these is bluetongue, of which there have been repeated epidemics in Northern Europe since 2000 and which can cause particularly great damage. Cattle and sheep are particularly badly affected by the disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted by the gnat, a type of midge. An illness has also been observed in goats, but the course of the disease is far less dramatic in these than in the case of other species. The possibility of vaccination was first permitted in 2000, but was subject to strict rules since untreated animals could also have been infected by the viruses through the vaccine.</p>

The new law ushers in the use of a new bluetongue vaccine for the first time, which takes advantage of developments in science since the previous rules came into force. The new vaccine will be an ‘inactivated’ jab and will allay farmers’ fears over the traditional ‘live’ vaccines. The EPLP is delighted that the EU has brought in this new law, which has real benefits for farmers in the UK. It reassures farmers who are concerned by the deadly disease and the existing vaccination as the bluetongue season approaches with the warmer weather. Farmers will now have a new and safer vaccine available and will be given greater powers over their own vaccination programmes. Until now, farmers would have lost the right to vaccinate their animals if the UK was declared entirely free from bluetongue. But under the new law, farmers are given the power to keep vaccinating for their own peace of mind, whilst profiting from easier exports.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Fukushima nuclear disaster has had a series of repercussions on European political life. The first lesson that the EU has drawn from the Japanese catastrophe has been to take prompt action to tighten safety checks at nuclear power installations by means of stress tests.

I believe that none of us would wish to relive the Chernobyl disaster of 26 April 1986.</p>

That means that nuclear installations which do not conform to the standards, which continue to fail to make the grade, should be closed down.

These should show the extent to which the power plants are capable of withstanding similar disasters. A similar situation to the one in Japan could happen anywhere in Europe. It is therefore also desirable to have more stringent monitoring of safety systems at nuclear power plants, strengthening their weak aspects and eliminating any deficiencies. It is in the interest of individual countries, and also within their capabilities, to look for a solution to the nuclear issue – whether through safety improvements, or complete decommissioning. Cooperation at the European level, however, is essential. Although Europe is not threatened by giant tsunami waves, there is the threat in the 21st century of, for example, terrorist attacks, attacks by computer hackers on nuclear power plant systems and so on. From a security perspective, the extent to which power plants can counter such potential threats is very much open to question.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I did not support the resolution, firstly because it did not contribute anything positive in addition to bans, restrictions and a general aversion to nuclear technology. Secondly, it does not indicate any way out of a completely new situation for energy policy as a whole. For example, points 19, 20 and 21 could have introduced new ideas and orientations in terms of integrated thinking about energy efficiency, especially efficiency with regard to energy from primary sources, of which we have the greatest reserves, especially fossil fuels. Thirdly, the radical suggestions it contains require a national referendum, which, in my country, is to take place at the initiative of the left-wing parties. Maybe such a referendum ought to be carried out at EU level. Fourthly, my country, as a result of the EU’s misguided regulations to date, has been forced to halt essential investments in coal power stations, and now the same lobby is saying that we need to halt investments in nuclear technology. So what is left? The resolution points only to energy from renewable sources. In my country, the total capacity of these resources would cover 13%, to a maximum of 20%, of essential needs. Maybe in Sweden the situation is different, as it has large reserves of hydropower, but not in Poland. The case of Fukushima requires a review of the whole of the European Union’s current energy policy.</p>

I do not remember the communists being so virulent after 1986’s Chernobyl disaster. It is true, then: there is no such thing as ‘zero risk’ where nuclear power is concerned. There is no such thing as zero risk in life full stop. We must do all we can to minimise that risk. For the moment, however, we do not have any credible alternatives. Forcing the Member States urgently to abandon that energy source, to stop building new plants and to shut the others, is completely at odds with the outright rejection of fossil energy, on the pretext that its use would contribute to global warming.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Nuclear energy or fossil energy: you may favour one over the other, but you cannot rule them both out. Neither hydropower nor today’s alternative energy sources are capable of meeting our supply needs.

Furthermore, like everyone else in the French socialist delegation, I supported the amendments in favour of a carefully planned and prepared phasing-out of nuclear power, reflecting the fight against global warming. That phasing-out of nuclear power will have to go hand in hand with increased investment in research and innovation, in order to reduce our energy dependence and increase the number of renewable forms of energy in the energy mix of the EU Member States. I did, however, vote against the motion as a whole, because it was merely a juxtaposition of viewpoints forming an inconsistent motion. After such a disastrous event as Fukushima, the question of the future of a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy requires more than a hastily put together resolution.

I share the concerns expressed in this motion for a resolution that the development of new nuclear projects in Belarus and Russia (the Kaliningrad oblast) gives rise to serious concerns about nuclear safety standards and compliance with the obligations contained in international conventions, and that Europeans, Member States and the European Commission must respond to these concerns in a spirit of solidarity.

Significant material damage has also been done and the consequences will have long-term implications for people’s health. Even now, we still feel the consequences of Chernobyl, and therefore today, we must reassess our approach to nuclear safety in the EU and the rest of the world. As for improving nuclear projects, in Belarus and Kaliningrad, there are huge problems surrounding nuclear safety standards, and compliance with the appropriate obligations in international conventions, because these problems are not just a matter for the Member States that share borders with these regions, but for the whole of Europe, and EU entities and the European Commission must act together, under the subsidiarity principle. The resolution on the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region and the role of macro-regions in the future cohesion policy states that given the planned development of nuclear energy in the Baltic Sea region, the EU Member States must comply with the most stringent standards of safety and environmental protection, and the European Commission must monitor and check whether neighbouring countries on the EU’s external borders follow the same approach and international conventions. Nuclear power plants under construction near the EU’s external borders must comply with international nuclear safety and environmental protection standards. Today, energy efficiency and energy saving, renewable and sustainable energy, and the introduction of Europe-wide electrical energy networks, have become particularly important.

Following on from warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency on the state of now obsolete nuclear power installations, it would seem necessary to identify measures able to assess safety levels at installations. Collaboration and coordination between Member States are crucial, as crises of this type have repercussions not only for the countries in which they are built, but also on a more widespread level. The events that have taken place show that, in order to prevent disasters on this scale, Europe has to implement a series of very stringent measures in order to assess existing safety levels.

      <p sl="nl">We have not reached any agreement today on this resolution, which was intended to draw lessons from the nuclear disaster in Fukushima. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has, for years, advocated the phasing out of nuclear power, because the risks to humans and the environment are unacceptably high and because there are more than enough alternatives. Fukushima, in particular, has demonstrated that. It is sad that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe continue to believe in their nuclear dreams, even if, as has now been made clear by Japan and Chernobyl, they will ultimately end in nightmares. Despite this, there are still many people who are reluctant to wake up from their bad nuclear dream.</p>

A majority in this House appears not to understand that it is perfectly technically and economically feasible, over a period of forty years, to generate our electricity completely sustainably through such measures as energy efficiency and reliance on the sun, wind, geothermal energy, water and biomass.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this European Parliament resolution on the lessons to be drawn for nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan, as its objective is to increase nuclear safety in the EU and not to ban the production and use of nuclear energy. This is why I voted against all the amendments aimed at removing nuclear energy from Europe’s energy mix. Although I did not vote for imposing a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear reactors, I felt that, if such a moratorium were imposed, it ought to be limited only to the period of the ‘stress test’ which nuclear reactors in the EU will be undergoing. This would allow the construction of new reactors to benefit from the conclusions of the stress tests, ensuring that nuclear safety will increase.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the moment, nuclear energy accounts for 30% of Europe’s energy mix. The European Union depends, to a large extent, on Member States’ energy mix to fulfil its ‘20-20-20’ target. We cannot decide to get rid of nuclear energy without establishing what sustainable energy sources will be available which can meet the EU’s energy demand in the years ahead, at prices which citizens can afford. The EU must invest in energy efficiency measures, particularly in buildings and transport, as well as in the use of renewable energy sources.</p>

      <p sl="en">The nuclear crisis in Japan set into motion a number of ideas that amount to an irrational tsunami. Nuclear energy is now demonised and there is growing pressure demanding a complete switch from nuclear to so-called alternative sources of energy. But this school of thought is bordering on outright superstition. The nuclear reactor of Fukushima was hit by an unprecedented combination of catastrophes. This proves that nature is unpredictable and that tsunamis cannot be banned, but it does not prove that nuclear energy is at fault. Nuclear energy has a much safer record than any other source of energy. While oil arguably generates exploitation, dependence, wars and dictatorships, nuclear energy is historically much safer. Our main concern with nuclear energy should indeed be risk assessment and unitary safety procedures at a European level. With these criteria fulfilled and observed, nuclear energy could put an end or severely limit the politics of energy dependence. And while natural disasters cannot be prevented, nuclear energy is not a serious risk per se. The real danger does not come from well serviced nuclear reactors, but from nuclear reactors under the wrong political control. In other words, look at Iran, not Japan.</p>

Nuclear power is a vital source of energy across Europe, with some Member States getting as much as 75% of their electricity from nuclear power, and a review of the safety of nuclear power plants should be a priority, including stress tests on existing plants. This should not, however, lead to closures of existing power plants where there are no safety concerns or prevent the opening of new nuclear installations to replace out-of-date plants. We need a grown-up debate on these issues to ensure that there is a balanced mix of renewable and other low carbon sources of energy to ensure that the lights stay on across Europe.</p>

Moreover, the close ties between Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the religious tensions between the Sunnis and Alawites in Syria, should make us exercise caution because there is a huge risk that the escalation in violence will also push Syria towards civil war, with outside interference.

In addition to the existing challenges, the situation in the LDCs has been exacerbated by the recent global financial, food, climate change and energy crises. Therefore, this UN conference should be result-oriented, on the basis of clear indicators and the objective of reducing the number of LDCs by half by 2020, combined with efficient and transparent monitoring and follow-up mechanisms.</p>

      <p sl="pt">It is deplorable that 48 countries are currently classified as least developed countries (LDCs), and that 75% of the 800 million inhabitants of these countries live on less than USD 2 per day. The long-term goal for development cooperation should be that of creating the conditions for sustainable economic development, and the fair redistribution of wealth. Peace and security are vital to the effectiveness of development policy, and the EU should coordinate its approach better, with the aim of resolving stability problems in the LDCs and supporting efforts to build the capacities needed for the construction of peaceful, democratic and inclusive states. It is also essential to give priority to food security, to agriculture, to infrastructure, to capacity building, and, in particular, to economic growth and access to technology, as well as to the human and social development of the LDCs.</p>

      <p sl="ro">With the previous conferences having focused on principles, I hope that the fourth UN conference will be geared towards determining results and devising clear indicators for halving the number of less developed countries by 2020. Out of the 51 underdeveloped countries, where 78% of the population live on less than USD 1.25 a day, only three have moved out of this category in recent years. The situation is worrying as these countries are the most vulnerable to ordeals such as the financial and food crises and climate change, while also facing extreme poverty, a lack of infrastructure and rising unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This reality highlights that, unfortunately, the international community has not fulfilled the commitments set out in the Brussels Action Programme.

It is only fair to mention the exceptional circumstances in Cape Verde, as the adopted resolution does, as the country has succeeded, despite a lack of resources, in overcoming some of the difficulties that it faced, and improving its population’s living conditions. I would therefore congratulate the Cape Verdean people, their government and their parties on this, as they have been able to take action in a responsible and respectable manner: this Portuguese-speaking country is today an example to be followed by the LDCs. Despite limitations on trade and problems with training and access to information, to resources and to units of production, it cannot be emphasised enough that the underdevelopment of the LDCs results mainly from their decision makers’ lack of skill and their institutions’ inefficiency, as their people are so capable in other respects.</p>

The EU, which has always led the way in supporting developing countries through poverty eradication programmes – for which financial allocations have trebled over the last few years – is very involved in the organisation of this meeting. Parliament will also be represented by a delegation delivering well thought-out proposals, although its observer status will not allow it great visibility, and I hope that this represents a significant boost in winning the ‘battle’ of sustainable development and equitable growth for these countries. Given that all countries have responsibilities for supporting the least developed countries (LDCs), in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, I agree with the proposals included in this joint motion for a resolution, and I would like to see the goal of halving the number of LDCs by 2020 achieved.

With regard to development policy, the disparity between the EU’s words and actions is clear. We have the resources at our disposal to eradicate poverty. These are even increased by the benefits of scientific and technological development. Nonetheless, what we are seeing is an increase in poverty at global level. This is the result of the system that dominates the world: capitalism, which is intrinsically unfair and unequal. We would emphasise the importance of the alternative resolution tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, as well as the amendments tabled to the joint resolution – and unfortunately rejected by the majority – that focus on, inter alia , issues such as: food sovereignty, agricultural development, and the need to put an end to the EU’s blackmailing of a number of developing countries on the basis of so-called Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>

I welcome the EU’s attempt to participate actively at the top-level UN conference, and I expect concrete commitments from this. During the past 10 years, the poorest countries have recorded greater progress than in the previous decade. Despite this, however, many problems persist: increasing dependence on imported goods, poverty, the low level of human capital and vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. These problems must be resolved from all sides, but two points are particularly important. First, these countries have to get investment flowing into the productive sectors of the economy. Secondly, it is necessary to help build democratic structures in these countries, enabling them to decide independently on strategic priorities without foreign interference. Commodity market fluctuations and the consequences arising from these are a specific issue that must be resolved. From the long-term perspective, the answer is to diversify the economy. From the short-term and medium-term perspective, it is important to control price shocks, especially in the area of foodstuffs. With regard to the position of the EU, it is important to focus on coherent external policies. The Commission document of 16 February is exhaustive, but it must take a more critical approach. We need to acknowledge that not all EU activities in the area of trade or direct foreign investments are in line with development policy. In my opinion, they should be subordinated to it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There are currently 48 least developed countries (LDCs), which means that every fifth country in the world falls into this category. The category of LDC was created by the UN General Assembly in the early 1970s, which was more than 40 years ago. Since then, the number of LDCs has increased twofold, and only three (Botswana, Maldives and Cape Verde) have been able to graduate from the group. This shows that poverty is spreading, and the effectiveness of activities undertaken so far is barely perceptible. The critical situation has been exacerbated further by the economic crisis. Its effects have affected LDCs to a large extent and caused a further deepening of the problems occurring there. These arise, in particular, from debt, high food and fuel prices and climate change. I therefore supported the resolution on the Fourth United Nations conference on LDCs with full conviction and awareness of its importance.</p>
      <p sl="pl">There is a need for a deep, comprehensive analysis and diagnosis of the situation of LDCs and concrete proposals for solutions aimed at improving the living conditions of the citizens of these countries in the short term, and at leaving the group in the long term.

And yet it is by working towards a better distribution of wealth, supporting LDCs on the path to growth and democracy, and combating the frenzied speculation on commodity prices, that these extremely vulnerable countries will be able to escape the vicious circle of poverty.

It is not because I dispute Iceland’s right to enter the European Union; it is because I believe that it is not a good idea for it to join. Indeed, the vast majority of people in Iceland seem to hold the same view. The decision to apply for membership was taken in a moment of panic, following the collapse of the Icelandic banking system, in order to benefit from European support.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Everyone knows that Iceland wants to adopt the euro without being a member of the European Union, which is stupid when we know what implications that has, and that Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area and of the Schengen area. It will be up to the Icelandic people to decide in the end, anyway. And I hope that if they do say no, they will be heard.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this document, because accession negotiations with Iceland were launched in July 2010 and it is essential to create the conditions to complete the accession process with Iceland and ensure that its accession is a success. Iceland can bring a valuable contribution to EU policies due to its experience in the field of renewable energies, particularly as regards the utilisation of geothermal energy, protection of the environment and measures to deal with climate change. Iceland’s accession to the EU would enhance the Union’s prospects of playing a more active and constructive role in Northern Europe and in the Arctic, contributing to multilateral governance and sustainable policy solutions in the region. It is also crucial to give EU citizens clear and comprehensive fact-based information on the implications of Iceland’s accession. Efforts must be made to that end, and I believe it is equally important to listen to and address citizens’ concerns and questions and to respond to their views and interests.</p>

      <p sl="it">I had to give my wholehearted support to the resolution on the 2010 progress report on Iceland put to the vote in Parliament. In the year just gone, Iceland demonstrated its willingness to comply on many fronts with European policy and with the principles that inspire it. Its strong civic and democratic tradition, the progress made in strengthening the independence of the judiciary, and the particular attention paid to the economic aspect, which is increasingly on course to meet the criteria laid down by Europe, make it a country whose accession to the EU can only be considered positively, not least because it would strengthen the Union’s role within the Arctic Council. The safeguarding of human rights, the strengthening of the legislative environment with regard to freedom of expression and access to information, and the high rates of investment in education, research and development, aimed at tackling the high level of youth unemployment, demonstrate the industriousness of the country and its firm desire to align itself with Europe. It will be up to the people of Iceland to have the final say: they will have to vote in a referendum, and I hope that they will opt in favour of joining our great European family.</p>

A lack of dialogue between the government and opposition parties in the country is preventing an agreement on the implementation of structural reforms from being reached.

So far, Greece has proved itself to be a trustworthy discussion partner with regard to the other chapters.

All the key players and parties concerned should step up their efforts and demonstrate responsibility and determination to solve all outstanding issues which are not only hindering the accession process of the candidate country, and the EU’s own policy in the region, but could also have repercussions on inter-ethnic relations, regional stability and economic development. The document urges the authorities responsible to strengthen the independence and freedom of the media, applying equal standards to all of them and improving the transparency of their ownership.

Macedonia has made significant progress in the democratisation of the state, due directly to the political will to become a full member of the family of European nations. The European Commission has evaluated this progress and, for the second year running now, has called upon the European Council to open accession negotiations with Macedonia. Also for the second year running, the Council has not taken this decision. This gives rise to the impression that one of the unfounded obstacles to the opening of these negotiations are mutual bones of contention, including relations with Greece. These disputes must not block the accession process for Macedonia, all the more so since continuing the accession process would promote stability and strengthen yet further the dialogue between the ethnic communities in Macedonia.</p>

According to UN sources, hundreds of lives have been lost in Côte d’Ivoire since December 2010 and the actual number of casualties is likely to be much higher, as the violence taking place in the interior of the country is not always reported in the press.

I agree with the need for swift international political action to address the humanitarian situation in Côte d’Ivoire and prevent a new migration crisis in the region. The Commission and the Member States must coordinate their efforts with other international donors in order to respond to the urgent needs of the population of Côte d’Ivoire and its neighbouring countries.

This is the case with the way in which natural disasters are managed, for instance. Interventions in emergency situations are extremely difficult if the neighbouring countries do not have the capacity to respond, and no region can respond to the whole situation on its own. This is why I have proposed that the regions located at the EU border, which have borders with at least two non-EU states, should be regarded as ‘platform’ regions and supported accordingly.

Challenges still remain, however, and the focus should now be on the priorities for action, with more effective benchmarks, in particular, as regards the Eastern Partnership. The partnership with our Eastern neighbours represents a political framework of great importance for Europe’s wellbeing, and its work platform is focused on four themes: democracy, good governance, economic integration and convergence with European policies. Unfortunately, at this time, the conflicts that have arisen in these countries are seriously undermining their economic, social and political development, and constitute a serious obstacle to cooperation and regional security, as shown by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.

Since the creation of the ENP, progress has been noticeable in the field of human rights, the democratisation of public life and economic reforms in many partner countries.

      <p sl="pl">The resolution of the European Parliament on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is to meet the challenges that have emerged in recent months in our neighbourhood, both in the Eastern and the Southern Dimension. These events have demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing EU involvement in the neighbourhood. The paradigm shift proposed by the European Parliament from ‘stability first’ to ‘democratisation and human rights first’ in EU policy is necessary. There should be no more pretending that the political status quo, i.e. maintaining authoritarian regimes, is better for Europe and its security. The time has come for solidarity with our neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the differences, most countries in the neighbourhood share common characteristics: limited freedom, or no freedom at all, and a lack of success in modernisation. The allocation of additional, generous funds in order to build a stable EU neighbourhood seems unavoidable. The ENP should therefore continue to be founded on the principle of conditionality, bilateral and multilateral cooperation and should be extended by the pursuit of institutional integration, liberalisation of the visa regime, opening up the European market and support for civil society. It is worth recalling again the position of Poland, the advocate of the EU’s successive enlargements, which urged the Member States two years ago, in partnership with Sweden, to strengthen the Eastern Dimension of the ENP in the form of the Eastern Partnership initiative.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the face of current events, Poland’s role takes on a symbolic meaning. Poland, which has historical experience in transformation of its political-economic system, may serve as a good guide and model for both eastern and southern EU neighbours in the current policy.</p>

However, it is vital to review and point out the mistakes of the past. The review of the ENP and the Eastern Partnership should set out priorities for specific action from each partner, along with benchmarks and differentiation based on performance and the results achieved.

The EU’s goals are very broad and are based on an extension to neighbouring countries in order to create a large area for the free movement of people and goods. In these circumstances, the EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has a vital role in its strategy for development and growth. Several instruments and resolutions have been adopted to this end, particularly the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and the crucial choices of the common foreign and security policy. However, the review of the ENP now has a greater importance in the context of the events in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. The EU should draw lessons from the events in the south, particularly in Tunisia and Egypt, and revise its democracy and human rights support policy so as to create an implementation mechanism for the human rights clauses in all agreements with third countries.

The EU has two tools at its disposal: the Union for the Mediterranean and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.

Women who have actively participated in the uprisings for more democracy, rights and freedoms in North Africa and the Middle East deserve our respect and support. The European Union cannot be silent when these brave fighters for democracy and freedom are cruelly treated. We therefore call on the Commission and the Member State governments to strongly oppose the use of sexual assaults, intimidation and targeting of women in Libya and Egypt, because these countries’ incumbent regimes have resorted to sexual violence against women as a weapon in the conflicts that arose during these revolutions. The Egyptian authorities must take urgent steps to end torture, investigate all cases of abuse against peaceful demonstrators, and stop prosecuting civilians before military tribunals.

      <p sl="it">It goes further than that, however: no one has the right to violate the dignity of women merely because they have the courage to demand the right to express their thoughts, actively participating in the construction of a peaceful and democratic world and demanding, above all, the right to gender equality. Inflicting inhumane and degrading treatment, such as electric shocks, ‘virginity tests’, physical and psychological violence, rape and slavery, is an unacceptable practice to which we must say ‘Enough’.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as the events in these North African countries are concerned, it is only right that the people responsible for these serious violations be punished, as in any other conflict in the world, because we are dealing here not just with civilians but, what is more reprehensible still, also with soldiers.

One significant case is that of a Libyan woman who, in March, told some journalists in a Tripoli hotel that she had been a victim of gang rape by soldiers.

Mass sexual violence against women is a permanent part of armed conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) gives, among others, the example of Kenya, a relatively stable country, in which pre-election riots led to a doubling of the number of victims of sexual violence in a matter of days.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Sexual violence is becoming an epidemic. In fact, it has become one of the tactics of war. The European Union must not remain neutral on this issue. It is therefore essential to include gender mainstreaming in the mainstream of European Neighbourhood Policy and in the centre of our efforts towards creating an effective and structured approach to gender equality in the countries covered by the policy. Human rights, an inseparable element of which is the equality of men and women, should constitute an essential element of democratic processes in third countries. It is shocking that despite the prevalence of sexual violence in Africa, governments do not include fighting it among their priorities, as we can see, for example, in the case of South Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The EU should focus its efforts specifically on women.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. The European Investment Bank plays a critical role in supporting SMEs, particularly during this financial crisis and economic downturn. Given the huge importance of SMEs to the European economy, it was agreed that from 2008 to 2011, SMEs should receive loans totalling over EUR 30 billion. The European Progress Microfinance Facility was set up in March 2010 with some EUR 200 million in funding from the Commission and the Bank. However, SMEs still face difficulties trying to obtain credit. As stated in the Bank Watch report, SMEs, particularly those in Central and Eastern European Member States, are unable to take advantage of the assistance intended for them. The EIB must lay down clear financing conditions and more strict lending effectiveness criteria for its financial intermediaries providing loans. National financial intermediaries were given a period of two years to provide loans, but as the report states, some financial intermediaries granted only a small portion of the loans or did not grant any at all, although the financial resources were in their accounts. Furthermore, the EIB’s website still lacks publicly available data regarding the use and beneficiaries of allocated funding. I believe that the EIB must enhance transparency in its lending through financial intermediaries and report annually on its lending to SMEs, including an evaluation of the accessibility and effectiveness of this and lists of loan beneficiaries.</p>

I also believe that the commitment to the idea of project bonds, which is aimed at enhancing the credit rating of bonds issued by companies themselves, and where these bonds are used to finance European transport, energy and IT infrastructures, is a positive step. At this point, it is desirable that both the Commission and the EIB should submit concrete proposals for project bonds. It is also worth highlighting the important work that the EIB may carry out under the EU 2020 strategy, by simplifying procedures and maximising multiplier factors in order to attract public and private sector investors. With regard to EIB financing outside the EU, I believe that a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the EIB, the EBRD and the Commission is desirable, so as to strengthen cooperation in all the countries where they operate, with the dual aim of making their lending policies both consistent with one another and consistent with the EU’s political objectives.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Investment Bank (EIB) currently plays an irreplaceable role in providing finance in the EU and elsewhere. The submitted report takes a positive view of the fact that the EIB acted correctly in supporting SMEs in the EU during the crisis. It is true that the bank formally committed EUR 30 billion over a four-year period to supporting SMEs. However, the problem is that not all of the money even reached the SMEs. In specific terms, only about half of the funds committed reached SMEs in the V4 region in the first period. The EIB gave banks an inexplicably long period of two years to distribute the funds, and also failed to stipulate any sanctions against banks in the event that this deadline was not met. The banks of Central Europe, hard hit by the crisis, were only too pleased to ‘hold on to’ these funds. What was billed as support for SMEs therefore became, in reality, support for the Central European branches of foreign banks. There is reason enough to think that this was not by accident, but by design.</p>
      <p sl="sk">To conclude briefly – the EIB is also having problems in the area of development. It needs to take on more employees specialised in development. The EIB is currently under-staffed, despite its impact on so-called developing countries.

      <p sl="hu">I welcome the fact that the European Parliament appraises the annual report of the European Investment Bank (EIB), albeit from a distinctly bird’s-eye view. The EIB is playing a decisive role in fighting the crisis. For me, however, the issues of transparency and measurable results remain doubtful. The EIB’s activity focuses on the three areas where the crisis hit hardest: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), convergence regions and climate action. SMEs play a key role in the recovery of the European economy and the fight against unemployment, and therefore it would be expedient to make it easier for them to access the capital required for developments. In this respect, it would be useful if we could see an assessment of the accessibility and effectiveness of the loans in question every year, which would ensure the transparency of the final purpose of the loans and improve the administrative process. Also in this respect, I believe it is vitally important that the EIB updates and tightens its policy on offshore financial centres.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The EIB plays a very important role in enhancing the European Union’s convergence, and due to the technical aid and cofinancing offered by it, the regions under the convergence objectives are able to use an ever larger proportion of the funds available to them. For this reason, I believe that further increasing this role is practical and to be supported.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Lastly, I suggest that the proposal that transparent regulatory supervision should be introduced in the interests of the quality of the EIB’s financial situation, the precise measurement of its results, and compliance with effective and successful business practice, deserves consideration.</p>

      <p sl="it">The document that has been approved today highlights the clear need for additional support by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in areas strategic to the recovery of the European economy: small and medium-sized enterprises, midcaps and infrastructure and other key growth- and employment-enhancing projects as part of the Europe 2020 strategy. The report urges the EIB to invest in freight transport in the European railway sector as well as in other Trans-European Networks of freight transport with a focus on the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea ports, in order to link them definitively to European markets. The EIB should, moreover, provide more support for the building of the TEN-T network, with the aim of generating a leverage effect for more investment, from both the public and the private sector. In order to achieve this objective, project bonds can act as a complementary investment instrument alongside the budget in the TEN-T fund.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this is the first time that I have participated in a Thursday afternoon debate, so there are some lessons I think I can pick up for the Conference of Presidents with regard to making the plenary session more attractive.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased that this point has been put on the agenda, because the case of Mr Ai Weiwei is quite dramatic, as the latest information we have is that there is certainly no intention on the part of the Chinese authorities to release him. The best thing we can do is to approve the urgent resolution we have agreed together with all the groups so that we can increase pressure on the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have to tell you that I have my doubts that this resolution will change anything in the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese authorities. What we are, in fact, doing on human rights with the Chinese is a game. We are talking about human rights, they are saying they will open a dialogue and we think that things have changed. Nothing shall change. That is the reality. We have the Nobel prize-winner who could not attend the meeting in Oslo. We now have Mr Ai Weiwei, who is a well-known artist and was one of the last dissidents who had the possibility to say something.</p>
      <p sl="en">The only thing we can say is in an urgent resolution in which we deplore what is happening. In any case, I had hoped that we could ask why we should continue to participate in fora that the Chinese Communist Party organises with our political parties. I deplore that there was not enough support from the other groups to come to an agreement on that. We could at least have agreed on a principle of not continuing to participate in fora with the Chinese Communist Party, if Mr Weiwei and other dissidents were not released. For that reason at least, I hoped for the support of all the groups here – with the other amendment the Greens tabled, even if the best part of it was eliminated. Yes, it is true, they tabled a fantastic amendment and then eliminated the best part! OK, it was not their fault, but apparently the fault of others.</p>
      <a text="(Interruption by the President)"/>
      <p sl="en">I may be taking a minute more than I usually do, but for Mr Ai Weiwei, it will take ten years longer, apparently. If we can speak in favour of somebody who may be in gaol for years, one minute longer is not too much, Mr President!</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I vividly recall the first time that I saw a work by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. At that time, in about 2000, I was a lecturer in Art History in Lisbon, and there, in an anthology of modern artists, was his enormous chandelier, the size of a room, overturned and broken. It was at once extremely beautiful and somewhat poignant and sad. This image somehow also reflects an image of China: able to show itself as sumptuous, rich, developed, and capable of presenting itself to the world, as in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. It is a sophisticated China, yet one with something seriously broken inside. That something is the will, free speech and the spirit of the Chinese people themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Today, we have met to discuss the case of the artist Ai Weiwei, and we have asked the Chinese authorities to release him, to let him speak with his lawyer and his wife, and to make any accusations, if there are any which are true, and not charges trumped up on the spot. Above all, we have gathered here to say that this artist’s spirit of creativity, imagination and humour will surely survive much longer than that of his gaolers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, once again, we are debating China, and its government’s intolerance of dissent. As we know from our debate last month on the Communist regime’s vandalism of the ancient city of Kashgar, China vigorously tries to suppress cultural expression that does not conform to what its Communist rulers deem appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ai Weiwei is an heir to China’s magnificent and ancient artistic traditions. He has also used his artistic talents to raise awareness of China’s dismal human rights record and dearth of political freedom. Clearly, there is also a lack of freedom of expression in China. How else can the regime explain Mr Ai’s arrest on economic crimes and because he failed to complete the correct departure procedures for travelling to Taiwan. This is plainly a smokescreen. In fact, the real reason was later elucidated by the state-run Global Times newspaper in a menacing editorial, which said that Mr Ai would pay a price for his resistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">We abhor the Chinese Government’s disgraceful treatment of this distinguished artist. We in this House call for his immediate release, and we express regret, once again, that China goes to such extreme lengths against those who dare speak out for their basic human rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, more than a year ago, we spoke in this Chamber about Liu Xiaobo being sentenced to prison. Here we are now discussing a second signatory of Charter 08 who has been detained by the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As has already been said, Ai Weiwei is not only a very famous artist, but also one of the biggest critics of the Communist regime. He was arrested on Sunday and there is no prospect of his release. Indeed, in addition to this, we saw today that the Chinese authorities maintained that his arrest was an economic and not a political matter, which is blatantly a barefaced lie.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As is well known, Ai Weiwei was prevented from attending the Nobel Prize award ceremony. His arrest is part of a wider trend in cracking down on human rights activists. We have included in our resolution a whole list of people whom, I believe, Lady Ashton must mention whenever she has the opportunity. I believe that we need to reassess our dialogue on human rights more generally.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is no coincidence that the increasingly repressive measures against Chinese journalists, dissidents, human rights activists and lawyers is taking place in the aftermath, or during the turmoil, of the North African revolutions. The word ‘jasmine’ has been banned from the Chinese Internet recently.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s news, which Mr Preda highlighted, is very significant because now, we see how dictators copy from each other and compare notes. We can see that the methods that Russia used against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev have been used by Venezuela and Kazakhstan against businessmen who come too close to political influence, who want to establish opposition parties: they are all punished in the name of economic crimes. Punishment of economic crime is the name they give to political repression. We have to be aware that this has not happened much before in China: this is a turning point that does not bode well.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that Members of the European Parliament raise the persecuted activists’ names when they travel to China and when meeting their Chinese counterparts, and that they insist on a prison visit. We know that many of those who are persecuted suffer terrible torture in Chinese prisons, sometimes in what we call ‘black gaols’ which are completely unidentified places.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a reminder to all European Parliament delegations that all of them are entitled and obliged to exercise their duty in respect of human rights when they visit countries. We call for the immediate release of Ai Weiwei.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The disappearance of Ai Weiwei must be understood within the context of the increasingly desperate political repression carried out by the Chinese authorities. All this is happening due to their fear that the revolutionary spirit of the Arab world will infect Chinese society. However, the EU can make a difference. Violations of human rights by the Chinese authorities must be a constant theme in its political dialogue with China, and this dialogue should be rethought to ensure that there are concrete results, in particular, the review of court rulings that have kept human rights activists in gaol.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Negotiations on the new framework agreement cannot leave aside the issue of human rights, subjugating everything to commercial interests. When pursuing its economic interests, the EU itself has a responsibility to support activists like Ai Weiwei, Liu Xiaobo and Hu Jun, who have fought courageously for urgent political reform in China, against oppression, and for human rights and fundamental freedoms. China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has particular obligations regarding human rights, contained in the UN Charter, and it must be accountable for these not only to its citizens, but also to the rest of the world.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I am very pleased that we in the European Parliament were able to add a current breach of human rights so quickly to the list of urgent petitions.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As we know, the case of Ai Weiwei is not actually the only serious breach of human rights of which the Chinese Communist Party is continually guilty, but, as Mrs Hautala has already previously mentioned here, the democracy movement in China has received a new boost from the uprisings in North Africa.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Over the past few weeks, officials have stepped up their surveillance of critics of the government and many dissidents, activists and human rights lawyers have been either put under house arrest or taken into police custody. As Amnesty International has said, Ai Weiwei’s arrest is an alarming turn of events in the increased incidence of counterblows against dissidents by the Chinese authorities. Economic interests must not now be allowed to blur the issue of human rights and prevent the call for the immediate release of prisoners of conscience.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing’s justification for the arrest of the artist Ai Weiwei for economic crimes is not convincing, and neither is the need to treat a free, dissident artist so harshly. It is not convincing since this arrest is one of hundreds of arrests of opponents and part of the systematic repression of all signs of dissent.</p>
      <p sl="it">At a time when uprisings are breaking out in the Arab world, we think back to the images of cruel violence in Tiananmen Square against young Chinese who, just like today’s Jasmine revolutionaries, were demanding freedom and democracy.</p>
      <p sl="it">China has opened up to the West in economic terms without, however, linking production to respect for the environment and safety at work, and it is unable to embrace democracy and pluralism in any form whatsoever. This is not interference on our part in Chinese internal affairs, as Beijing maintains, but the appeal of men and women, of movements and parties that intend to build a world free of intolerance on every continent.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Beijing government should watch what is happening in the world to grasp that, if it does not change, it will be historic events and Chinese citizens that will change China.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, reports on the worrying human rights situation in the People’s Republic of China have become more and more frequent. In Parliament, we have this issue on our agenda for almost every session. Like the usual cycles of repression, the recent crackdown has already lasted for a while, which might be signalling a power struggle between reformers and hardliners in the Communist Party.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Chinese Government has made it harder to access foreign websites, blocked encryption software used to jump what is colloquially known as ‘the great firewall of China’, obstructed access to Googlemail and intensified arrests, including that of the internationally renowned artist and critic of the regime, Ai Weiwei. Resolute action is needed. I therefore call on the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to make a démarche with Beijing. Ai Weiwei must be released now.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Ai Weiwei was – and this is the very sad truth – one of the last remaining courageous critics of the Chinese leadership. His arrest was, without doubt, not just the culmination of a whole wave of arrests of critics, but also a message to all the others that not even international prominence can provide protection from being put back in prison by the Chinese authorities or from even disappearing completely. At the same time, our representations are regularly ignored in the human rights dialogue that the European Union is conducting with the Chinese representatives at all levels – with a friendly smile, but ignored and dismissed nonetheless.</p>
      <p sl="de">For us, the question arises as to what strategy we can use in response to this. I believe we must respond in our own China delegation and make it very clear on our next visit to China that we want to visit these critics too, that we want to see them – for otherwise there is no longer any point in continuing our human rights dialogue. We have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I condemn the arrest of Ai Weiwei and call for his immediate release. His detention is part of the most severe police crackdown in China in decades. Since 2008, China’s internal security budget has, incredibly, grown larger than its military budget. It now stands at an incredible USD 95 billion. This pays for a massive apparatus of State repression, including over 40 000 policemen whose sole job is to police the Internet for dissent.</p>
      <p sl="en">This repression is being stepped up because the regime fears the spread of revolution from the Middle East and North Africa. The regime is right to be afraid. The revolutions there demonstrate that a risen working class and the risen poor are more powerful than even the most brutal repressive methods, the most repressive regimes.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mass struggle is needed, in particular, the creation of independent, democratic mass organisations of the working class. The struggle against dictatorship must be linked to the struggle for genuine socialist change in China, whereby the vast wealth and resources in China are taken into democratic public ownership and the economy is democratically planned to raise the living standards of ordinary people.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as an artist, Ai Weiwei has given faces to the child victims of the Sichuan earthquake. As a civil rights activist, he has given a face to Charter 08. He is now giving a face to those people who have disappeared into the gaols and prisons of China – thousands of them anonymous. A hundred of them are known to us and here in this House, we must give a voice to these people who stand up for human rights but who have been temporarily silenced.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore say quite clearly that of course, these human rights debates and the dialogue are necessary. I understand those who say they have no desire to keep talking to a brick wall. If we stop talking to this brick wall, however, then the dictators will have got what they wanted.</p>
      <p sl="de">There was a great reformer, Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai was no democrat, but he was a Chinese patriot and he opened up his country. What we need is a democratic Zhou Enlai to arrange for a democratic opening up of his country. If the country fails to implement democratic reforms, it will end up in the same sort of crises as it suffered in the 1930s.</p>

The representatives of the European Union’s External Action Service and the Delegation of the EU to China must highlight the case of Ai Weiwei with the Chinese authorities at the highest diplomatic level.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The human rights dialogue with China, however, must not simply be allowed to remain at the level of diplomatic speeches. Given the repeated breaches of human rights and a human rights situation that has failed, the European Union must draw its conclusions and reconsider its relations with China. The human rights dialogue must not simply be empty words: positive steps need to be taken, and there must be follow-up and two-way discussion.</p>

      <p sl="en">A Uachtaráin, China is an enigma. On the one hand, it has modernised and taken on many Western practices, as we saw at the Olympics, which I had the privilege of attending, and indeed they were a great success. But while it has westernised in some ways, it is archaic in others, in particular, in relation to fundamental rights, especially freedom of opinion. The case of Ai Weiwei is a perfect example. Here is a world-renowned artist, arrested on 3 April for no apparent reason. Nobody has heard much about him since and this, of course, is totally and utterly unacceptable. We call here today for his return to his wife, his friends and assistants. Because one thing is for sure – and the Chinese should take note of this – Ai Weiwei will be remembered and renowned long after those who were responsible for his arrest are forgotten.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I think that what the Chinese are doing here is a deliberate political provocation, or to put it another way, a political test. It is intended to test the strength, the resolve and the credibility of democratic countries. It is an attack on human rights. It is true that there must be dialogue, but precisely for that reason we must make it clear to the People’s Republic of China that further economic cooperation must go hand in hand with further democratisation of their country. We therefore demand the release of Ai Weiwei.</p>
      <p sl="de">By the way, whenever dictators want to avoid being accused of political trials, they always play the tax evasion or economic crimes card. It was the case in the former GDR, it is the case in Russia, and unfortunately, it is also the case in the People’s Republic of China. That is why I emphatically endorse this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would first like to agree with Mr Verhofstadt. It is indeed shameful that these human rights debates, which are actually very important to us Europeans who believe in values, always take place on Thursday afternoons when most people have already left. I would like that noted in the record once more. It is something that we must change.</p>
      <p sl="de">Right now, however, we are talking about China and there we are more or less powerless, as has already been said. Mrs Lichtenberger spoke of a brick wall. Mr Posselt, I do not believe by the way that it is really in the Chinese interest – as you said – to help bring about a breakthrough in human rights. It is apparently not in the interest of the Chinese Government, although it is undoubtedly in the interest of the Chinese people.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are talking today about many people: Ai Weiwei and Liu Xiaobo have already been mentioned. We have frequently debated in the past how we can bring about a human rights breakthrough. It is not just a matter of instructing Baroness Ashton to speak out against the human rights abuses in China at every opportunity. All our foreign ministers and representatives must do so, and we need to stick together. I think that is the only way that we can actually have a small influence on China. Otherwise, as a strong economic power, China will play us off against each other and we will achieve nothing whatsoever. That would be a very bad thing, especially for the people concerned.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the detention of the distinguished Chinese artist, Ai Weiwei, at Beijing Airport on 3 April as he was attempting to travel to Hong Kong, has rightly drawn international concern. The delegation of the European Union to China and a public statement immediately condemned the increasing use of arbitrary detention against human rights defenders, lawyers and activists in China, and underline the EU’s concerns regarding Ai Weiwei.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the moment, we have no information concerning Mr Ai’s whereabouts, and I wish to emphasise today that the EU’s view on arbitrary detention and disappearance is that it constitutes a grave violation of human rights and is unacceptable in all circumstances. We call for the immediate release of Ai Weiwei.</p>
      <p sl="en">Moreover, as the resolution before this House makes clear, the detention of Ai Weiwei is only one among many recent incidents of arbitrary detention and disappearance in China. Several prominent Chinese lawyers who frequently act for defendants in human rights cases are reported to have been arrested by police officials since February and have not been seen since.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerns about their treatment are only intensified by the ongoing disappearance of the lawyer Gao Zhisheng who, with the exception of a brief reappearance in April 2010, has now been missing for over two years. The High Representative is worried about reports based on interviews with Mr Gao in April 2010 that during his initial period of disappearance, he was detained incommunicado in a variety of unauthorised places of detention and subjected to improper treatment.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are, moreover, reports that in recent weeks, a significant number of bloggers and political activists have either been charged with criminal offences, such as subverting state power, or have been detained without charge.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can assure this House that the Vice-President/High Representative, Catherine Ashton, is following developments very closely and will raise these issues with the Chinese authorities at the earliest opportunity, and that the EU will also make known its concern to the Chinese authorities at the next round of the EU-China human rights dialogue, for which we have proposed dates in May. Allow me to support the statement by Mrs Meissner that what is really needed is one voice, a unified message, which comes not only from the EU institutions, but from all EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, I believe we have all been following with approval and admiration the efforts of the Tibetan people to win the right to run their own country. The many attempts of the government in exile or the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of the Tibetans, to find a sensible solution through negotiation with the Chinese ruling power, have always ended in failure. The Chinese clearly do not regard the Tibetans as partners in a shared state, but as an obstacle preventing them from taking full possession of an occupied territory.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The position of the Nepalese Government is therefore complicated. On the one hand, it must comply with its international obligations and guarantee universal rights to the Tibetan community, but on the other, it cannot disregard the opinion of its enormous neighbour. The position of the Nepalese Government vis-à-vis the elections to the Tibetan Government in exile clearly tells us who is the real global player in this region. For the Nepalese Government, it is China.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We Europeans can make symbolic gestures and declare our reservations regarding the weak Nepalese Government. However, if we really want to bring about a change the position of the Tibetan people, our partner in the dialogue must be the Chinese Government, as it is the political leader in the region, influencing the rules of regional politics. We can, of course, make a declaration to the Nepalese Government, but that will not solve the problem.</p>

    <intervention id="4-366-000" speaker_id="4521" name="Charles Tannock" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, since the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy and the election of a Maoist-led government in Kathmandu, Nepal and China have inevitably grown much closer. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Nepalese authorities prevented Tibetan refugees living in Nepal from voting for a prime minister and a parliament in exile.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, a similar election plan for last October was disrupted by Nepalese police, undoubtedly in response to pressure from Beijing. The fact that China has sought to interfere with an unofficial election taking place in another sovereign neighbouring state is an indication of its leaders’ contempt for democracy and their paranoia about Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is obviously irrelevant to China that time and time again, the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, has stressed that he seeks maximum autonomy for Tibet, not independence. I hope that the High Representative – who is not here today – will raise this episode with China and also with Nepal, whose own nascent democracy is kept afloat partly by EU taxpayers’ money in the form of financial aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also wish to take this opportunity to salute the courage, fortitude and peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people whose example is an inspiration to us all. Nepal is indeed in a delicate position, geopolitically and geographically speaking, but it should seek inspiration from its democratic neighbour to the south, India, rather than from the repressive dictatorship which exists to its north, namely the PRC. Democracy will, I hope, one day be the norm throughout the whole of Asia.</p>

Since then, things have, in fact, only got worse. There has not been a single step forward. Now pressure is also being exerted abroad to make it as difficult as possible, or downright impossible, for Tibetans to exercise even their right to vote for a parliament in exile. We have seen for some years already how enormous pressure is being exerted on Nepal – whether this concerns accepting refugees or matters such as voting rights for Tibetans. However, we should be pleased that such things are guaranteed. The European Union should learn from this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Chinese leadership is exerting pressure on its sister party, even on Nepal as a whole, in order that action is taken against the Tibetans – and Nepal caves in. We must concentrate our efforts to counter this, and that includes the withdrawal of any aid.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there are three points that I would like to make concerning the ALDE amendments to this resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">First of all, the justification for the amendments is based on the causal nature of the occupation of Tibet by the People’s Republic of China in the thwarting of the Tibetan elections in Nepal. Although the resolution addressed the issue of the ban on elections for the Tibetan Government in exile in Nepal, it cannot be ripped out of the wider context of the status of Tibet.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, if there were no reference to the Chinese occupation of Tibet, which is the very cause and reason for Beijing putting pressure on the Nepalese Government, it would be like talking about the First World War without mentioning the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the call for meaningful autonomy for Tibet is the only constructive proposal that the European Parliament can make to avoid a reoccurrence of the ban on the Tibetan elections in Nepal. I call on colleagues to support it.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the country I come from has a great deal of rich experience when it comes to governments in exile. Between 1939 and 1990, a total of 15 Polish prime ministers and six presidents ruled from political exile. Poles did not give up the pursuit of democracy, and finally the red colour of solidarity was able to combine with the white of the ballot paper to give birth to a new, democratic state in 1989.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today, the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, too, has a chance for a new beginning thanks to the constitution, which will come into force on 28 May. It would be a pity if Nepal spoiled this celebration by continuing to limit the rights of the Tibetan minority and got a red card from the international community as a result. I consider preventing the participation of Tibetans from Nepal in the recent elections of the Prime Minister in exile an unacceptable violation of fundamental civil rights. The European Union should use all diplomatic and financial means in order to neutralise the pressure on Nepal by China and, in the long term, to ensure that the Tibetans have the right to vote, associate and demonstrate their views.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Just as in the case of Poland, where it was not possible to prevent the work of the 21 representatives of government who were in exile, so will the Dalai Lama’s successors, I am convinced, not stop their activities. Nepal and China should bear this in mind.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, on 20 March, around 80 000 exiled Tibetans worldwide participated in the direct election of a new prime minister and the members of the government. Members of the European Parliament, including members of the European Parliament Tibet Intergroup, attended as election observers. My experience in Switzerland was the same as that of my fellow Members in other countries: the elections were conducted fairly, in secret and absolutely in accordance with democratic rules. The only exception was in Nepal, where security forces – under pressure from the Chinese Government – prevented tens of thousands of Tibetans from taking part in the elections. In so doing, they continued the deliberate measures taken last year, when ballot boxes were confiscated and voting sites shut down. Yet Nepal is not a vassal state.</p>
      <p sl="de">The government in Kathmandu must prove that it can liberate itself from Chinese influence.

If one thing is certain, it is that Beijing has found a new ally in its harassment of the Tibetan people, and that new ally is Nepal. In reality, though, all this goes far beyond the elections because, for several years now, the Nepalese Government, under pressure from the Chinese authorities, has been placing ever more restrictions on the freedom of expression of Tibetans living in exile on its soil.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Last June, Kathmandu handed over Tibetan refugees to the Chinese authorities. Preventive arrests and the ban on demonstrations, assembly and even movement, have become a common occurrence for Tibetans living in Nepal.</p>

Moreover, we call on Nepal to stop this harassment and ill-treatment of political refugees, and simply to respect their rights.

One of the arguments that was always used by those who were critical of Tibetan resistance was that this resistance, focused on the figure of the Dalai Lama, had many non-democratic aspects. Now that the Tibetan resistance is in the process of democratisation, it is extremely unfortunate that Nepal, a country where so many Tibetans live, has prevented the democratic elections from being conducted in a normal way. However, I would also ask you to appreciate one thing: often, our governments are the first to yield to pressure by the Chinese Government to create a reality that agrees with the dreams and wishes of the Chinese leaders. We have to understand that in Nepal, the government probably wanted to do the same thing. Therefore, if we want to put pressure on the Nepalese Government to act differently, we also have to start by putting pressure on our own governments to show that they have some backbone in their discussions with the Chinese authorities.</p>

The more obstacles there are preventing people from exercising these rights, the greater their determination to exercise them.

Over 10 000 Tibetans in Nepal were not permitted to vote for a prime minister and members for the parliament of the government in exile.

      <p sl="en">The recent elections on 20 March were an important event for the community outside Tibet and represent a significant step forward in a long reform process envisaged by the Dalai Lama.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this background, we note with concern that the Nepalese authorities are tightening their grip on the political activities of Tibetans in Nepal. On 20 March, more than 10 000 of them were effectively stopped from voting by the authorities. This is not the first time this has happened. During an earlier round of voting in Nepal on 3 October last year, the polls were subject to a crack-down by the Nepalese authorities, which seized ballot boxes and closed the Tibetan community’s voting sites.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union, through its delegation in Kathmandu and the embassies of the EU Member States, has been monitoring these developments in close contact with the Tibetan community and the government.

      <p sl="fi">His spiritual role will remain in place, but his political duties will now be transferred to the Prime Minister of Tibet’s government in exile. That, however, will not be without its problems. Owing to growing pressure from the Chinese Government, the 20 000 or so Tibetans living in Nepal have not been allowed to vote. The Nepalese Government has said that the demonstrations by Tibetans go against the ‘One China’ policy and has confirmed that it will not allow ‘anti-Beijing activities’ on its soil. It has therefore imposed a voting ban on Tibetan groups.</p>
      <p sl="fi">This comes as no surprise, since the Nepalese authorities have been repeatedly guilty of breaching the freedom of expression and human rights of Tibetans in exile.

Now that the Dalai Lama has resigned from political leadership in favour of a new generation of democratic leaders, the Tibetans have been faced with an opportunity to strengthen democratic traditions, despite the fact that the Tibetan Government is still forced to operate in exile. However, thousands of Tibetans living in Nepal have been deprived of this right. The pressure from China seems to be very effective, and what have so far been peaceful demonstrations in defence of freedom of expression and fundamental rights may become a situation which is difficult to control, and this will certainly have international repercussions. After all, we can imagine how effectively the Chinese Government will want to deal with those who ‘disturb the peace’ in Tibet. Recent events should remind the world that the rights of the Tibetan people are constantly being violated and that the issue of Tibet is not a closed chapter, because the Tibetans will certainly continue to insist on respect for their independence, and they will do so with ever-increasing clamour.</p>

In July 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution implementing sanctions against Robert Mugabe and his entourage. The reason for this decision was, just like today, serious violations of human rights by the ruling administration.</p>
      <p sl="sk">New cases of intimidation, arrests and also the uninvestigated disappearance of political rivals of the ruling party confirm to us that Robert Mugabe and his political party know that a fair and transparent political contest would strip them of power and raise the prospect of penalties for terrorising the population and pillaging the wealth of the country over many years.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We can surely all agree on the adoption of the draft resolution, in the hope that measures initiated by the EU may assist the people of Zimbabwe, who are terrorised by their government, to reverse, with the assistance of civic and opposition leaders, the current difficult situation in the country by means that are as peaceful as possible.

      <p sl="en">We have been clear on two points. Firstly, that as long as Robert Mugabe remained in power, protected by a small self-serving element in Zanu-PF and the security forces, pillaging the nation’s wealth for their own enrichment, there was little prospect of real change. Secondly, that it was up to the people of Zimbabwe, with the support of their African neighbours – and here I name South Africa in particular of course – to bring about the necessary change.</p>
      <p sl="en">Maybe, just maybe, there is at last some movement in the right direction. You know when Mugabe is worried: he starts to panic. His police and militia start attacking anyone they see as opponents. The MDC is supposed to be in a power-sharing coalition, but in the past few days, MDC Ministers and MPs, as well as human rights activists, have been beaten up and arrested.</p>
      <p sl="en">I suppose Mugabe is increasingly nervous on two counts. He has seen what has happened to his friend and main bankroller, Gaddafi; and just a week ago, on 31 March, the Southern African Development Community, which includes South Africa and all Zimbabwe’s neighbours, at last voiced its grave concern at the resurgence of violence in Zimbabwe. It has called for an end to that violence and for all elements of the global political agreement to be implemented. It has appointed a team to work out a road map to peaceful, free and fair elections in Zimbabwe, and today, that team is in Harare.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are calling on European governments and the EU to intensify their engagement to use all their political influence in Southern Africa to help bring about rapid change for the better in Zimbabwe and pave the way for properly monitored elections to be held in an atmosphere free from intimidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until there is evidence of real change, the restrictive measures specifically targeting Mugabe and his close allies must remain in place. In this regard, there is no way that the EU should accredit Mugabe’s unilaterally appointed envoy as ambassador. Once the people of Zimbabwe have their freedom restored, and genuine democracy and the rule of law established, I feel sure that the international community, including the EU, stands ready to come forward with generous assistance.</p>

I used to work for a development organisation in Amsterdam and, every now and then, we would bring Zimbabwean human rights activists to the Netherlands, to Europe, in order to give them some breathing space. Not just so they could get to know other activists and swap stories, but also to give them an opportunity to get away from Zimbabwe for a little while.</p>
      <p sl="nl">One of the people I met at that time was Abel Chikomo, whom we have also mentioned in this resolution.

It is because of people like him that we are adopting these kinds of resolutions because, to be honest, I do not think that Mr Mugabe is losing any sleep over this. What these resolutions are about is ensuring that he and his colleagues from the MDC have renewed motivation to continue their work. What could we possibly aim to do with these resolutions other than enforcing sanctions?</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would therefore insist that we tighten the Kimberley Process for the trade in conflict diamonds to such an extent that diamonds from Zimbabwe are prevented from being offered for sale at all, because they are the reason why the government has been violating human rights, oppressing people, using child labour and so forth.

      <p sl="pt">Police raids on offices of human rights organisations, such as the Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum and several others, allegedly in searches for subversive material, and the arrests of various NGO workers and members of the MDC itself, along with students and young activists, which have intensified since February, are tactics in an unacceptable campaign of intimidation. Instead of launching a campaign of terror against those who refuse to sign a petition against the restrictive measures imposed by the EU on leaders linked to Mugabe, the leaders of Zanu-PF should pay more attention to the lessons to be drawn from the Arab Spring, and allow truly free elections to take place.</p>

Of the three topics we are discussing, this is by far the worst and probably the most recurring, as speakers have said. Robert Mugabe has been strutting the world stage for far too long now and has been behaving in a most dictatorial and brutal fashion towards his own people, and particularly towards opponents within his country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The government of national unity, which was set up in 2009 to bring about democracy, is obviously not working, due to his efforts to ensure that it does not. The intimidation, arbitrary arrests and disappearances – which is probably another way of saying summary executions – of opponents, particularly in recent months, is quite unacceptable. Even NGOs have not escaped: their offices have been raided and their staff have been detained, so it is quite obvious that action needs to be taken against this dictator.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Mr Van Orden said, at least the African Union is now beginning to form some class of opposition to him, and that gives us here in the European Union an opportunity to side with it and to bring every possible diplomatic force that we have at our disposal to bear on this issue to ensure, firstly, that Mr Mugabe stops the arrests and the executions, and secondly, that the constitution is accepted for the freedom of the Zimbabwean people, which will lead to free elections and the establishment of a truly democratic government in Zimbabwe.</p>

The fact is that Mr Mugabe and his allies have done everything they can to ensure that this agreement does not work.

      <p sl="pt">It is vital that the EU does not avert its gaze from what is happening in Zimbabwe, that it does not allow Mr Mugabe to get away with this final trick of appointing an ambassador without going through his country’s constitutional mechanisms, and that it also ensures that the sale of diamonds does not profit Mr Mugabe and his allies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, not everyone in Zimbabwe will be happy about today’s debate, since in a few days’ time, 18 April will be Independence Day in Zimbabwe. Those who do wrong things in this country will have their celebration spoiled.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Agreements concerning the distribution of power are often problematic. This is due to the fact that generally, they do not reflect the result of a democratic decision of the citizens, but a compromise forced by the situation. This was precisely the case in Zimbabwe. However, agreements on the power sharing can be acceptable and may have a positive impact on society if certain conditions are met. One of them is the improvement of the human rights situation. That is why we are dealing with human rights in this country. For example, it is questionable whether the restrictive measures represent a necessary and effective tool. However, we must not allow people who do not want to sign a petition calling for the abolition of these measures to be beaten and harassed. That is why we defend those who struggle for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="el">We are responsible for what is happening in Africa. We have intervened on numerous occasions in the history of democracy on this continent, especially at the beginning when these new countries were being created, and we have obstructed democratic procedures when they threatened our interests. As such, we have a double duty to help Zimbabwe acquire a democratically elected government.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EU supports the Kimberley Process, which aims to eliminate African conflict diamonds – or so-called blood diamonds – from the global market. However, recent developments in Zimbabwe are worrying. The Chairman of the Kimberley Process, Mr Mathieu Yamba from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has decided unilaterally, and without consultation, to allow the marketing of diamonds from Zimbabwe’s Marange mine. This mine, which was debated in the House last year, was seized by President Robert Mugabe and his cronies. Hundreds of people were dispossessed of their homes and there are reliable reports of his security forces torturing, raping, and even killing, local residents.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sale of diamonds from the Marange mine will help Mugabe to further consolidate his tyrannical hold on Zimbabwe and, indeed, enrich his Zanu-PF thugs. I therefore urge the European Union, as a party to the Kimberley Process, to raise this scandal at the highest level and insist on the restoration of consensus-based decision making in the Kimberley Process. More generally, I have long been calling for a similar system, a certification, to cover other natural resources extracted in Africa in order to prevent brutal governments or guerrilla groups from selling minerals to fund arms purchases. I am pleased to be working alongside the London-based, internationally renowned, human rights NGO Global Witness in this endeavour, in which the US Administration is leading the way with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, let me begin by saying that whenever I hear talk of Robert Mugabe, I see the Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu, before me. In actual fact, in the 1980s, Mugabe was a regular guest of Ceauşescu’s, along with Gaddafi. I am grateful to Mr Van Orden because he reminded me of the link between Mugabe and Gaddafi.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In fact, I think that Mugabe has learnt something from Ceauşescu, namely, hatred for civil society activists. The 46 members of civil society who were arrested on 19 February by the security forces in Zimbabwe are currently charged with treason. They are now at risk of being sentenced to death. This is the penalty. Their only ‘crime’ is that they discussed what happened in Egypt and Tunisia.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, in February, the EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted conclusions concerning the situation in Zimbabwe. The period for EU sanctions to be in effect would be continued, because no adequate progress had really been made in the country’s internal reforms.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The lifting of restrictions will require tangible progress to be made in the implementation of the political power sharing agreement of 2008. That apparent power sharing agreement was unable to prevent Mugabe’s security forces from continuing to persecute his opponents, and right now, they are being arrested, tortured and murdered, even right up to ministerial level.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Since EU sanctions are not targeted at the people of Zimbabwe, the EU at present is still the country’s biggest provider of aid, which it grants, in particular, for agriculture and food production. The EU must continue to put pressure on Mugabe, and if there is a decision to hold elections, the EU should be involved as an observer.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, since our last debate on Zimbabwe in October last year, the situation in this country in southern Africa has not changed. Unemployment has reached 90%, average life expectancy is 44 years, and the citizens of this country have no access to basic healthcare services. It is obvious that the political agreement reached two years ago by President Mugabe and Prime Minister Tsvangirai has failed to meet the hopes placed in it and that a new, fully democratic solution is needed. The internal situation in Zimbabwe has not changed in the last six months, but the external situation has. Today, we are debating a country in the context of the ‘Spring of Nations’ in Africa, and although Harare is 6 000 kilometres away from Tunis, the most recent case of Côte d’Ivoire shows that sometimes, democracy knows no barriers at all. The European Parliament therefore urges the government of Zimbabwe to take into account the current international situation and the strong reorientation in domestic politics and, above all, to cease repression of the political opposition, to release its representatives from the prisons and allow them to participate in the elections.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Six months ago, I said that a poor country like Zimbabwe cannot afford to look for alternative problems. Today, I think that the African ‘Spring of Nations’ puts an additional strain on the political debt of President Mugabe.</p>

Zimbabwe must abide by its international commitments, including the African Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights, by repealing all its national laws which contravene the international texts on the protection of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the events currently going on in Zimbabwe sound an alarm bell for the human rights situation on the African continent. With the prospect of the elections in June, President Mugabe is conducting a campaign of intimidation against his rival candidates. Hundreds of government officials, human rights activists and opponents of the regime have been arrested during the last two months. This situation is unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, the drafting of a democratic constitution has been postponed for a year by Mugabe. The new fundamental law would have guaranteed that the elections were held in transparent circumstances.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I should point out that the country’s economic situation is deeply affected. The President supports nationalisation of the mining sector, which is the main economic sector in Zimbabwe. Such a measure is harmful as it is precisely the foreign investments in this sector which have maintained the state’s stability in the wake of the economic crisis.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, in Zimbabwe, President Mugabe and the Zanu-PF Party have not managed to keep to the terms of the Global Political Agreement concluded in 2009. Zimbabwe has been unable to move towards democracy. On the contrary, in the past few months, there has been a clear increase in the intimidation of political opponents and the number of arbitrary arrests and disappearances. Efforts to create stability will not bear fruit in a political climate like the present one.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Zimbabwe is still a country where you can be abused or tortured for your political opinions. The legislative system, which suppresses free and open journalism, restricts the right to freedom of speech. Journalists are harassed. Everything should be done to support the country’s progress towards genuine democracy and economic development.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is only right and fitting that, in February this year, the European Council decided to extend restrictive measures concerning people and organisations connected with the Mugabe administration and to keep a record of the blacklist. I also think that these should be continued until there is real evidence of genuine change in Zimbabwe. However, the measures should only be targeted at Zimbabwe’s corrupt government and must not be allowed to exacerbate the plight of the Zimbabwean people.</p>

They never wrote of the people of Rhodesia having to go hungry. What we hear from this country today is simply intolerable. Rhodesia, and later Zimbabwe, were the bread basket of southern Africa. Mr Mugabe – a communist socialist dictator – has managed to turn this bread basket into a famine zone.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think we would all agree that Zimbabwe and its human rights violations have been on our agenda for far too long. Every glimpse of hope of some positive development is immediately crushed by outbursts of political repression and violence. This is exactly what happened again just a couple of months ago. The European Union therefore had to proceed to renew its restrictive measures, for the eighth time, in February this year.</p>
      <p sl="en">By this clear gesture, we wanted to underline the critical importance of an agreement between the government parties on the necessary steps leading to elections in the country. In this context, the EU emphasised its willingness to revise its decision in response to further concrete developments on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU is deeply concerned at the upsurge in political violence seen in recent months in Zimbabwe. On 11 March, together with 21 embassies and representations, the EU issued a statement to express its concerns over the increase in what appears to be politically motivated intimidation and violence.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the EU welcomes the outcome of the recent SADC summit on 31 March 2011. The SADC communiqué calls for an immediate end to violence, intimidation, hate speech and harassment, and calls upon the government of Zimbabwe to complete all necessary steps to hold an election. It offers assistance so that elections can be organised in accordance with SADC principles and guidelines governing democratic elections. For that reason, the SADC will appoint officials to join the South African facilitation team and work with the joint monitoring and implementation committee.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU believes that strengthened facilitation and mediation efforts by SADC and South Africa are key to preventing further instability in Zimbabwe. The EU welcomes the region’s efforts to mediate in the Zimbabwean crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">South Africa, in its capacity as facilitator, together with the SADC, as guarantor of the Global Political Agreement, has decided to accredit the Zimbabwean Ambassador. At this point in time, keeping a formal channel of communication open with Zimbabwe and maintaining a dialogue with the inclusive government is vital, and we should not jeopardise the position of the EU Ambassador in Harare. The EU will act and proceed in close coordination with all EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU remains the largest provider of development assistance to Zimbabwe. We want to clearly express that we are tough on the regime, but we try to assist the people. With the disbursement of approximately 365 million since the establishment of the Global Political Agreement in 2009, we are – as I said – the largest donor.</p>
      <p sl="en">Resources are only channelled through UN bodies and specialised NGOs. Since 2009, the EU has also supported governance reforms, as stipulated in the Global Political Agreement, including the constitutional reform process. The EU also funds human rights programmes, including programmes from human rights defenders. We just have to hope that all the international pressure will finally lead to free and fair elections in Zimbabwe and to the gradual normalisation of the very difficult situation in this country.</p>

      <p sl="fr">In recent months, many opponents of the Mugabe regime as well as NGO representatives have been arbitrarily arrested by the Zimbabwean authorities. Mr Mugabe’s party has systematically prevented Zimbabwe’s government of national unity, formed in 2009, from paving the way for a democratic transition and credible elections. There must be an immediate end to all political violence perpetrated by Mr Mugabe’s supporters. The European Union and its Member States must actively engage with the African Union and the Southern African Development Community so as to ensure that future elections are not held in a climate of intimidation and violence.

      <p sl="ro">Once again, we see that intimidation, arrest, violence and even torture are the weapons used by Mugabe against his political opponents and civil society. The forces loyal to Mugabe have intimidated opposition ministers in the government of national unity. They have harassed leaders of human rights organisations and arrested 46 representatives of civil society on the charge of treason, with some of them having been beaten and even tortured while under arrest. A sustainable structure cannot be built based on fear and terror or against civil and political liberties.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I call on the European Union’s High Representative to support the efforts to hold free elections in Zimbabwe, devoid of violence and intimidation. A legitimate government is required which will respect rights and fundamental freedoms, in other words, show respect for human beings. Tightening the European Union’s restrictions on Mugabe’s people must be one measure.</p>
