      <p sl="unknown">To begin with, there are a number of statements. Five days ago, the sad news reached us of the death of the French journalist, Gilles Jacquier, who was killed at Homs in Syria. Last year alone, over 100 journalists met their death in the course of their work. The European Parliament has always upheld freedom of speech. We have defended, and will always defend, those who uncover the truth and bring it to the attention of public opinion.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In the shipwreck of the Italian cruise liner, at least six people have died and about a dozen are missing. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to extend our condolences to the families of the victims. This accident should not have happened. We trust that everywhere, the appropriate lessons will be learned from this disaster.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">News has reached us of the death of Manuel Fraga Iribarne. Yesterday, Spain and Europe lost a great statesman: one of the main architects of democracy in Spain and the founder of the People’s Party, some of whose members are with us in the Chamber. The late Mr Fraga Iribarne was himself also a Member of the European Parliament in the 1980s. I would like to offer our condolences to our fellow Member, Mr Fraga Iribarne’s daughter, Carmen Fraga Estévez, and ask her to convey them to the whole family.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The eighteenth of December last year saw the passing of Václav Havel, who was President first of Czechoslovakia and then twice of the Czech Republic. Europe, and not just the Czechs and the Slovaks, has lost a symbol of the Velvet Revolution, someone who, in particular, is a symbol of the renewed union of our continent. He was a courageous statesman. As we all remember, two years ago, in November 2009, Mr Havel was a guest in the European Parliament. We received him then with a standing ovation. Today, we all pay tribute to his memory. I was present, on behalf of us all, ladies and gentlemen, at the funeral of President Havel in Prague. It was a very important ceremony: a European ceremony, and one which was important even beyond the borders of Europe. About a dozen Heads of State or Government were present. In profound reflection, we bid farewell to a great European and a great Czech.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to ask you now to observe a minute’s silence in honour of both departed statesmen.</p>
