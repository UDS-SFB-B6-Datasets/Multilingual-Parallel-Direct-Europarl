      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, the meeting of the European Council on 1 and 2 March was positive and not overshadowed by an immediate crisis. But, there can be no complacency in facing the enormous economic challenges that still remain before us. Sustained effort on several fronts remains necessary. One front is fiscal consolidation. Another is the growth and employment agenda. Some claim that these two are contradictory. It is our job to make sure that they are not.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the 1930s, the main response to an economic downturn has been a fiscal stimulus: deliberate deficit spending by governments to boost demand. Indeed, in 2008, a coordinated fiscal stimulus was agreed, which undoubtedly helped in the short term. However, the ability to use this instrument is limited in most Member States, because of their already excessive debt levels. What had been a solution became a problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">The reasons behind the debt problem are diverse. In most cases, it is not because of gross profligacy in public spending. In some, it is because of large banking sectors, insufficiently supervised, which collapsed and had to be rescued by the taxpayer. In some others, economic growth, fuelled by asset bubbles, artificially boosted budget revenues which quickly collapsed, with the crisis increasing budget deficits and debt.</p>
      <p sl="en">But for several, it is because debt levels have accumulated gradually over time, leaving most Member States with debts well over the agreed maximum of 60% of GDP. They applied Keynesianism asymmetrically: deficits during a slowdown were rarely eliminated during peaks – let alone replaced by surpluses. They were left with no safety margin when the crisis hit.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the rules agreed in the new Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which was signed on the occasion of this European Council, are so important. They do not prevent countercyclical deficits as long as the structural deficit over the economic cycle is balanced, or at least remains very small, nor do they limit public expenditure: they simply provide that this must not be financed by excessive borrowing.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council stated that all Member States should continue to respect their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact, which has been strongly reinforced by the ‘six-pack’. But at the same time, the focus on consolidation, especially in the short term, must go hand in hand with further efforts to secure economic growth and improve employment prospects.</p>
      <p sl="en">How to do this was the focus of both the European Council, in the context of the European Semester, and, as I reported to you already, the one in January. We approached the question from many angles. Making sure that, at the same time as we bring budgets under control, we keep investing in our future, in education, in research and development, in innovation. Stimulating investment. Looking closely at expenditure. Making assistance to the unemployed more pro-active. Looking at revenues, for instance, by tackling tax evasion and tax fraud. Exploiting to the full the single market, especially the services and digital markets, as emphasised again in a letter by 12 colleagues. Reducing the tax burden on labour, especially on low-income earners. Increasing trade. Opening sheltered sectors, such as professional services and retail. Improving the business environment, cutting red tape and paperwork thanks to digital public administration. In short, making the right choices for jobs and growth in the midst of fiscal consolidation.</p>
      <p sl="en">All this will be monitored by the institutions. As you know, the Semester is our annual policy coordination tool, running from the release of the Commission’s annual growth survey to the June European Council, which will adopt country-specific recommendations, a key moment in the Semester.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, some of the supply-side measures take time to have an effect, whereas fiscal consolidation has a more immediate dampening effect on demand. But we may be able to avoid an overall contraction in credit and I hope the banks will take advantage of the ample liquidity support provided by the European Central Bank to pass on some of these resources to businesses and households. The action taken by governments and the ECB is also helping to stabilise sovereign debt markets in the countries under pressure. It is crucial for countries also not to relent in their efforts and to stick to their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact and the new Fiscal Stability Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="en">Alongside this monetary policy, the overall policy of restoring confidence in the euro area at different levels will contribute to restored confidence by consumers and investors and will, in that way, contribute to growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our strategy is starting to work. We have reached a turning point in the crisis while being fully aware of the remaining vulnerabilities. We need a short- and a longer-term strategy for growth. The latter is embodied in the Europe 2020 strategy, now also closely monitored in the Semester, but we also need a specific employment policy, especially for young people. Even if the main responsibility lies with the Member States, the Union can give guidance, as we have done in the European Council conclusions. We look forward to the Commission’s forthcoming ‘employment package’ to take this work further.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also talked about the situation in Greece and we welcomed the progress made on the new Greek programme. The aim is to put the Greek economy back on a sustainable footing, both in terms of debt sustainability and competitiveness. Euro area leaders support the efforts undertaken by Greece. And may I just underline, for those who claim that the European Union is ‘imposing’ austerity on Greece, that, in fact, euro area countries and the IMF are providing another EUR 130 billion, on top of the first package of EUR 110 billion, of long-term low-interest loans to Greece, and helped it to secure a write-down of 70% of the net present value of its debts to private banks. Overall support to Greece represents more than 100% of its GDP. Without all this, Greece’s situation, difficult as it is, would be far, far worse.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we also need a strong growth agenda for Greece mobilising European funds, foreign investments and maximising the growth potential of the Greek economy. The Commission was asked to step up its technical assistance to Greece to achieve this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Euro area leaders also confirmed their commitment to reassess the adequacy of the overall ceiling of the EFSF/ESM firewall by the end of the month, via the Euro Group. In addition, they agreed to accelerate the payments of the paid-in capital for the ESM.</p>
      <p sl="en">During this European Council, we had a wide range of other issues to discuss also. On Serbia: we agreed to grant it the status of EU candidate. This is a remarkable achievement – a result of the efforts demonstrated by both sides in the dialogue between Belgrade and Priština. I hope it will encourage Serbia to undertake further efforts in order to meet the political and economic criteria for EU membership and to continue to support regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans. We expect further normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Priština.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Area: we have asked the JHA Council to adopt its decision in September and, in the meantime, to identify and implement safeguarding measures aimed at contributing to the success of the process.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Syria: facing an appalling situation, we focused on three key aspects of this crisis. On the humanitarian side, we called for an immediate end to the violence against civilians and human rights abuses, making it clear that those responsible for atrocities will be held accountable. We also called for humanitarian agencies to have unhindered access – the EU has already mobilised humanitarian funding.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the political side, we confirmed the EU’s commitment to further increase the pressure on the Syrian regime, and invited the Council to prepare further targeted restrictive measures. We called on President Assad to step aside. As soon as a democratic transition begins, we are ready to develop a new partnership and provide assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the diplomatic front, we supported the efforts by the Arab League, the mission undertaken by Kofi Annan and the launching of the Group of the Friends of the Syrian People. We also called on all members of the UN Security Council, particularly Russia and China, to work together in an effort to stop the violence. Let us not forget that we cannot act decisively without a UN mandate.</p>
      <p sl="en">This view was unanimously supported. Evidence, I remind you, that there is more common foreign policy than some think. We have a common position on Iran, on Syria, on Libya, on the Southern Neighbourhood and so on. In other words, in the world’s most dangerous region, the 27 are working hand in hand. This is a fact often overlooked.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I was honoured that all 27 Heads of State or Government of the European Council decided to ask me to continue as their President for another two-and-a-half years. Furthermore, 17 of them, from the euro area countries, also asked me to chair the euro summit meetings.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking forward, it will not come as a surprise that my first priority will remain the economy. It is our lifeline. We need a strong economic base to preserve our social models, to achieve high levels of employment, including for the younger generation, and it is the only way to play a role on the world stage equal to our potential. It is a privilege to continue the work in this decisive moment for Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="2-012-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, President of the European Council, distinguished Members of Parliament. First, while I have already congratulated President Van Rompuy on his reappointment, I would like in this Chamber to reiterate my thanks and appreciation for the work that he has carried out over the last two-and-a-half years. I look forward to continuing to work with him to build a stronger European Union – stronger in defence of the interests of our citizens and also stronger in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">The President of the European Council has already outlined the main outcomes of this summit, including the important discussions we had on external relations issues – namely, the situation in Syria and relations with Iran and, of course, the very important decision to grant candidate status to Serbia.</p>
      <p sl="en">On my side, I would like to highlight a few elements that demonstrate that the European Union may be turning the corner towards renewed stability and growth. Let us be clear; there is now less tension regarding the euro area, but we are not yet out of the crisis. The situation remains fragile and we have to complete our work, including the reinforcement of the firewalls. These are an indispensable counterpart of our reinforced economic governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said before in this Parliament, I expect Heads of State or Government to focus not just on short-term crisis management, but also on growth: smart, sustainable, inclusive growth, which is the key to job creation and the future prosperity of Europe. This was, and remains, the first objective of the Europe 2020 strategy and is at the centre of the comprehensive approach behind the Road map to Stability and Growth which I presented in this Parliament last October. This approach is now gaining support and this European Council was a step in the right direction, although a lot remains to be done.</p>
      <p sl="en">At this summit, progress was achieved concerning key elements of this comprehensive approach: first, an agreement for a response to the problems in Greece; secondly, financial stability; and thirdly, job-creating growth through our Europe 2020 agenda, namely, through concrete initiatives frontloading targeted investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with Greece. Some people continue to say that Greece will not make it. I ask why? Why should Greece not be able to carry out the necessary reforms for its competitiveness? I believe it is possible. The Greek Government and the Greek Parliament believe it is possible. The decision on PSI shows that it can be possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">The priority now is to make the second programme work. This is our collective task, supporting the Greek authorities and the Greek people. To that end, the Commission is already taking concrete steps. Together with those Commissioners most closely involved, I have had very concrete talks with Prime Minister Papademos and his team about getting key growth-enhancing decisions taken immediately.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you will have seen from my letter, we have agreed to concentrate on a number of key priorities: improving youth employment, promoting a more business-friendly environment, providing liquidity to SMEs and sweeping away barriers to the absorption of structural funds. These are all areas where we can make real progress in weeks, not months or years.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission Task Force under Horst Reichenbach is currently on the ground discussing how to put these measures into practice with the Greek Government. Finally, just yesterday, I held a meeting with President Hoyer of the European Investment Bank to examine how our support for Greece can be made more effective.</p>
      <p sl="en">To cement this approach, I intend, in the coming weeks, to present, together with Vice-President Rehn, a communication on growth and jobs for Greece, taking stock of the progress that has been made and setting out the top priorities for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I set out in the Road map to Stability and Growth, finding a lasting solution to the problems in Greece is an essential prerequisite for stability. Without stability, there is no confidence, and without confidence, we will not get growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">The signature of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Growth was a further sign of the commitment to discipline and convergence. This, as you know, was not the Commission’s preferred mechanism due to its intergovernmental nature. However, its signature – not only by euro area countries, but by 25 out of the current 27 Member States – is a political statement that the euro is not just the currency of some countries but of the European Union. It is a strong political message about the irreversibility of the euro, and it was very well received by investors in Europe and outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is the very culture of financial stability that is a condition for a true economic union. Together with the ‘six-pack’ and the European Stability Mechanism, it is an important step in this process. It is therefore vital that all its appropriate provisions can be brought into line with European Union law as soon as possible. The contracting Member States have agreed to integrate the provisions of the Treaty into European Union law within five years. Already, the Commission has proposed further amendments to the ‘two-pack’ to make sure that important provisions of the fiscal compact are implemented under Community law: that means also with the active participation of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">Naturally, this agreement could not – and perhaps it should not – cover all the elements of an economic union and its most pressing objectives like the internal market or economic, social and territorial cohesion. These objectives are indeed better pursued, from a Community perspective, in the framework of the existing treaties, and through the European institutions and the Community method.</p>
      <p sl="en">Implementing the Europe 2020 agenda for growth and jobs dominated our agenda at the European Council. Financial stability is indispensable but it is not sufficient. As we said several times, we need financial stability and economic growth: the one and the other.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the road map made clear, there are a number of elements towards growth that must be implemented at the same time. These include, among others, structural reforms, deepening of the single market, targeted investment – yes, we need investment – and boosting trade with foreign markets.</p>
      <p sl="en">On these points, I made clear to the European Council that Member States must do more to close the implementation gap between political will and decisions taken on the ground. I made it clear that it was not sufficient to talk about Europe 2020 only in Brussels in the Justus Lipsius Building, but that we need to own this strategy at all levels, including the social partners, the regions, and our societies. I also made clear that we need a perspective of social inclusion because there are some situations of social emergency, and indeed rising poverty, in many of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I made a point that structural reform must be politically, but also socially acceptable to our citizens. Social dialogue is vital in this respect; that is why I place such importance on the tripartite social summit at European level, and social dialogue between employers and unions at national level. This is one element in demonstrating that the path we are taking is a fair one, where the burden and the benefits are both shared.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fairness was a key motivation behind the Commission’s proposal for a financial transaction tax last year. More broadly, the last three European Councils have highlighted taxation as a fundamental component in our recovery efforts. This should not be a surprise. Recent figures indicate that as much as EUR 1 trillion is lost every year in the European Union through tax evasion and avoidance. Compare this EUR 1 trillion to what is needed to consolidate national budgets, and you can imagine that many problems could be solved.</p>
      <p sl="en">A strong, unified stance is the only way forward to tackle the issue. The Commission is working on concrete measures to toughen our stance against tax evasion and fraud but Member States have an important duty to fulfil at European level too. There is no reason for any further delay on adopting the revised Savings Directive and the negotiating mandates for tax agreements with third countries. This is blocked, as you know, at Council level. This is another negative example of the implementation gap I mentioned earlier: positions that are taken at the European Council but are not afterwards followed up by the Council or by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have said that the programme for achieving growth is Europe 2020 and the instrument to achieve it is the multiannual financial framework. The European budget is a budget for investment; I hope that it will be in this perspective that we will have constructive discussions with the Member States about it, and I am pleased to see that the European Parliament has taken that position. I am also pleased that Commission proposals on project bonds for infrastructure development and the roll-out of broadband were accepted at this European Council. Together with other priority actions, such as accelerating some initiatives under the Annual Growth Survey and completing the single market, these measures will create jobs in the short term and make the European economy more competitive in the longer term.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our citizens want to see real action that will make a difference to their daily lives. Since the informal European Council at the end of January, the Commission has been taking this action with regard to slashing youth unemployment and providing support to SMEs. SMEs are the answer to the need to create more jobs in Europe. Commission teams have visited eight Member States since then. In almost every case, in close cooperation with the national administrations, they found ways of helping to get more young people into work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me close by reiterating that we have now come a long way in creating more stable conditions which will enable us to do the bulk of the work still before us. What we need is not constant drama about the euro, but hard work and determination in our action to sustain the European social market economy. No, the European social model is not dead. But in a more challenging environment, we need a more competitive Europe that delivers stability and growth through responsibility and solidarity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to congratulate you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your appointment, and I wish you a great deal of courage for the next two and a half years, since we all need good proposals to create jobs in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think there are two lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The first is putting national and regional finances back on track, and it can wait no longer. The signing of the fiscal treaty, with 25 members, two days ago, shows that this lesson has been learnt by the most far-sighted countries of the EU. The treaty imposes an obligation on its signatories to show good faith, honesty and discipline. However, everyone knows that actually applying a provision is more important than signing it. This is where we are waiting for the Member States, and for the Commission, as Guardian of the Treaties. Everyone remembers how the Stability Pact was infringed by the largest Member States. Everyone remembers that a certain President of the Commission even called it ‘stupid’. I therefore welcome the fiscal treaty which is, with the ‘six-pack’ and, soon, the ‘two-pack’ as well, a useful instrument. However, I would like to call for vigilance regarding how they are actually applied.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second lesson to learn from the crisis is the emphasis to be placed on a return to sustainable growth and growth that creates jobs. I must say that, in this area, there has been no real progress since the start of the crisis. The Council meeting in January merely contented itself with making recommendations to the Member States, without any coordination or overall plan. As for the Commission, it is working extremely hard, but the many initiatives it is undertaking would be better understood and more effective if they formed part of an overall project, particularly a project for growth and employment. Above all, I am struck by the difficulty and also the slowness with which too many Member States are applying the rules to which they have, nonetheless, made a commitment. On this point, I also expect the Commission to be more vigilant in its efforts to put Member States back on the right path. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is proposing two courses of action, which it will place on an official basis in a public letter to the Council and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The first area concerns the internal market. At the end of this year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the single market. However, 20 years on, there are still more than 150 bottlenecks hampering the operation of that market. It is for this reason that I am calling not only for us to ensure that the rules that have been adopted are actually applied, but also for a legislative package to be put forward, together with a precise timetable to enable us to complete the internal market. This is an urgent matter and within in it we can find, as I say every day, at least a small percentage of growth for all the countries, which is very important at this difficult time. The services sector, which is vital for Europe’s economy, constitutes in itself one of the largest blockages. Prices vary within the European Union; they can be up to twice as high for medicines, three times as high for medical treatments, four times as high for certain kinds of insurance and 100 times as high for the same university qualifications. When we know this, it is clear that action can wait no longer. Of course, we cannot do everything at once. It is for this reason that I call upon the Commission to start with a new legislative initiative in 10 sectors of the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second course of action recommended by the PPE Group concerns the investments needed for growth. I am also proposing, on this point, that in the European budgets for the next few years, a share allocated to investments generating growth and jobs should be protected. Let me be clear: it is not a question of new expenditure or additional budgets, but of channelling funds that are already available towards sustainable investment. Finally, we must provide ourselves with our own resources. It is not widely enough known that one euro invested by the EU can produce, through its multiplier effect, up to EUR 5 in investment. To take the example of energy, in 2010, the EUR 4 billion injected into the sector ended up generating EUR 22 billion in investment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will finish with this: our fellow citizens, particularly young people, need jobs now. Our economy needs small growth to begin with and guaranteed growth for the future. The budget pact will ensure healthy and honest finances. Mr Barroso, I believe that on this point, you are right. We must combat tax evasion more rigorously. You have quoted the figures, and it is an enormous problem. We must act to create jobs, while the completion of the single market and the protection of the investment budget ought to generate sustainable growth and jobs.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Van Rompuy on his re-election. There are a lot of discussions ahead of us and some controversial issues to be dealt with. We still have a great deal to do. Secondly, I would like to congratulate the Council on its decision regarding Serbia. I believe that it is the right option for Serbia, for the region and also for Kosovo. Unfortunately, no positive decisions were made about Schengen, in particular, with regard to Bulgaria and Romania. The people of these countries deserve to have the Schengen Area enlarged. I hope that this will happen soon.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, what shocked me was the statement by Mr Sarkozy after the Council meeting in which he said that Schengen should possibly be suspended. Will we have to bring our passports again when we come to Strasbourg? Are the many absent members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) already looking for their passports ready for their next trip to Strasbourg? This surely cannot be meant seriously.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">Now, Mr Sarkozy’s spokesperson is saying that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is preventing the reform of Schengen. This is not true. We are not preventing reform; we simply do not want to take a step backwards. We need to move forwards in Europe and not back. Therefore, I am calling on Mr Sarkozy, in the light of his possible election defeat, not to dig out all the old nationalist and anti-European relics. Let us remain realistic and continue focusing on the future. Let us commit to Europe. That would be a good thing for Mr Sarkozy to do.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">I would now like to turn to economic issues. I read the following sentences in an interview in a German magazine. ‘How do you intend to maintain your system of supply and demand if you do not care about the people who are supposed to be buying the products? We need a system which gives those on low incomes a share in the profits of global financial speculation. A system is only ever as strong as the poor people who form part of it’.</p>
      <p sl="de">This was said not by an economist or a politician, but by the human rights campaigner and singer, Harry Belafonte. Unfortunately, there are many politicians in Europe who do not have Mr Belafonte’s economic common sense. I think this is very sad and I believe that it is something which we need to change in Europe.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The system will not work without support for demand and support for the weaker members of society. However, in some cases, we are doing the opposite; for example, in Greece and also in Spain. We are achieving the opposite of what we want to achieve. We are creating less growth and employment rather than more. We are also reducing taxes and public revenues rather than increasing them. However, the fact that we have responded so late to the problem of youth unemployment is a particularly serious matter. Mr Van Rompuy, you are right that the Council has reacted, but we have seen huge increases in youth unemployment since 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">What are we to say to the young people who cannot find work? It is appalling that young people from Europe are being forced to emigrate to Argentina, Angola and Brazil in order to get a job. It is appalling that many young people have to work for what almost amounts to starvation wages. What are we to say to this generazione mille euro as they are called in Italy? In fact, they are the generazione con meno di mille euro because many of them earn less than EUR 1 000 per month. What are we to say to these young people? How can we win them over to the cause of Europe? Therefore, on behalf of my group, I am calling for a job and training guarantee. Mr Van Rompuy, you were right when you said to me that this is the responsibility of the Member States. However, the budgets are also the responsibility of the Member States and that does not stop Europe getting involved in them. My group and I would like to see Europe getting involved with young people and giving them the possibility of a job or of training.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That is part of the European social model. I would like to make one thing quite clear and my remarks are also aimed at Mr Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank, although what he said may simply have been misunderstood: the European social model is not dead. The European social model must not be allowed to die. We Social Democrats are in favour of its continued survival. We need to reform it, but the European social model is part of our identity and we will defend this identity to the hilt.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, many people believe that the people of Europe are opposed to reform. There is only opposition to reform because the people can see that the policies which are being pursued are not fair. Mr Barroso rightly quoted from our study, for example, concerning the question of tax evasion. It is clear that our tax system is often unfair and that it is the rich people who pay no taxes. These are things which we need to change. I am very pleased about what Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said. We have made some progress, but not enough. I am sure that if the people of Europe understood that we will be pursuing more socially just policies in future, they would be prepared to support the necessary reforms. However, what they do not want is for us to give up the European social model which we are so proud of. We Social Democrats support this model and we will defend it with all our strength.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card question. – Mr Swoboda, you brandished your passport and talked of Nicolas Sarkozy. Do you know that Nicolas Sarkozy has always argued in favour of the Schengen agreements? Do you know that Nicolas Sarkozy does not want to get rid of Schengen, but, instead, to strengthen it? Do you know how the border between Greece and Turkey operates? Do you know that in truth, freedom cannot be exercised without security? Mr Swoboda, I have a question to put to you: do you believe that the Schengen provisions are properly managed – yes or no?</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, firstly, Mr Audy, I always think of Mr Sarkozy when I pull out my passport. I will think of him particularly when he has retired and can no longer pursue the policy that he is currently pursuing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, Mr Audy, it is true that security and Schengen go hand in hand. However, I would like to ask you why the Council – and the French Government is not entirely innocent in this respect – is continuing to prevent Bulgaria and Romania from joining the Schengen Area, despite the fact that they have fulfilled all the conditions? I would very much like to ask you this, because now there is security in these countries as a result of the measures that have been taken. Our failure to enlarge the Schengen Area is actually against the law. I am very much in favour of it, but calling it into question in an election campaign, as Mr Sarkozy has done, is reprehensible in my view. Schengen is one of Europe’s major achievements. An achievement of this kind should not be called into question. Instead, it should be supported because it means that we Europeans are able to cross national borders freely without passports. That is what I am standing up for in Europe. If Mr Sarkozy does not do this, then that is his problem, but I and, above all, François Hollande and the French Socialists are standing up for this. For security and freedom!</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I did not intend to get involved in this debate but, Mr Audy, we need to take a serious approach. When I hear it said that half of immigrants should leave France, as President Sarkozy has said, and when I see him attacking halal meat and, at the same time, attacking other partners in relation to Schengen, I wonder who is really the extreme right candidate. Is it Ms Le Pen or Mr Sarkozy?</p>
      <a text="(Protests)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I really do wonder. When I see the way this election campaign is going, I tell myself that we have never seen this sort of thing in any other country.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The problem at the moment is that there is a French President in office using this sort of language.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So let me return to the debate we were having before Mr Audy intervened. First of all, I would like to congratulate President Van Rompuy. European Councils come and go and I feel that I note a terrible complacency. Do we really believe, as was said, that we have reached a turning point in the crisis? Do we really believe that the efforts of Mr Monti and Mr Rajoy will suffice to put an end to the crisis, that the fiscal compact will put an end to the mess, and that it is sufficient to merge the two rescue funds with EUR 750 billion? Do you really think that will end the crisis?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that what is happening for the moment is completely different. What is happening for the moment is that we are seeing a calming down of the bond markets because Mr Draghi has bought us time. He has printed EUR 1 trillion worth of new money. That is what Mr Draghi has done and that is what we are feeling today: the effect of printing new money – EUR 1 trillion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I do not think that that is a real structural solution to this crisis. It could work for a few months or a few weeks, but it will not be a structural solution to this crisis. In fact, we all know what the structural solution for this crisis is. We all know that we need a partial mutualisation of the debt. I was at the US Treasury in Washington and they said that we should do this – create our redemption fund, a structural solution for it. The same thing at the International Monetary Fund. I think that everywhere, they can see the light. It is only in Europe that we do not see the light. We know what it is. It is to mutualise debt above 60% so that everybody pays lower interest rates, including Germany. This is in compliance with the constitutional law in Germany, it is compliant with the international and European treaties, and it is a fund of EUR 2.3 trillion. That is the real firewall.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You talk all the time about a firewall, but there is no firewall even if you merge the two rescue funds. That is a fire extinguisher, not a firewall. It is there if you need it when there is a problem – a crisis in Greece, in Portugal, in Ireland – but not a real firewall around the big economies like Spain and Italy. For that, you need a real redemption fund. And I can assure Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso that I think there is a clear majority on this in this Parliament: we shall not adopt any new legislation related to the euro crisis unless it contains such a proposal.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, a few words on Syria. Yesterday, 47 bodies were found in Homs – the bodies of women and children, stabbed, burned, tortured – and Kofi Annan reports that they do not seem to really understand the reality in Damascus. I think the time is now right to do something. Let us stop all flights to Syria. Let us send back all Syrian ambassadors. Let us prevent all Assad’s friends from travelling and let us do what President Obama is doing, namely, looking into all options – humanitarian corridors, safe havens, assistance to the Free Syrian Army, be it technical or otherwise. But we have to do something and not what we are doing for the moment, which is nothing at all in this case. Otherwise, there is only one outcome – that is that Syria will become a new Srebrenica, a new Sudan, a new Rwanda – and we shall be complicit in that.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card question. – Mr President, I would simply like to know what the reaction of my friend Guy Verhofstadt is, since Mr Sarkozy does not have a representative of the Front national in his government. We have a problem regarding the Netherlands, where the government has never condemned anything. That is much more dangerous and much more insidious.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I think I was the first person to denounce the Dutch Government’s silence on the issue of the website. I must remind my dear friend, Mr Daul, however, that it is a government of Christian Democrats together with Liberals. Perhaps he has forgotten that fact. In any case, I have telephoned Mr Rutte; I do not know whether Mr Daul has telephoned Mr Verhagen.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must say that this afternoon, I am going to be very clear. I am going to support a joint resolution on the website because the Dutch Government’s silence is totally unacceptable. However, I prefer this silence on the part of the Dutch Government to the noise currently being made by Mr Sarkozy about the xenophobic, racist affair.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether I should congratulate you, Mr Van Rompuy, or whether we should congratulate ourselves: we shall see. I hope that your second term of office will not be like the first.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to say various things.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, to come back to Schengen, I should like a very simple thing to be said. Germany and France are isolated in the Council. At the Council, all the countries have refused to renationalise the management of Schengen. That is what this is about: saying that reform is necessary. Mr Audy, if you wish, for Greece, if one were to stop provoking the Turks with totally idiotic resolutions in the national parliaments, it might be possible to conclude an agreement with them for them to secure the borders. We hit out at them, and then we say to them: ‘be nice to us’. They are just as clever or stupid as we are! Let us put our own house in order, and perhaps we will be able to secure the border with Greece by having better relations with Turkey.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is not nonsense, it is the truth, my dear friend, and you are going to hear some more of it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to turn now to the crisis. I believe that this approach to the golden rule, where we adopt a triple financial, social and environmental golden rule, makes sense. I am not opposed to a financial golden rule, but if we do not adopt a social and an environmental golden rule alongside it, we will not be doing right by future generations. That is what I wanted to say about the golden rule.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Starting from there, what we need to do now is to produce a recovery plan, but not on a shoestring. As you know, we have staked EUR 4 600 billion in order to save the banks. This was made up of guarantees, investments and various ways of saving the financial system. The Marshall Plan was 5% of US GDP; 5% of European GDP is EUR 800 billion, not EUR 4 000 billion. This is a recovery plan for the European economy, including the economies of Greece, Portugal, Spain, etc. Let us be equal to the challenge. We will not overcome the crisis merely through austerity policies that strangle the people; we will only do so if we give the people prospects for the future. We have had to pull out all the stops to save the financial system. Are we not capable of pulling out all the stops to save European citizens? Anyway, that seems to me to go without saying. What I am calling for is that we should make use of a significant European budget – Mr Daul is right – using own resources and the European Investment Bank, in order to implement a lasting and sustainable economic recovery with the green economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to tax evasion, I should like to say that we must be honest. As long as we continue to have fiscal competition in Europe, we will not succeed. Allow me to cite an example: Facebook and Apple are in Ireland, and Google and Amazon are in Luxembourg, while they make their money in France, Germany, etc. These companies pay taxes in Luxembourg or in Ireland because there is unfair competition on company taxation. As long as we are unable to regulate this, let us not say that we are combating tax evasion. If you want to combat tax evasion, it is very simple. All you have to say is: ‘all banks who do business in Europe, whether they be European, Swiss or foreign, must declare what European residents deposit in their banks, all the banks, otherwise they will be prohibited from working in the European market’. That is what the Americans did with UBS in the case of US money in Switzerland and you have seen how the Swiss banks reacted, saying: ‘here are the declarations’. Do the same thing! Compel the banks to make declarations. Of course, that constitutes a temporary removal of banking secrecy. If you tackle this, then you can tackle tax evasion, because you know where it is and where it comes from. For as long as we fail to do this, we will not be equal to the challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should now like to finish with two issues. Regarding Bosnia and Belgrade, I am not in agreement. As long as we fail to give Bosnia a chance, those who were responsible for the war will be the major beneficiaries, and those who were the victims of the war – Bosnia – will not even have a makeshift role within Europe. I find this morally unjustifiable. I am not opposed to the agreement with Serbia but I would say we are not doing enough for Bosnia. While we fail to tackle Dayton, we will not make progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, on the subject of Syria, Mr Verhofstadt is right. Today, we are imposing a humanitarian corridor, but we are not saying that we are doing anything. I agree that Syria is isolated, and there are all the options: arming the army, seeing if we should act to impose humanitarian corridors, etc. Mr Van Rompuy, you speak of a humanitarian corridor, but if Mr Assad does not want one, what will you do? Will you impose it or not? This is something we must consider. The Syrian people are being massacred every day, and our discussions are not keeping pace with the massacre. That is our problem. I am not saying that I have the solution, but at the moment, we are not able to be equal to the task.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am becoming increasingly concerned that a sort of corrupting complacency is starting to take hold in EU corridors of power. Many seem to now believe that the worst of the crisis is over. After all, we have signed the new treaty to solve it all, and some are implying that Europe is really OK; the only problem is that a few Mediterranean countries have a problem with their public finances and it is nothing that the new treaty cannot put right. Well, Europe is not OK. The underlying economic weakness is a problem shared by the whole of our continent and the new treaty is simply an irrelevance to most of it.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pleased to say that two Member States, both from parties led by my group, have been honest enough to say that there is no point in signing this treaty. Others have signed it and have indicated that they do not really believe that it applies to them. Before the ink was even dry on the treaty, Spain and the Netherlands said that they were not going to comply with its provisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council has wasted considerable energy on a treaty that will make no practical difference to the fundamentals, whilst taking decisions at the same time that will condemn the Greek people to a generation of poverty. Greece now faces the prospect of one of the longest recessions in recorded history, a collapse in living standards and levels of unemployment unseen in Europe since the 1930s. The solution, of course, is not easy and it is not without cost, but a new course must surely now be followed. Measures are required so that Greece can organise an orderly default, but a default that needs to be complemented by leaving the euro so that devaluation can save its economy in the short term, while structural reforms are taken to rebuild it in the medium term.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the complacency shown when it comes to the fundamental state of the EU economy is equally profoundly shocking. There was a letter, signed by 12 Heads of Government, from three political families in this House, which was presented to the Council. It was an opportunity to relaunch a constructive growth agenda in Europe, but the initial reaction was very cool, as you know, Mr Van Rompuy. Surely, the time has now come for you to stop behaving as if Council communiqués have been delegated to the foreign ministries of France and Germany. Why did you not immediately face the opportunity to focus on a positive forward-looking agenda for real economic growth? Perhaps, when you asked the Council to put jobs on the agenda, you were, in fact, only referring to yours – congratulations on your reappointment, by the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Barroso, should this not be the kind of growth agenda that is the centre piece of the work of your Commission and should define its purpose? Is that not what we were promised? The global competitive challenge requires a determined policy response from the whole Commission, not just from one or two Commissioners who understand what is at stake. Perhaps the Commission should spend a little more time on pursing real reform and a little less time on producing silly, racist, martial arts videos.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope that you will also take this opportunity to condemn Sunday’s remarks from the President of France calling for restriction, calling for more protectionism on trade. We should be abolishing trade barriers, not erecting more of them. Apparently, last week, President Sarkozy also said that there are too many foreigners in France. Well, I am a foreigner in France and I say to him that I would be very happy not to have to come back to this Parliament in France every month – and it is his government that actually makes us come here in the first place. There are several hundred foreigners who would be very happy not to come back to France every month if that is really what President Sarkozy wants.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Firstly, of course, I am happy to say that I am not a spokesman for the British Government, but I think that George Osborne has made the position very clear.

      <p sl="en">I can have an opinion on whether it is wise for them to stay in the euro or not and I have expressed that opinion, but the actual fundamentals of it are for them themselves to decide, for elected politicians in Greece to make that decision.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I have to say I marvel every time that Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy can keep a straight face when they say that our strategy is starting to work and when they talk about job-creating growth. The strategy that they are pursuing, which is an onslaught on people’s living standards and an onslaught on society in Greece, has resulted in the highest level of unemployment across the EU since the introduction of the euro – 25 million people. It has resulted in a contraction of the eurozone at the end of 2011. They want to institutionalise synchronised austerity right across Europe with their fiscal treaty but, at the same time, they like to talk about growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was Winston in George Orwell’s 1984 who said that freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four. So let me say clearly that trying to meet the structural deficit targets under Article 3 and the debt reduction targets under Article 4 of this treaty equals savage austerity across Europe. It means 5.7 billion euros’ worth of extra cuts and taxes in Ireland; tens of billions of euros across the eurozone. It means, without economic growth, repayment to the bondholders of four and a half billion euros in principal repayments on top of the interest in Ireland; over a hundred billion across the eurozone. It does not mean growth; it means more unemployment; it means a worsening crisis; it means worsening public services and worsening working conditions. Because of this, in Ireland, the government’s only argument in this debate is based on fear. The centrepiece of their scaremongering is the clause which is inserted into the new ESM Treaty which says that only countries that sign up to this permanent austerity can access the ESM funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, can I ask you a direct question, for which I would like an answer? How did this blackmail clause come to be inserted into the new ESM Treaty? Who proposed this blackmail clause? Did the Irish Government raise any objection to the creation of a stick that is simply there to beat the Irish people with, to try and get us to vote for permanent austerity? Finally, is it not the case that the amendment to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to allow the ESM to come into being has still not been ratified by the Member States and therefore, if the Irish Government is serious about a fair and free debate without this threat hanging over our heads, it has the power to refuse to ratify and allow this ESM Treaty to come into being – unless the clause is removed?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I see that Mr Van Rompuy is back for another two-and-a-half years, no doubt a reward for his great success. Indeed, Mr Van Rompuy, listening to you, I thought perhaps I had got it all wrong. You talked about how positive the last Council meeting had been, that we have reached the turning point, that everything is going swimmingly, and I was beginning to believe it.</p>
      <p sl="en">And then I realised that you did not mention the D word: Default. No, that cannot be talked about. We pretend there has not been a default when we know, in fact, that in Greece last week, there was a very major credit event. Indeed, listening to all of you this morning reminds me of the great British comedy classic Carry On Up the Khyber , where the colonial English go on having dinner, ignoring the fact that impending disaster is all around them.</p>
      <p sl="en">You are determined but delusional in this attempt to keep the euro propped up. And whilst you are enjoying your dinner, incoming shells are landing all around you: youth unemployment in Greece went through 50% last week. That is fine, carry on, serve the main course. And you will have seen yesterday that 110 German bondholders of Greek bonds are now going to take legal action against the banks and against the Greek Government. But do not worry chaps; carry on; everything is going to be fine. But perhaps the biggest bombshell is the German Finance Minister saying just yesterday that nobody can exclude a third bail-out. Pass the port. Do enjoy the party.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is a farcical situation, and why is it happening? That is what people in Europe want to know. Why is this happening? Is this being done to help Greece? No. It is going to crucify Greece. It is being done to prop up a failing project because you know that once Greece goes, others will go as well. And some of the language is telling. Mr Barroso, when leaders stand up and say that political moves are irreversible, history has one lesson: you are always, always, going to be proved to be wrong.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first, I would like to give Mr Swoboda some information about one thing. Since the Schengen agreements have been in existence, I have to present my passport, or at least one form of identification, not only at the borders but also during journeys within a country. When I return from Strasbourg to Lyon, I have to present my identification at check-in, and again on boarding. That is very strange: since the disappearance of checks at the external borders, there have been checks everywhere. That is the first point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My second point, if I may say so, is for Mr Verhofstadt, that great democrat and former prime minister of a country which banned its main opposition force – the Vlaams Blok – and which now wants to block websites. He finds it very racist to refer to the fact that people in France are obliged to eat halal meat when they are not Muslims. However, that is not all, Mr Verhofstadt. I heard on the television this morning, for instance, that mosques were burning in Brussels, but we must certainly not talk about that either. Soon, you will ban the websites that report this. I salute your deep liberalism.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Council that we are considering today is not a last-chance one, which is a highly exceptional fact. We have sacrificed Greece, and for the moment, the markets have been appeased. We are told that it is a council of stability, coordination and governance. The stability in question is stability in the denial of democracy, since the people will not be asked to make a decision. The coordination in question is that of austerity plans and insecurity, while the governance is that strange mix of bureaucracy and plutocracy that orders people around and which, for some time now, has been claiming an increasing right to do so, with apparently increasing authoritarianism and ferocity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, the statement that we have not yet emerged from the crisis and still have a number of tasks to complete was correct. However, it is also true and is also worth mentioning that some of the work has been done and that we are on the right track. Part of the process of solving major problems is to keep your spirits up and to ask yourself, when you have made some progress, whether this is the right way forward or the wrong one. I believe that debates of the kind we had initially, which were like election campaign events, do not help at all in encouraging young people to commit to the future and to Europe. They are not of any benefit and simply cause harm.</p>
      <p sl="de">To go back to the subject of organising growth and stability, if we want to promote positive economic growth in Europe and to ensure that people in Europe and, in particular, young people have a future, then we need to use the funds available to us wisely and finally come to grips with the things that have often happened in the past. Spending our money with care is not about imposing extreme austerity measures, but about using money honestly and sensibly. That is where we have made all our mistakes. More in some areas and fewer in others. We have not done a good enough job of ensuring that things did not get out of hand. If we want to make progress and stimulate growth, that does not mean throwing more money around, organising a few more programmes and writing a few more road maps, which no one understands anyway, but it means putting structures in place and creating incentives. Some Member States and some national economies are flourishing. Why is this? Because they have implemented structural reforms, invested in industry and had the courage not to regulate everything down to the smallest detail. If we were all to get together and think about whether the agreements or new regulations that we are introducing were absolutely necessary, and if we were to consider more carefully where innovations and research could be promoted, we would probably do more for growth in Europe than we do with the many speeches that we make here. We need courage, commitment and trust in people, and in young people in particular. This is why I think we need fewer regulations and more innovation and research. We also need fewer words and more real policies when we make decisions here every day. That is what I would like to see happening.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the most important reform to implement is to reduce the number of summits of Heads of State or Government. They are practically useless. If the euro is doing better, it is because of the action taken by the European Central Bank and Mario Draghi. In fact, the announcement of summits gives rise to futile hopes. That was the case of the most recent summit, which produced a few empty words on stronger growth but nothing tangible, for instance, on combating youth unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What is more, back at home, the leaders’ fine European professions of faith evaporate. President Sarkozy claims to be leading Europe and boasted of having created the Treaty of Lisbon. Now, as an electoral candidate, Mr Sarkozy is threatening to leave Schengen. Has he not yet noticed that the Schengen agreements are an integral part of the Treaty, Article 67 of which makes the ‘absence of internal border controls for persons mandatory? In order to leave Schengen, France would therefore have to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any case, I wonder what Mr Sarkozy wants to check. Is it the 1.4 billion annual movements at internal borders? Is it the millions of tourists that flock to France every summer? Is it the half a million French people who are frontier workers in neighbouring countries? All these populist initiatives merely serve to conceal the inability of the leaders to commit to a real growth policy. This was apparent in the case of Greece, where Europe imposed measures that have led to a contraction in domestic demand, the bankruptcy of 200 000 small and medium-sized enterprises and the erosion of the purchasing power of the Greeks. Now, Greece’s growth is at a standstill.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we all agree that we want a stability culture in Europe. That is at least what we are constantly hearing. We also need to assess what has been achieved with the fiscal compact, which represents an important step towards the stability culture. It is not a turning point and it is not the solution. It is also not a universal remedy. We can all agree on that. However, I believe that it is an important step forward, and this needs to be said for the sake of truth.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want balanced budgets with very low primary deficits, if these cannot be avoided. We want a debt brake in the euro area countries. We want automatic sanctions for offenders before things go wrong. We want old debts to be reduced and the results to be reported to Brussels before new debts are incurred. We want the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to come into effect earlier. We must also make sure that only those countries which join the fiscal compact have access to the ESM.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are all important elements of a stability culture in Europe and, with the ‘two-pack’, we are attempting to implement this under European law, including a debt redemption pact, which is something my group is specifically calling for. We want to stimulate growth in Greece and the money to do this is available. Between EUR 16 billion and EUR 18 billion – the numbers vary – can be provided from the Structural Funds. I believe that we finally need to get started with this. Everything that Mr Reichenbach and the Troika have so far achieved in Greece is not enough to give a real boost to growth. Then, today, there was a debate in the German Parliament which surprised me, because the Social Democrats are threatening to vote against the fiscal compact unless it includes a particular tax, which would justifiably be controversial. I believe this would be a huge mistake. I also think it is important for the Social Democrats to become aware of their responsibilities in terms of stability policy and to vote in favour of the compact without playing party political games.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the central issue for us is to make progress on the road towards a stability culture. I would like to finish by congratulating you, Mr Van Rompuy, on your reappointment. Everyone agrees that you are doing an excellent job. However, I am still of the opinion that your position, as it is enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, is a mistake. I would prefer to have a President of Europe who, if possible, was also directly elected.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Barroso, you have rightly spoken about tax evasion. You know that this struggle is extremely important for us, because it is a struggle that revolves around economic efficiency and social justice. Talking about these matters is all very well, but we would like to see action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Where are the Commission’s statements? Where is the pressure from the Commission to help Greece to try to recover the EUR 100 to 200 billion that are in Switzerland, according to the Greek Government’s estimates? I know that this is not necessarily Greece’s priority. Greece holds the primary responsibility for this inability to genuinely levy tax. All the same, where is the action by the Commission to exert pressure on Switzerland, so that the money can be taxed and then return to Greece?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Just now, Daniel Cohn-Bendit was talking about what President Obama did in relation to the Swiss banks and banking secrecy. Where is the initiative by the European Commission to do exactly what Mr Obama did, namely, to impose an extra-territorial law that is binding and eliminates banking secrecy? Where is the Commission’s initiative to have a European list of tax havens? On the OECD’s blacklist, there is one state, or two states, or, from time to time, three states; they sign mutual conventions, and then there is no one left on the list. All of a sudden, the struggle is empty, because the blacklist is empty. Where is the Commission’s initiative? I want to see concrete answers, because it is all very well to make these grand declarations before Parliament, but it is actually much better to take tangible political action to put pressure on these states. I am fully aware that these states constitute the main obstacle to progress. We need you, however, to put pressure on the states.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, I would like to put a final question to you, not about tax havens, but about austerity. When we have informal discussions with your departments and those of the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, this is what your officials tell us. When you put all the austerity policies and the requirements that have now been imposed by the Commission to reduce budget deficits into the same economic model, it is not possible to show that there is truly a path that will enable us to reduce the deficits. In fact, growth is being damaged to such a degree, and tax revenue is being decreased to such an extent, that the end result is a greater deficit, not a lower one. That is the case, for example, in Spain. The debate is also a live issue in the Netherlands, and perhaps soon will be in France too.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, the reality is that when you use these figures, it does not work. When are you going to admit this? When are you going to change direction?</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, a cartoon came out some time ago – in the Greek newspapers, I think – of Chancellor Merkel with a swastika on her sleeve, while the German newspapers were again writing about what a lazy lot the Greeks were. Is this normal? For me, it is unacceptable. I also wonder whether it was European integration that brought us to this pass, where European nations stick two fingers up and spit at each other. I have to say, unfortunately, that this is the case. This is indeed the result of a concept of European integration that is yours, yours and yours. The fiscal compact is just one further step on this path, which has nothing to do with fiscal discipline – itself a healthy and necessary thing – but only with creating a pretext for the further politicisation of the EU, and a further step towards political union, which, as is abundantly obvious, does not eliminate tension between nations, but increases it and revives old animosities. My own government did not sign the fiscal compact, and we have to decide whether to join the euro area at all, which must be the subject of a referendum, because the terms of accession to the euro area have changed dramatically from the situation when we signed the accession treaty, and it is therefore necessary for the citizens of the country to decide the matter in a popular vote.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, all of you standing before me: two years ago, the leaders of the European Union and the Greek Prime Minister subjected the people of my country to a massive experiment. Greece was turned into a vehicle of the International Monetary Fund in the euro area. Today, the International Monetary Fund forms part of the institutional framework of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Greek experiment involves wage cuts, pension cuts, bonus cuts, cuts in spending on schools and hospitals, cuts to benefits and the abolition of collective agreements. What is the result of this experiment? Production declined by 7% last year, there are 1 million unemployed according to official figures, and 1.5 million according to unofficial figures, shops are closing down, workers are not being paid and the nation is feeling insulted and unhappy. Greece has gone bankrupt and the cost is being paid by its citizens, its young people and its families. The benefits are being reaped by the banks.</p>
      <p sl="el">What have you decided now in the Council, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy? What are you discussing today? You have decided to let the idea of Europe go bankrupt. You have decided to let the idea of solidarity go bankrupt. You have decided on a Europe of strict fiscal prudence, a German Europe. You have decided on a Europe in which one person snitches on another, a Europe which is fearful of its people, a Europe which is fearful of referenda and the voice of the people.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, you should know that the people have not gone bankrupt and that they will shortly give their response and will trash such memoranda, contracts and treaties.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have this morning heard many criticisms of the French President’s electoral posturing on immigration and on Schengen. This criticism has been developed from the point of view and through the lens of populism. Fair enough.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to apply the same analysis to the news in all the major European dailies yesterday and today. I am referring to the important stance taken by the greatest progressive European philosopher, the elderly but very clear-sighted Mr Habermas, who has looked at the reform, the fiscal compact, from a very specific point of view. He says that this reform, this pact, should not be approved because it is like wanting to increase, or rather, fooling ourselves that we want to increase, integration among Member States without civic integration among citizens. He says that it highlights the fact that only a democratic Europe, only popular will – even expressed through a referendum I would say, but that is my opinion – could produce politically credible decisions. He calls the European Union arrogant in its dealings with citizens and dominated by speculators.</p>
      <p sl="it">I had grown used to quoting Junger, but from now on, I will quote Habermas when criticising, from a populist and democratic point of view, your bad decisions which impact on the people. Maybe they are taken by the inner circle – the inner circle of the Bilderberg or Trilateral meetings – but they are obviously not taken here. Such decisions are then imposed on the people, without caring one jot about the real economy of those who work and sweat, workers and entrepreneurs.</p>

This important committee warned of economic instability, political unrest on the continent and a rise in the number of economic migrants fleeing the chaos of the eurozone and arriving at our borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current crisis, illegal immigration has become such a problem that – as we have heard many times this morning – this week, President Sarkozy has threatened to withdraw France from the Schengen Agreement. In the long term, the committee has stated that eurozone countries may be unable to maintain their national defences, jeopardising the security of Europe and the integrity of NATO.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I felt obliged to begin with Mr Swoboda’s proud defence of the welfare system, as I do not believe that the claims made by the President of the European Central Bank should be read ideologically, rather, they look to me like a statement of fact: there are 500 million people in the EU, of which 75 million are under 25; if we think of Egypt, it is a country of 80 million people, and 60 million are under 25. This raises real questions about the size and structure of our welfare system, and we have to give real answers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The truth is, when it comes to huge and genuine problems, European leaders go back and forth between populist outbursts, which get them into trouble and force them to pander to public opinion, and pragmatic solutions, which must be the main way to work out the timeframe for the recovery and the means by which it can be achieved.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to have a truly pragmatic approach, we have to focus everything on the instrument that we designed, as an institution, for this purpose. That means we have got to look to the Commission to impose itself on governments and, at the same time, nurture public debate among our citizens so as to create a practical consensus to Europe as a project.</p>
      <p sl="it">We have got to strengthen the Commission right this instant. We have to strengthen the Commission, and Parliament must play a strategic role in this process. Otherwise, in quarrelling with governments which are increasingly dragged into things in the name of increasingly populist public opinion, we will be forced into an unprecedented capitulation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would ask the President of the Commission why it is that the second Greek package will not work. It is for the same reason that the first did not work: because what is important is not the size of the countries’ debt, but rather their ability to manage the resources for paying this debt.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The Troika’s obsession with fiscal rigour is imposing payments, apparently unchecked, on the Greek economy that are pushing it year after year into a never-ending recession; it is not very clear to whom they answer. In a recession, there is no way of paying. In an economy in which exports account for no more than 20% of production, reducing wages and increasing taxes will not increase competitiveness, but will simply crush domestic demand.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Next year, Greece will have been in recession for five consecutive years; that is unique in European history. In 2011, production declined by 7%, 200 000 companies went out of business and unemployment hit 23% of the active population. Since the Troika came to Greece, 32 new types of tax have been introduced and there has been a 50% drop in disposable income.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, the question is, what will be the source of the dynamic enabling Greece to pay that which it has borrowed and owes? Meanwhile, the second package provides for a primary surplus of 4.5%, in order for its targets to be hit. What is the source of Greece’s growth?</p>
      <p sl="pt">Meanwhile, the Troika recommendations accompanying the second package prescribe wage cuts of 22%, and of 32% for young people. The question is, are we at a turning point with the contamination existing in Europe? The situation we are in is certainly an emergency. Either sovereign debt is mutualised quickly and a veritable Marshall Plan for growth in Europe is launched, particularly for the countries that are currently in difficulties, or our turning point will, unfortunately, lead us off a cliff edge.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Saying this is regrettable, but I think the warning must be set out in a very clear way.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I warmly welcome the Council decision to grant Serbia candidate status. It is a hugely positive step forward and recognition of Serbia’s reform effort. It is also an important step forward for all the neighbours and the region as a whole. This is also a last and dramatic wake-up call to Macedonia, which has been waiting in vain for the opening of accession negotiations for the past seven years.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite certain setbacks and delays, Belgrade has acted responsibly and engaged seriously in a dialogue with Priština. Implementation of all agreements reached to date has begun. I hope the authorities will keep up this positive momentum and continue with implementation in good faith, including integrated border management.</p>
      <p sl="en">The outstanding issue in Serbia today is systemic corruption and the political influence of the judiciary. Serbian leaders need to do more in the fight against corruption, while at the same time ensuring a genuine rule of law in the country. This is needed to make possible the early opening of Chapters 23 and 24 of the accession negotiations. I hope Serbia will remain ambitious in striving for the quick opening of accession negotiations. It is essential that Belgrade keeps its constructive approach towards Kosovo during and after the election campaign. The so-called parallel structures in north Kosovo must begin to be carefully removed so that EULEX and KFOR can fully execute their mandate.</p>

      <p sl="en">We all know the magnitude of this crisis, but I believe that crisis demands radical rethinking; it is a time to seize new opportunities, to learn from past mistakes and make sure that we do not repeat them. The European economy has to be put on a path that will equip it for future challenges, for example, investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that we know will create thousands of sustainable jobs as well as protecting the environment.</p>

In 2010, Mr Barroso said the euro is a protection shield against the crisis, but the euro fuelled the crisis – cheap money generated debt and bubbles. Last year, Mr Van Rompuy said the fundamentals of the euro are sound, yet the euro caused a huge competitiveness gap in its own zone. Last year, he said that stress tests show that European banks were doing well; recently, the ECB injected EUR 1 trillion to prevent their collapse. Last weekend, he said the worst of the crisis is behind us; on the same day, German Minister of Finance Mr Schäuble, said Greece may need a third bail-out. The day before, the President of the ECB, Mr Draghi, predicted that there was more economic contraction to come, and Spain announced it would break the fiscal compact shortly after signing it.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, all the conclusions of the European Council represent is the institutionalisation of the same policies that led to the present tragic social situation, which are deepening it by increasing unemployment, by reducing wages, by scaling back the welfare state and by abolishing public services. Behind the technocratic language and words about budgetary consolidation is hidden this single reality: families being condemned to poverty and despair.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Reaffirming the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, of the Stability and Growth Pact, of economic governance and of the Euro Plus Pact translates to attacks on wages, to an assault on labour and social rights, to the facilitation of redundancies, and to the privatisation of public services; in other words, to the peoples giving up their collective wealth. At the same time as this is being imposed on the workers, the European Central Bank is injecting EUR 500 billion of liquidity into private banks, at 1% interest rates.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The signing of the so-called fiscal compact and the European Stability Mechanism treaty, in breach of the European Union’s own rules, constitutes an unacceptable assault on the sovereignty of the Member States, which are losing the capacity for sovereign decisions on budgetary matters, so paving the way for the establishment of colonial-type relationships in the European Union, in which big capital rules, alongside the major powers, such as Germany.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In case you had not noticed, ladies and gentlemen, the peoples and workers of Europe are fighting this course of action.

However, when considering the future, we should remember the words spoken right here by the Italian Prime Minister Professor Monti – that democracy and globalisation can and must live alongside one another. Indeed, if we want to preserve Europe as a Union of sovereign states, we must, in principle, change our attitude to responsibility. Member State governments must follow responsible policies and if such policies actually become every country’s alpha and omega, then there will be no need for any fiscal discipline treaties. We will only be able to save the European Union if Member States follow such a principle and handle their finances responsibly, and pay due attention to promoting the single market, innovations and research.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in the conclusions of the European Council of 1-2 March, towards the end, in the section ‘Any other business’, in paragraph 45, to be exact, a grand total of two whole lines were devoted to the fact that Herman Van Rompuy had been reappointed President of the European Council. My sincere congratulations, Mr Van Rompuy, but this may well be an indication that there is something wrong with the democratic legitimacy of the whole way that the European Union functions.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You talked about a turning point and said you had found the banks willing to write off a large proportion of the Greek debt. I fear that you are continuing to give a somewhat rosy picture of the situation, because, fundamentally, nothing has changed. Soon, Greece will again be receiving a new multi-billion euro handout and then, as usual, it will only be a matter of time before it needs more money. This is why we are all going to continue muddling on, with no prospect of anything improving.</p>

Yet another bailout will not do anything to change that situation.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, President Van Rompuy, first of all, let me congratulate you on your reappointment, Mr Van Rompuy. I am among those who, since you were first appointed, have been trying to explain to citizens that your task is a difficult one. I hope that you will continue to execute it with just as much persistence. I know that it is difficult.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about citizens. I am sorry to have to say today that Europe is losing its credibility. I will not get involved in the national electoral battle: this is neither the time nor the place for that. One may, however, ask why such statements may be publicly accepted. Due to the fact that they are not rejected by public opinion, they are adopted by a very large majority simply because our fellow citizens no longer have any faith in Europe. It may be possible to exercise faith in certain areas. However, I believe that for Europe, what we need is reality.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, I admire all those who, every month, or every week, make their speeches once again to say the same thing, and I pity those who write them, because what our citizens are looking for is action, and not words. We should spend less time speaking and more time taking action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, there are various causes behind the weakening of Europe. The first is, clearly, the way that the crisis has led to nations turning in on themselves. Each country is seeing things only from its point of view, looking at what is going on nationally without taking into account the European dimension, which is the only one that might save us. The second cause is the weakening of the Commission. The Commission appears silent. I am not saying that the Commission is not doing anything: it is working, but no one notices what it is actually doing because there is no clear plan. What is missing is a small package of specific actions that would allow citizens to compare what has been announced with what has been done.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let us take the case of Greece. It is very clear that Greece’s situation is tragic. Why are we giving the impression that it has now been resolved? It has not. One problem has been resolved to allow the plan to work, but in another year or two, problems will arise once again, because strong measures need to be taken. In addition, in the ‘two-pack’ that has been mentioned, I am proposing a safeguard measure for countries in difficulty. However, I was told by the Commission that it was an attack on the market. In fact, when you talk to the markets, what they want is to know where we are going and how we are getting there. They want to stick with the measures that have been taken, and not to change them every fortnight.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, first of all, I would like to say here that I think what is in the treaty could very well appear in European law, and on this point I believe I am in agreement with the Commission. This was said just now by President Barroso, when he stated that the Commission is making proposals to include a number of parties. Therefore, I do not intend to withdraw anything at all. I believe that we need rigour. Only a fool builds his house on the sand. If we now want to get the situation back on track, we must simultaneously balance rigour and growth. Growth, however, is not to be sought in newspaper articles or theories. Growth must be found in innovation, in entrepreneurship, in the mobilisation of entrepreneurs and in confidence. That is what we should work on together.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, congratulations. The conclusions of the meeting of the European Council take up 12 pages, something more than 300 lines, but not a single line on the possibly irreparable damage that is being done to the European political project.</p>
      <p sl="es">Europe is a project of competitive economy, citizenship and social model. The competitive economy cannot move forward without policies for growth. Citizenship takes a step back with proposals such as those put forward by Mr Sarkozy in relation to Schengen and the social model suffers when the trade unions are attacked, when social dialogue is weakened, and that is happening in many countries, including Spain.</p>
      <p sl="es">The people who are destroying the European political project today are the leaders who park their Europeanism when they are facing difficult elections; elections that are difficult for them, not for their countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">The people who are attacking the European model today are those who confront Europe with their fearful, national public opinions. That is not leadership; it is opportunism, populism, and I think it is time that the debate on these matters also finds its place in the European Council.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, keeping the EU together despite the tensions that exist between regions and countries is now the most important task for the leaders of the Union. President Sarkozy ought to stop and think and not incite nationalist sentiments. History ought to have taught him that lesson.</p>
      <p sl="sv">In the European Parliament’s annual tax report, for which I was responsible, we state that extensive and sustainable budgetary consolidation is necessary, but we must also focus on growth. It is a question of how, at national and EU level, we can create more growth in Europe and therefore a higher level of employment. What is particularly important is that we consider how we can improve the internal market and create a more competitive Europe.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Combating youth unemployment, promoting growth and conditions for small enterprises and removing tax obstacles are crucial. We risk leaving a whole generation in Europe without the hope of a better future.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Let me end by saying that when listening to Mr Farage, Mr Eppink, Mr Gollnisch and the others, I think that sometimes they ought to remember what European history is all about. I think that we in this Chamber ought to remember this. Previously in history, Mr Gollnisch, we solved the problem on the battlefield. We do not do that now. I listen to you, you listen to me, and I think that is the way we should all prefer the history of Europe. Mr Gollnisch, I think you are damaging the European idea of working together, and it is not our fault; I think you should also consider your own responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, at a future time of financial stability, it will be appropriate that all measures as defined in the original Stability and Growth Pact are adhered to by all governments. However, when Parliament discussed the economic governance package of legislation, this House also acknowledged that sanctions and fines only work once countries have returned to a path of stability, already in conformity with the Stability and Growth Pact, and, above all, have returned to economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is therefore disingenuous of the Commission to overrule the new government of Spain when it comes to the implementation of the agreed structural reforms and their corresponding deficit reduction. If the Spanish Government’s statement about the 2011 deviation of two and a half percent of the public deficit, together with drastically changed economic growth forecasts, will make the previously set target unachievable, then why will the Commission not revisit the targets? At a time of crisis, targets should be fluid and amended as appropriate, given changing economics.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to give Member States that are truly committed to the reform programme the time and leeway to meet the longer-term competitiveness goals in the best way for them. Each Member State will need to take specific measures to return to economic health and should not be sacrificed – in the words of the Euro Group President, Mr Juncker – to maintaining the credibility of new EU rules.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what will the citizens of Europe think of the way in which we are handling the crisis after the last summit? They will realise that the banks are receiving around EUR 1 trillion from the European Central Bank (ECB) without any conditions being imposed on them. No strings are attached to this money and the banks can use it for whatever purpose they want.</p>
      <p sl="de">In contrast, the countries that are in crisis are being gagged and forced to introduce disastrous austerity measures. The citizens of the crisis countries are having to put up with cuts in their pay, pensions and social security benefits.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, unlike Germany, the economies of these crisis countries are not dependent on exports, but on their own internal markets. It is precisely these markets which are being destroyed by the austerity policies that have been imposed. This is not the right way to get out of the crisis, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy. In political terms, the EU is being driven into a brick wall.</p>

      <p sl="el">Apparently, tax evasion at European level is spiralling out of control. The insurance problem is the next time bomb in the foundations of the system. Unemployment is snowballing. Unemployment in Greece topped 21% in December. One in two young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.

An example of this is the ‘two-pack’. However, one thing is clear. The Europe 2020 strategy calls for us to move forward as quickly as possible. The internal market must be completed and we need to promote innovation and research in order to create jobs. However, I am extremely concerned about youth unemployment. We must do everything we can to reduce the current figures and give young people a fair chance. I believe that increased investment in education and training represents the best way of ensuring that young people have the right opportunities.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think time flies quicker than the Councils are able to meet. On the economic crisis, nearly everything has been said but actions – as we witness here – are not considered to be sufficient. We obviously need both consolidation and growth, but we should practise growth and not preach. You can decree austerity and sanctions but you cannot decree growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">This debate reminds me of the Realsozialismus debates and decreeing growth in the so-called Socialist countries. First, we have to mutualise debt and then to create growth bonds – not stability, not project, but growth bonds – using the EIB EIF facility. But we tend to forget the context of the crisis which is, first, collective fatigue, the fading away of political will and a rise in national egoism. Secondly, nationalistic sentiments, such as the Wilders Internet site, appear, along with the risk of spreading this nationalism all over Europe in this time of crisis, violating the fundamental values and freedom of movement in the European Union. Third comes the collateral damage this crisis is doing to foreign policy, which is getting weaker and weaker, and to the risk of Schengen being dismantled. The fourth risk, in this context, is double standards being applied. Greece: an admirable saving operation to be applauded, not only for economic reasons but on the grounds of solidarity, and also for geopolitical reasons, because Greece is the eastern flank of the Union – but the worst economic performer in the Union today.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, we have a different standard being applied to Hungary, which, having being left by the Socialist government of Gyurcsány with an economy in a catastrophic state, has made courageous efforts to reduce debt and has been blindly punished by President Barroso’s Commission. Today, Spain is getting concessions to lower its deficit target: 0.25 for Hungary is punished while a +1.4 deficit target for Spain is rewarded. What signal does this send to the sinners and the reformers? Is it the difference between being in the euro area and outside? This is not a coherent policy.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Vice-President, may I ask you to deliver a message to our President, to thank him and congratulate him on his action at the European Council? I believe that he had a significant impact on the debates by posing the question that is key for European identity: both that of the European social model and that of the democratic legitimacy of the processes embarked upon. This European Council has seen the signing of a treaty when even a government that is one of the most fervent advocates of a ‘Merkozy’ strategy now finds itself in difficulty. In my view, neither Spain nor the Netherlands could reasonably apply this treaty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have understood, though, that in parallel, suddenly, our leaders have apparently discovered that they must also talk of growth, but not in the same way, not with the same golden rules, but with soft rules. I must say to you that there will be no more growth if you only apply the rule of the internal market, which is just a rule of negative integration, whereas your conclusions turn their back on the balance that had been enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy. You are unravelling this strategy and rewriting it after less than two years. The destruction of the European social model will not bring about more growth. There will not be more growth while those who claim they want to protect it are undermining the foundations of European identity. There will be more growth if you think, first and foremost, about jobs, joint industrial strategies, a European energy community and specific combating of tax evasion, instead of waiting countless months before negotiating and denouncing the unilateral strategies of some Member States. There will be no growth without consistent commitments by the Member States when we negotiate the financial framework and the introduction of an own resource on the basis of Eurobonds and a tax on financial transactions.</p>

    <intervention id="2-057-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I will respond specifically to the questions that have been raised. First of all, there was a question on the letter from the 12 governments. I said at the European Council meeting that I could endorse practically every word of that letter. They were all elements that were very important for growth, particularly the development of the internal market and structural reforms. However, I also pointed out to the Member States two aspects which seemed important to me. First of all, there is no reference in the letter to the social dimension or the need to combat poverty. I believe that we need to combine a number of structural reform measures with measures that are proactive in social terms. Secondly, I made clear to the European Council how shocked I was that there is not a single reference to the Europe 2020 strategy. That means that a strategy which was adopted unanimously by the European Council has not even been mentioned by the Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">I am appealing to Parliament on this, because we now have a strategy and we must apply it, determinedly, to all these areas. That is what I was referring to when I talked of ownership of the strategy at all levels. However, in the reply I sent to the 12 Heads of State or Government, I also enclosed an annex outlining everything that is already being done by the European institutions; that is to say, not only by the European Council, but also by the Commission and the Council. It is clear from this document that some of the issues are being blocked by the very same governments that signed the letter.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One example is the European patent. We have been discussing the possibility of having a European patent for 30 years. Nonetheless, we now have governments which are calling for more to be done for growth, but are still blocking the European patent.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is why we need to be in agreement. Let us look at what people talk about when they speak of Europe. When it is said that Europe has some problems at the moment, which is true, we must look at which parties are doing their best to move European projects forward and which are sometimes blocking decisions at European level. I believe that this is a vital precondition for a debate that is not only politically but also intellectually honest.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The issue of Greece is one that demands such honesty. Greece is not in this situation because of the euro, because in truth, there are other countries outside the euro area which have also had need of assistance programmes. There are other countries even outside the European Union – the first that comes to mind is Iceland – which have had problems closely approaching a general crisis for the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The problem that we are experiencing today is chiefly due to two things: firstly, the unsustainable nature of many of our countries’ public debts and, secondly, and not necessarily in that order, irresponsible financial conduct in many spheres, particularly outside Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We now have a response, therefore, which is undoubtedly more difficult in terms of structure because of the euro, since we are a monetary union which has not yet fully established all the instruments of economic union and we are in the midst of giving an urgent response to the challenge. It is, however, intellectually and politically mistaken to say that the current crisis is a result of the euro. Quite the reverse: the euro may be the solution to the current crisis.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, to be honest, I cannot accept the words of some people who say here that they truly share Greece’s suffering, and that they regret all the difficulties that it is going through. Their government has not, however, spent a single euro, or a single pound to help Greece.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">That is not the kind of solidarity we need. Look at what they are proposing as a solution for Greece: default. Default is apparently the solution. I would really like someone to explain to me why the default of a European Union Member State could be the solution. What kind of confidence could there be in that country in terms of investment? How could deadlock throughout that country, the paralysis of its public services, the inability to pay public officials and the closure of hospitals and schools be a solution for the country? Come on, we have to be serious here. Suggesting default as a solution for Greece is truly an instance of political and intellectual dishonesty such as I have rarely seen before.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="fr">There are also some people who say that this programme for Greece is not going to work, that it is an invention of the Troika. Well, let us be clear on this subject as well. The programme for Greece is the programme that was unanimously adopted by the Member States of the euro area. The so-called Troika, namely, the Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, has acted within the framework of the mandate it received, in line with the aid that was available. That is the question.</p>
      <p sl="fr">So now, all those who wish to help Greece – which approved the programme, not just through its government, but also through its parliament, with the two main parties – instead of starting to say that it will never work, I really think they would do better to help us to help Greece. Granted, it is extremely difficult; granted, there are enormous costs; granted, we will have to see how we can help Greece to bear certain social costs which, in the short term, are immense. The truth is, though, that there is no other real solution than to promote structural reform so that Greece can regain the competitiveness it really needs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another question was on equity and standards, and was raised just now by my friend, Mr Saryusz-Wolski. Here, the response must be absolutely clear. The Commission will do all it can to apply all the treaties in an absolutely equitable way, without any discrimination. The example you mentioned of Hungary and Spain, frankly, does not make sense, because there is a vital difference: Hungary was due to achieve its aim of reducing the deficit in 2011; Spain must do so by 2013. We have proposed certain measures to Hungary, but they are not the only ones. There were five countries to which we made proposals: Poland, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium and Hungary. All but Hungary accepted them. It was not a case of special treatment for Hungary; it was Hungary that did not wish to adopt the proposals made by the Commission, in contrast to Poland, Cyprus, Malta and Belgium, namely, both countries which are in the euro area and countries which are not.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I tell you this quite openly because it would be a mistake now to create artificial divides between the countries in the euro area and those outside it. The Commission has always supported the integrity of the European Union and we are not going to have two different standards depending on the position of each of our countries.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as well as very interesting and very useful aspects to the debate, I have nonetheless noted several points on which there was consensus, at least among the largest political groupings. Firstly, we need to do more to combat youth unemployment, using the action teams that we have created. We must combat tax evasion. I would like to remind the Members of this Parliament that the Commission has not just made statements, but it has already made some proposals. Our initiative is called the ‘Savings Directive’, and we have also put forward a mandate for negotiation with third countries. The proposal has been before the Council for many months, but is blocked by two Member States. As you know, unanimity is required. Therefore, if you want to criticise someone, do not criticise the Commission; instead, help us to remove the obstacles posed by two of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="fr">With regard to Greece, I can tell you that it was one of the subjects of my conversation with Prime Minister Papademos and six other members of my Commission. I called upon them to ensure – even before a comprehensive agreement by the European Union with Switzerland, and with other countries – that Greece enters into a bilateral agreement with Switzerland, which complies, of course, with EU law. Not only did I mention this to the Greek prime minister, but I had already mentioned it to the previous President of the Swiss Confederation, on the last occasion.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Another aspect of the consensus I have seen here relates to the need to bring the single internal market to completion. I have already announced that some time in the autumn, the Commission will put forward the Single Market Act, and you can count on us to do that. There is also agreement on the need to match our action with investment. That is why we have tabled this before the European Council. It was favourably received, but now we must actually find the legislative text, the project bonds, to make some investment by anticipating now what we hope to have in due course in the financial framework, and because we are in agreement on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The question is whether we have the resources for this investment. The truth is that in most of our Member States, we do not have any budgetary margin for much public investment. That is why we need – and I think that on this point the major political groupings are in agreement – to work together to obtain certain resources for a European investment, either through performance bonds, or project bonds, or the future financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that Parliament will work with the Commission to ensure that our results match our ambitions. It will be necessary, too, to use all the growth levers, such as innovation and research, and also our European instruments, but that will demand a lot of work and a lot of determination. I truly believe that in order to achieve growth in Europe, we do not need more announcements of growth. What we need is not more announcements but commitment in implementation and execution and determination. This is how we will be able to fulfil the commitments and promises that we have made, and by ‘we’ I mean all the institutions and also each of our Member States.</p>

    <intervention id="2-059-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Herman Van Rompuy" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">European Council. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first to thank all those who have congratulated me on my re-election. I saw that enthusiasm varied across the House, but, as I always say: ‘no one is obliged to be enthusiastic’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There have been many criticisms of the overall approach, but our general strategy, which we have adopted both at EU and Member State level, is a strategy that has been supported by all the Member States, by all the Prime Ministers and Heads of State since the start of the crisis, two and a half years ago. That includes those who have since left the Council, because of those who elected me two and a half years ago, only 12 remain.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The current composition of the European Council supports this strategy. At the last Council meeting too, all 27 countries signed the treaty on what is called the fiscal compact. One may criticise the overall approach, but I would simply say that, over the last two and a half years, this strategy has been the European Council’s unanimous strategy. Of course, everyone is aware that this is a difficult and unpopular road and that it will only produce results in the medium term or even, in some cases, in the long term. That is, however, the road that we have chosen and we will keep to it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">During my introductory speech, I said, extremely prudently:</p>
      <p sl="fr">Our strategy is going to work. We have reached a turning point’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Normally, I am very prudent. In this case too, I have also been very prudent. I was translated as having said that it was the end of the crisis, etc. That was not the case at all. Fear not, I said that it was the turning point in a very serious crisis. In the press, which is totally opposed to the European project and the euro project, there is no more talk of the end of the euro area. The fact that there is no more talk of this nature is quite significant. Of course, not all the problems have been resolved. When I see that the interbank market is recovering after months of inertia, that there is a significant drop in interest rates in several countries that had been under pressure, we can say, in fact, that we have reached the bottom of the trough. However, there is still a long way to go.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The most guaranteed way to have positive economic growth like that of 2010 and 2011, and which we do not have in 2012, is, of course, to re-establish confidence in the future of the euro area. This is the top precondition for growth. What is missing in several countries now is this confidence on the part of consumers and investors in the future of the euro area. With the signs that growth in the euro is returning, consumers and investors may follow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are told that structural reform is needed. I was under the impression that this was a reference to structural reform in the Member States. In fact, it is a reference to firewalls and other initiatives in the financial sphere. However, what is being forgotten is that outside the firewalls, on which, I believe, decisions will be taken in the coming weeks, what really lasts – and, of course, there has been too little discussion of this – is structural reforms in the employment market and the goods market. What we need is to restore competitiveness simultaneously to the Member States and the EU in general. Otherwise, this crisis will return at some stage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What has truly astonished me here is that the term ‘European Semester’ has not been said once. Some have made a very slight allusion to it. The European Council’s aim was, in fact, to evaluate the European Semester, to see what progress we have made on it, in budgetary, macro-economic and employment terms. The Member States are being asked to introduce their reform plans and stability plans during the next few weeks. In May, recommendations will be given, through the Commission. At the Council meeting in June, the matter will be discussed again. If the European Semester is not taken seriously, the crisis will happen again at some stage. I am disappointed to have heard no mention, or very little, of this essential project, which was approved by the European Parliament and adopted very enthusiastically at the time. The major challenge during a period of inevitable fiscal consolidation, in almost all the countries, is to maintain long-term policies. The President of the Commission rightly pointed to the Europe 2020 strategy, and the whole art of fiscal consolidation is to establish priorities, to consolidate and, in general, to reduce deficits and debt levels while protecting the future, while preserving a certain type of spending within research and development, education, youth training, and investment, particularly on climate change. Establishing the priorities within fiscal consolidation work: that is the great challenge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Of course, in addition to that, there is equity. That is why the banks have been asked for a huge contribution. They are losing 70% of the current value of the Greek debt in contributions to the Greek recovery. I agree with all those who have argued for even stronger measures against fraud and tax evasion. The Commission has just set out the measures it has taken. Of course, there is the unanimity rule with regard to taxation, but many things can be achieved at national level. We do not always need a European framework. The problem in Greece is that of collecting taxes. That is the greatest injustice and the very source of its huge public deficit. In the midst of the fiscal consolidation policy, solidarity must, of course, be maintained. That is why, at European Union level, we have granted aid to Greece which is equivalent to 100% of Greek GDP. If even more solid proof is required of the European Union’s solidarity towards countries in difficulty, the figure speaks volumes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We must, in the midst of the fiscal consolidation policy, keep our sights on climate objectives. Two are on track. We need to work more on another, relating to energy efficiency. We are calling once again on the Member States, in addition to fiscal consolidation, to implement a specific employment policy. That is why we are looking forward to their plans for employment, due in April. We will evaluate them and that will be included within the recommendations we make in relation to the Member States in June.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We need a special policy for Greece, and we are working on it. The Greek Prime Minister is fully committed to this path. Going further with the single market does not cost anything in budget terms. Another issue is the letter from the 12 governments. I do not agree with those who have said that the letter has not been taken into account. Quite the reverse: in fact, after a careful reading of the final draft conclusion, dealing with issues including the single market, which I submitted to the European Council, there was scarcely any debate. This was because the elements in the letter which enjoyed a consensus had already been taken into account to a great extent.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Do we need to go further still with a recovery policy? I have heard words to that effect. However, the days when we used to create a recovery policy through public expenditure, as in the past, are now over. A much more subtle and sophisticated approach is needed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We cannot avoid a budgetary consolidation policy, but within this policy we must, as I have said, keep our sights set on some expenditure that generates growth and jobs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">A final word about Syria and Bosnia. As far as Syria is concerned, we can go much further, under one condition: that we get a mandate from the Security Council of the United Nations. It is not Europe, not European countries, that are standing in the way, but two countries that have also been specifically named in the decisions of the European Council that are preventing us from taking much more decisive action in relation to Syria. It is not our call.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And if we want to go further on the humanitarian front, as well, and if we want to protect people who are providing on-the-spot humanitarian aid, we need to get a mandate from the United Nations. We had that mandate for Libya and we made full use of it – albeit in different circumstances and for different purposes – but we have no mandate for Syria.</p>
      <p sl="nl">As for Bosnia, I have had a very interesting meeting with the new Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina who showed that the new BiH Government has a new, fundamentally European, orientation. The European institutions, the European Union, are prepared to respond to that as soon as possible, in such a way that this country, too, will be able to maintain its European prospects. This is the first evidence of a genuine European will in that country, which played such a tragic role in a civil war on the very borders of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me just briefly say that I am glad that the Council again underlined the fact that sustainable growth and jobs cannot be built on deficit and excessive debt levels. That was a good statement; something that we have been working on through the ‘six-pack’ and I was also glad to hear that Mr van Rompuy referred to the ‘six-pack’ because it has actually worked. Four countries have actually taken some very important corrective action thanks to the ‘six-pack’, though it is unfortunate that Hungary has not been able to do so.</p>
      <p sl="en">Considering the ‘two-pack’ negotiations which are ongoing, I guess it would be really good if the Council would this time endorse the fact that we need more automaticity in order to have a credible ‘two-pack’ result. In the ‘six-pack’ negotiations, the Council was against this approach; we were persistent and the outcome was very good.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mr Verhofstadt has already spoken about the Redemption Fund. I only want to say that I am sure that if we do not do this, we are going to keep beefing up the so-called rescue mechanisms to the bitter end, due to market pressure.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the 2020 strategy, I tend to share the slightly cynical approach taken by Mr Barroso earlier. We have to remember that despite all these good promises and decisions – for instance in the latest Council meeting – the same Council wanted to cut EUR 560 million from research and innovation in the budget of 2012. Luckily, the Parliament was able to stop this, but this just proves again that the Council does not live up to its own goals and decisions and you have much work to do in the Council.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my third speech in the House so far this year on this issue and I am sorry to stick to the same refrain but, as my fellow countryman, Miguel de Unamuno, used to say: ‘to strike the nail once, you must strike the horseshoe a hundred times’. Furthermore, I want to repeat the call to actively implement the measures that have been agreed in the last few Councils.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the President of the Commission has said, we need to finish the job. We need growth, ladies and gentlemen. With austerity, we will manage to create stability and confidence, but we also have to emerge from the crisis and create work and well-being once more.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need to commit to urgent implementation of the measures that were agreed upon in the last few Councils to incentivise growth. These measures must be accompanied by reforms. Spain is clearly committed to this spirit of reform. In less than 100 days, we have passed three key reforms: budgetary stability, financial reform and labour reform and this spirit of reform does not end here.</p>
      <p sl="es">As Mariano Rajoy says, the Spanish Government not only announces reforms, it carries them out, which is a different thing altogether. Let us follow its example. Let us not announce plans for growth, let us implement them. Furthermore, we need a degree of adaptability to circumstances given that we live in a world of constant change and evolution.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the President of the government of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, said recently before the House and as the Economy Minister, Luis de Guindos confirmed today, Spain is fulfilling its duties and will continue to do so. Spain is more committed than ever to Europe. It has demonstrated this right from the start, putting its cards on the table and standing by its desire to comply with what has been agreed.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the reality of economic development. The Italian economy began to grow at the beginning of the year and in Spain, the signs of growth are even clearer. The situation in Portugal is no better. There are even problems in the Netherlands and industrial order books are shrinking in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Barroso said before he left that we had had a useful discussion this morning. I am currently trying to work out what he meant by that. Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy said ‘growth and employment’ around 10 to 15 times this morning, it is true. Has that changed anything or will it change anything? No!</p>
      <p sl="de">Repeating empty phrases will not result in any changes taking place. Therefore, I would like to know what is new about the way in which the European Council, the Member States and the Commission are dealing with the problem. Mr Barroso gave us one hint when he said that structural reforms must also involve social cohesion. It would be good if you could explain what you mean by that, because we have been arguing about it for quite some time. What do you mean by this? Do you agree with the idea proposed by Mr Swoboda and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament that all young people must have prospects for the future, but it is just a question of how we ensure this is the case? Do you want minimum wages in all European Member States which adapt dynamically to productivity and growth? Is that what you want?</p>
      <p sl="de">Then you say that growth is essential. Until now, your services have always denied that this had anything to do with investment, because you said that this only concerned structural reforms. This is why the memorandum of understanding in each individual case relating to this issue is so modest. Where is the investment channel that we argued about during the discussions on the ‘six-pack’? If you have nothing to say about investments, then you also have nothing to say about growth. The time for empty phrases has passed. We are waiting for an answer.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the decision of the European Council to endorse Serbia’s candidacy has a two-fold significance. With respect to Serbia, it marks the definitive end to the aftermath of the Wars of the Yugoslav Succession, and the lingering assumption widely held at the time that the Serbs were somehow the hereditary villains of the Balkans. With the acceptance of Serbia’s candidacy, that particular canard has been laid to rest. Serbia can now be regarded as having returned to the European family and this has its long-term significance. After all, stability in south-eastern Europe is inconceivable without Serbia – and stability here has to extend to all policy areas, notably crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Without Serbia’s full commitment in the fight against organised crime, the Balkans would continue to constitute an easy prey for transnational mafias. But the step has a second, possibly greater significance. It makes it clear that EU enlargement, though moving forward only slowly, has not stalled. This obviously has implications for the rest of south-eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is equally noteworthy is that, despite the economic crisis, the EU continues its commitment to enhancing the stability of its neighbourhood, relying on soft power to achieve this. The encouragement of the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the planned elaboration of a road map are evidently steps in the direction of ensuring that objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">All these strategies and policy objectives, however, depend on overcoming the long drawn-out economic crisis, the central concern of the summit. Here, the decisions point in the right direction and it is absolutely crucial that fiscal discipline goes hand in hand with the recognition of the importance of economic growth. In the absence of this, the EU will find itself much less attractive and with much reduced soft power.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, President Barroso has just said that there is no growth without stability and confidence, but that is a truism. He should also know that there is no stability and confidence without growth and a dynamic economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">The problem which we can now identify in the actions of the Commission and the Council is that the measures taken for tackling the economic problems are of a different order. They are biased. On one side, we have fiscal measures that are entering into the legislation and that bring severe penalties as a consequence. On the other side – on the side of growth – we have words and nice declarations without budgetary support. The result is very clear. I had the chance to see it with my two socialist colleagues, Robert Goebbels and Elisa Ferreira in Greece: a freefall of the Greek economy and the inability to service the debt. These are the consequences of the European policy that Mr Barroso asks us to support. What is the solution? The solution is a structural change, a partial mutualisation of debt among powerful European budgets, based on own resources and project bonds.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I would like to say in this House how pleased I am with the contribution that the European Council and European Commission have made to the calmer situation that prevails today concerning the issue of Member States with excessive debts. However, I must also state how disappointed I am because, even after this European Council meeting, Romania and Bulgaria are still outside the Schengen area, even though they have fulfilled all the conditions required by this agreement to be admitted into the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is no coincidence that there is one Member State which opposes the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area. I use the phrase ‘no coincidence’ because in this Member State, the Netherlands, a small party which is in government has come up with the initiative to launch a website which is insulting to European values and insulting to the free movement of persons in the European Union. Unfortunately, the response from the European Commission and the European Council has been very ineffectual so far. I do not believe that we can tolerate such initiatives in any Member State, targeted against European values, and I hope that this afternoon, the European Parliament will adopt a firm stance by condemning such initiatives.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, firstly, allow me to say that I consider it encouraging that we now all acknowledge that focusing solely on fiscal restructuring measures will not get Greece out of the crisis or Europe out of stagnation. It is encouraging, but it is not enough.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need binding decisions and projects, because words and wishes do not suffice. If we want to be specific and convincing towards the citizens of Europe, then we can and must link specific development measures, such as a financial transaction tax and Eurobonds, with the new fiscal compact.</p>
      <p sl="el">Allow me, however, to address the various ‘Pythias’ inside and outside this Chamber talking about Greece leaving the euro for the sake of democracy and the prosperity of the Greek people. Clearly, everyone may have their own opinion, but democracy in this Parliament is non-negotiable.</p>
      <p sl="el">For heaven’s sake, do not cite the interest of the Greek people.

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to ask for your attention, basically so as to welcome the results of the Council. This is not because the measures are ideal, but because they are possible. There is no doubt that we have now gone much further and we can be more optimistic than we were three months ago or six months ago. Many Member States have been making enormous efforts to stabilise and consolidate their public finances, and these efforts have only been made in some of them at the European Union’s behest. These efforts are crucial if they are to be able to recover their credibility on the international markets and crucial if they are, in time, to be able to return to growth.</p>
      <p sl="pt">With these guarantees that the Member States – in particular, Portugal – have been giving on fiscal consolidation, or budgetary consolidation, I am convinced that, with the new treaty signed between the 25, we will be in a position to relaunch growth in earnest with the European Council’s next steps. It is only with this trust that is being built up, little by little, that this growth can be created.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That is why I would say this: it is important for those who are richer to feel solidarity for those who are poorer, but the poor must also understand the other point of view, by giving these guarantees.</p>

As a Czech, I have to say that this is an error. The Czech Republic is located at the heart of Europe, not only geographically but also politically, and it is therefore in its vital, security, political and economic interests to take an active and full part in European integration, including, of course, monetary and fiscal integration. This is an opinion, it is the position of Czech social democrats, and it is also the opinion of the majority of Czech society, which, as you know, came out clearly in favour of European integration in a referendum. The fiscal compact is no panacea, of course. As my fellow Members have said, we want to see more jobs, more investment and more social policy here, but fiscal responsibility is the foundation.</p>

We all want less tension, but there are no easy, magic formulae. Decisions need to be taken both at European level and within the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">Structural changes will help, especially in countries such as mine. It is the only way to address its current crisis and generate hope for growth. The fiscal compact, the European Semester and decisions on increasing employment can, and must, guide us forward.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the fiscal compact signed a few days ago illustrates that growth and jobs continue to be glaringly ignored by Europe’s leaders. If small and medium-sized enterprises are key for growth and employment, and youth employment in particular, as President Barroso has stressed, is it not scandalous that – particularly in countries suffering bailout and recessive austerity, like mine – they are being choked by a lack of credit from banks that are going to the European Central Bank for liquidity at 1% but which, immorally, continue to refuse them finance or to grant it only in exchange for exorbitant interest rates?</p>
      <p sl="pt">How too, despite President Barroso having acknowledged here that more than EUR 1 trillion in investment is lost to the European economy from tax evasion, can the passiveness of our governments and the Commission in response to it be explained?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The fiscal compact does not include a single line on tax harmonisation, on controlling off-shore accounts, on combating fiscal dumping between the Member States or even on the financial transaction tax, which, as well as representing additional resources for investment, would be a start on controlling financial transactions in the European Union. Are we surprised that young Europeans are being obliged to leave the European Union? In Portugal, where the unemployment rate exceeds 35%, the government is accepting collective incapability and incompetence, and is encouraging them to emigrate. Are they not dying of shame?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it seems we have reached a turning point. The markets are calming down and confidence in the euro area appears to be being restored, as President Van Rompuy rightly said here. We are, thereby, fulfilling an important prerequisite for returning to the road of national economic growth and, also, for creating anew an investment climate that inspires confidence. Let us face it, companies are keeping a lot of their money in the bank. Private investors are currently afraid to invest but, as confidence is restored, that money will then be able to be invested to boost further economic growth. However, everything will depend on the question of whether or not we actually deliver cash on the nail.</p>
      <p sl="nl">President Van Rompuy spoke about our needing a growth strategy. However, we already have a Europe 2020 strategy. We must also start implementing it. And that will only work if we first search our own hearts. It does not help things much when the Commission points the finger at the Council, the Council at Parliament, and Parliament at the Member States. One excellent example of this which I have found is the excellent letter from the twelve Heads of Government, which points the finger at the European Commission and waxes lyrical about what the European Commission ought to start doing.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, if those Heads of Government themselves put some effort into preventing tax evasion for once, then it would be possible for the Europe 2020 strategy to be implemented with its own budget. That would mean sparing education from cuts, for example, while still promoting efficiency in the public sector. If we do what we have promised, then we will be able to extricate ourselves from the crisis.</p>

However, it is now completely obvious that without growth, the conditions of millions of people in Europe are set to get worse. Furthermore, the undervaluation of the social effects of the recession in all of our economies is, as I was saying, really surprising and worrying. Without investments and without this trend being reversed, we risk huge social problems over the coming months.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, if the problem of the European economy were that our public spending is too low and our deficits too small, we would have no problems at all. I want to say this in response to the debate here, as it sounds as if we could solve our problems by increasing public spending and increasing the deficits, thereby achieving social cohesion and economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have seen the contrary: that uncontrolled public spending and big deficits are undermining social security and hindering growth, and creating the austerity of increasing interest rates. That is the reality, and those who believe that increased public spending is the solution to our problems should just look around and take a look at our problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, what we need to do is to create a new way of stimulating the economy. I think it is important for the Commission to understand that the way to social cohesion and social security does not run parallel to the policy for economic growth. Economic growth and new jobs are the key issue in order to achieve social development in Europe that we can all be satisfied with. That is why I would like to urge the Commission to proceed with the reforms for the internal market, for competitiveness in the Member States, and for making the European Union the biggest market in the world.</p>

However, in order to achieve growth, we need a definite investment plan, we need to find the sources and identify them, along with the sectors offering the potential for growth and employment. Given that a huge number of citizens, especially young people and women, need jobs, we also need to create these jobs. There is just one problem I have with this: if there are sources available through the Savings Directive mentioned by Mr Barroso, why is this directive still being blocked inside the Council, and, if we are talking about growth, employment and social policies, why is the Maternity Leave Directive still being blocked by the Council?</p>

      <p sl="en">The biggest problem still seems to be the aftermath of the Council meetings. While following strict financial discipline, it is crucial that new investments should be made to build an efficient knowledge-based economy, to reduce administrative burdens for SMEs, and to boost youth employment. The key issue is to make decisive use of the basic instrument on which the European Community is based: the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today, President Barroso used the well-known politically correct term: deepening of the single market.

      <p sl="en">Now is the time finally to overcome hesitation and caution about fully implementing the single market.

Most importantly, our satisfaction should not stop us facing up to the enormous structural problem that the policies of recent months have not resolved.</p>
      <p sl="it">The strategy of salary deflation brought in by austerity policies as an alternative to devaluation is not economically or socially sustainable, nor is it universally accepted in political terms. We should leave the caricatures behind. Nobody here is proposing deficit spending. We do think, however, that it is possible to combine national fiscal responsibility with a revitalisation of investment and demand; it is possible with a more even distribution of wealth; it is possible if we confront macro-economic imbalances; it is possible through large-scale EU investment; it is possible if we set up shared management of debts through a debt redemption fund.</p>

I am calling on the Member States to accept this offer, so that the Commission and the European institutions are not in the position of being dependent, but instead have more freedom to act in the political arena and more credibility. We know that more funding will be available for the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). We must not postpone our decisions. We must make them now. Kosovo is not just a problem for Serbia. The five Member States of the EU which are refusing to recognise Kosovo must finally do so. We need more action and less criticism.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, the Council’s conclusions are aimed at both making savings and growth. However, with five and a half million young people unemployed, it is essential to encourage, educate and train young people to take risks, risks which are also related to entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p sl="sl">Everything may start with an idea, but the same idea without implementation, or without the courage to implement it, does not mean much.

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, this has been the first time for two years that the European Council was not occupied with putting out fires; however, the flames have not yet died down. Europe is not out of harm’s way just yet, because without economic growth, we will be unable to break free from our debt spiral. A wide range of topics were discussed, including the development of the internal market and the urgent introduction of Eurobonds; however, I am convinced that, in addition, we also need a comprehensive EU growth programme and an EU development package to promote job creation. On the other hand, we are faced with a fundamental structural problem as regards the functioning of the euro. It has become apparent that, as a common currency, the euro is incapable of handling the economies of countries at different levels of competitiveness. The economic difficulties of Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, and their being on the verge of state bankruptcy, are not just the fault of their respective governments but also an indication of the common failure of the euro. The euro must therefore undergo fundamental reform.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, on the subject of the Schengen issue, I think that the continued opposition shown by the Netherlands to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area is an abuse which runs counter to the European Union’s long-term principles and objectives. The stance adopted by the Netherlands has led to the postponement of the decision on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area. It has highlighted once again that, although all Member States have equal responsibilities, they do not all enjoy the same benefits.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Colleagues, the populist ambitions of some leaders and parties on the European political scene only serve to weaken the EU’s power and reduce the credibility of politicians at European level. Given that all the conditions for accession have been met, I take this opportunity to call for all responsible institutions to identify and implement all the necessary measures contributing to the enlargement of the Schengen area.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, on several occasions, I have taken part in the debate on the European Council conclusions in order to address aspects that have nothing to do with the governance of the euro area but rather with the fundamental truths and raison d’être of the EU, which is a community in law.</p>
      <p sl="es">I say this once again, in relation precisely to the conclusions relating to the area of freedom, security and justice, to free movement of persons and the enlargement of the Schengen area. In June, this Parliament approved the extension of the Schengen area to include Romania and Bulgaria which, in accordance with their accession treaties of 2005, had to fulfil certain requirements. The Council considered that Romania and Bulgaria fulfil those requirements but, yet again, has postponed its decision and referred it to a decision of the Justice and Home Affairs Council at a meeting that will take place in September 2012.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament can only hope that that meeting actually gives rise to the fulfilment of an undertaking with Romania and Bulgaria, which have met their criteria for gaining access to the Schengen area, and that the EU works to strengthen the Schengen area. Naturally, the statements that we have heard in the French election campaign do not contribute in that direction, statements which threaten the re-establishment of internal borders within the EU and contribute to mistrust and ill feeling among Europeans, the opposite way from the way we should be going.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Treaty on Fiscal Discipline is not concerned with the well-being of its signatories, but with the well-being of the euro and, of course, the project. This so-called ‘treaty’ seeks to impose a fiscal and monetary straitjacket that takes away the sovereignty of voters in Member States and the eurozone. It addresses the problem of sovereign debt, but with inflexible diktats, rather than with practical solutions. Its cure for economic undernourishment is to put the countries of the south on a starvation diet of economic austerity that is reducing incomes and raising unemployment and will make balancing the budget even more difficult. With an overvalued currency, employment is the only thing they can export.</p>
      <p sl="en">The ailing economies of the south need to leave the eurozone, revert to their own currencies and devalue. That will enable them to enjoy export-led expansion. They also need to reflate their economies by government-directed investment financed by quantitative easing and not borrowing. This would not, of course, be possible within the eurozone.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I know that many of the questions have already been answered by our President so, if you will allow me, I will just focus on the issues which have been most frequently mentioned by the honourable Members, particularly jobs, growth and where to find investment in order to support policies in both these areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">But first, I would like to assure the honourable Members of this House that unemployment, and especially youth unemployment, is one of the five key priorities on which we would like the whole European Union to focus this year. This was the conclusion of the Annual Growth Survey. This is one of the priorities for the European Semester where we, of course, would expect this priority to feature very highly in the national reform programmes of each and every Member State because we are fully aware of how painful this is for our citizens and how difficult it is for our economies not to have enough high-quality jobs.</p>
      <p sl="en">What the Commission will do further is that already in April, we will be putting forward an employment policy package. We are doing our best to help the EU as such and our Member States to improve the functioning of the labour market and to create better conditions for the creation of jobs. We would like to focus on the possibilities across the whole economy, but we would also like to be even more concentrated in the areas and sectors where we see a big potential for the new jobs, such as health care, white sector, information, communications technologies and the ICT sector as such.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also going to tackle the problems and the obstacles which still hamper the free movement of labour and labour mobility within the European Union. In particular, we would like to assist the young people who are witnessing unprecedented pressure on the labour market. We are absolutely convinced that we cannot afford to have 7.5 million young people who are not employed and not in education or in training. We therefore deployed eight action teams from the Commission which have already come back from the Member States with concrete ideas. We are going to implement them together with the Member States and the social partners in these countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course we support youth job guarantees. We would like every young European to have a chance to get – within a very short period of time after completing his or her studies – either a job or to have the possibility of continuing their education or, if there is not a particular job available, to work towards requalification or get into retraining so we can use the potential of our young generation in the European Union. To do that, we are also going to improve the tools which would help young people to seek jobs. We are going to improve and introduce the new scheme, ‘Your first EURES job’, which should help young people in finding opportunities on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Then, of course, the question is where to find the investment and where to find the money to be invested in the economy, especially in this time of austerity where budget consolidation is a very clear priority. We would not like to repeat the dramatic events we have gone through in the last two years. With regard to the creation of new jobs and employment, we believe that we still can do much better with the money which is available from EU funds. To date, we have EUR 22 billion in the European Social Fund and EUR 62 billion in the Structural and Cohesion Funds which have not yet been spent. We want to help the Member States to have another look at spending priorities – how they can reprogramme them and use them for the active labour policy so we can create new jobs, for young people in particular, but, of course, for every European.</p>
      <p sl="en">Several ideas have been mentioned as to where we can generate more income and more investments. I think that we have complete agreement on them because the Commission is very much in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax. It was a proposal which we made and we are working very hard with the Member States to convince them because, as you know, we need unanimity on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are advancing our work on project bonds because our simulations show very promising results. We can actually use EUR 230 million from the EU budget and leverage it, together with the EIB, to EUR 700 million. This would end up, raising the money on the private market, with the sum of EUR 3.5 billion. This is money we can spend on infrastructure, on ICT and on projects which generate a lot of employment and which improve the overall competitiveness of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">You know that we support own resources and we make this point at every single negotiation meeting which takes place with Member States. You know – because you are getting the information from your negotiators – that this discussion is difficult but we are truly convinced that, if we want to have a more transparent budget and less drama when we are negotiating multiannual financial frameworks (MFF), we need solid own resources for the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would say one more thing even. I think that, if we look at investment policy, one of the best investment tools we have in the EU is the EU budget. Where in the world would you find a budget where 94% of the budget goes back to the Member States with the high value-added proposals supporting the programmes and the policies which are actually increasing competitiveness and cohesion among the Member States? This is how we have to look at the EU budget and this is what I am sometimes missing when we are discussing the EU budget and the MFF with Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thank you very much for your support for the Single Market Act and for your willingness to consider the possibility of fast-tracking some of our proposals, because we believe that by unlocking the single market potential, we can create a lot of new jobs and, indeed, new growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, regarding Romania and Bulgaria and Schengen, you know very well that the Commission’s position is very clear. We are convinced that Bulgaria and Romania have fulfilled all the conditions necessary to join Schengen and we believe that both countries should already be members of Schengen.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I agree with my colleagues who said previously that, at the European Council meeting, we missed an opportunity for a detailed discussion and specific agreements on increasing the social aspect in all areas of EU policy, particularly growth of the Member States’ economies. I believe that fiscal consolidation, greater coordination of the Member States’ economies and tighter financial discipline are essential measures for ensuring that we can properly rebalance our economies and steer them in the right direction. However, looking at the current state of the EU, it is becoming quite clear that budgetary discipline and severe austerity measures on their own will not enable us to achieve the economic growth expected. Today in Europe, unemployment among people of working age is increasing massively, the situation with regard to youth unemployment is particularly bad, business enterprises, especially small and medium-sized, are facing difficult times and all of this only delays the economic recovery of individual Member States and the EU as a whole. In 2012, the European Council endorsed the five important priorities for growth in employment and much greater efforts will be required to achieve these. I believe that it is very important for the Member States to establish specific and measurable commitments in their national reform programmes and the Commission should monitor the implementation of these commitments more closely.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The last European Council was marked by the signing of the so-called ‘fiscal compact’, now renamed the ‘International Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union’, despite its being in breach of the European Union’s own rules. The rules provided for in this ‘treaty’ represent the institutionalisation of the same policies that led to the tragic social situation that we are currently experiencing, with a dizzying increase in unemployment, reduced wages – and, therefore, increased exploitation – and the dismantling of the social functions of the state. In truth, these are not new political and ideological guidelines. What we do have before us is the implementation of the old guidelines, which have been behind Europe’s entire process of capitalist integration, with toughened-up content and better means for making them work. Behind the technocratic language and words about ‘budgetary consolidation’ is hidden the reality of condemning thousands of families to poverty and despair. The only result of the path that this Council meeting has set out again is the deepening of the economic crisis in the EU Member States – which is clearly the situation, as established by the European Commission’s own figures, which confirm the economic recession in the euro area – and further deterioration of the social crisis that the unemployment figures published yesterday eloquently illustrate.</p>

      <p sl="hu">At the last summit, the majority of Member States signed the budgetary pact intended to ensure the stability and an even closer coordination of the economic and monetary union. This not only marks the conclusion of another intergovernmental agreement but also the end of an immensely long process to which the European Parliament contributed with exceptional support and expertise. However, it is essential that besides common economic policy regulation, which definitely provides a clear background for Member State budgetary policies, the European Union should, in future, evaluate Member State efforts towards common economic governance in a transparent manner, using quantitative criteria laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact. The Council conclusions, too, state that budgetary consolidation must be implemented in light of the Member States’ specific circumstances, but in a differentiated manner. It is therefore unacceptable for the performance of certain Member States to be unjustly evaluated on the basis of subjective criteria, while failing to recognise that in the medium and long term, the focus of economic policy trends in the Member State in question has always been to avoid austerity measures and to pursue commonly established goals, that is, reduce the budget deficit and gradually curb sovereign debt. If we operate the economic policy system that we have successfully established in an irresponsible manner by unduly discriminating between Member States and continuously inciting tensions, we jeopardise the credibility of the entire European institutional system and the sustainability of common economic governance.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am particularly worried after the signature of the fiscal compact during the last European Council. We, Socialists and Democrats, have been defending from the start balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility, but this cannot be the only reaction to the dreadful crisis Europe is facing. While we witness every day the dramatic social consequences of measures focused exclusively on austerity, we urgently need concrete measures to restore growth and tackle unemployment. I would like to emphasise the issue of youth unemployment, which is now reaching an average rate of more than 22% in Europe. This is unacceptable. That is why the Party of European Socialists, with the support of the S&amp;D Group, has launched a campaign to tackle youth unemployment, calling for binding measures and sufficient financial support to ensure the access of young people to quality jobs. Therefore, I strongly hope that the Commission and the Member States will take into consideration our demand to introduce a Youth Guarantee that would prevent any young European from being without a job or training for more than four months. How can we prepare the future of Europe if we do not do everything we can to ensure a decent future for our children?</p>

      <p sl="pl">The last European Council meeting apparently ended in success. Despite the opposition of two Member States, the Council succeeded in signing the fiscal compact, which is to be an important element of the economic stability of European countries. The fiscal compact is very often criticised as a solution which is not only overdue, but also insufficient. Even though the provisions of the agreement are not perfect, it has allowed continued stabilisation of markets and calmed the mood among investors. The principal task facing us today is the implementation of the compact’s provisions and compliance with the principle of community which we defend so vigorously. In addition, it is important how the provisions of Article 12 are implemented or, in other words, whether the voice of signatory countries outside the euro area will, in fact, be heard during Euro Group summits. I would also give a cautious welcome to the decision by members of the euro area to mobilise part of the funding from the second Greek aid package for ongoing expenditure and to launch a process to reduce the Greek debt. Unfortunately, it is a big problem that many measures taken to salvage the Greek economy do not have the support of most of society. We must not forget that prudential measures alone are insufficient and, sooner or later, Greece will have to focus on investments to stimulate growth and employment.</p>

      <p sl="lv">I welcome the intergovernmental agreement on fiscal discipline concluded by 25 of the European Union’s Member States. In the long term, this agreement can stabilise European monetary union and strengthen economic governance. I hope that the Member States participating in the agreement will, as soon as possible, ratify it and implement it in formulating their budgets. Only in this way will we be able to restore the confidence of the international financial markets in the European Union and secure the preconditions for economic growth and new jobs. The agreement complements the Stability and Growth Pact, the ‘six-pack’ of EU economic governance adopted last year, which includes five regulations and one directive, and the recently concluded agreement on the establishment of a European Stability Mechanism. Together with the upcoming ‘two-pack’, namely, the regulations which will lay down monitoring of the formulation of the euro area Member States’ budgets, this will really strengthen economic governance in Europe.</p>

The introduction of temporary border controls by Denmark and France, the intention of the Netherlands to install cameras at its borders, the discussions on the legal basis for the regulation on the Schengen evaluation and the recent statements made by France are exerting unjustified pressure on one of the EU’s most positive achievements: the free movement of persons.

      <p sl="de">With regard to the strategy for the southern neighbourhood, it is naïve to believe that democracies based on the European model will emerge in North Africa. The overwhelming victory of Islamist parties in the elections in Egypt and Tunisia shows that these countries, and probably Libya too, see their future not in the European Convention on Human Rights, but in Sharia law. Instead of considering putting additional burdens on the EU Member States in the form of North African debt relief, we must link EU subsidies to increased protection for religious minorities and mandatory repatriation of illegal immigrants. The EU itself does not always take democracy entirely seriously. For example, in democratic terms, it is right that the Irish people will have the opportunity to vote on the EU fiscal compact, but Brussels will not accept a ‘no’ vote. The signing of the so-called fiscal compact is another step towards a centralist federal European state. In the current crisis, Europe does not need a financial governing council in Brussels to supervise the euro countries. A total reform of the poorly designed monetary union would be much more useful. If restoring normal lending conditions is the objective, then the Basel III requirements must definitely be considered. Most importantly, we also need to put in place a framework for organised state bankruptcy in Greece, instead of wasting billions on useless rescue packages and risking years of stagnation in the euro area as a result.</p>

That time, however, might instead bring more xenophobia and more protectionism, as the electoral campaign in France is clearly demonstrating. My colleague, Hannes Swoboda, has asked a rhetorical question: what if we all had to show our passport once again to enter France? Well, as a Romanian MEP, I have to do this every time I come to Strasbourg, and not just to board a plane, as my colleague Mr Gollnisch pointed out, but to be allowed to enter the country which is making me attend the part-sessions here, in Strasbourg, instead of Brussels. And, on top of that, sometimes I have to subject myself to a search without a warrant instead of a normal airport check, and this only because my country is kept out of Schengen arbitrarily.

The reality is that other Member States are also behind this opposition, with their leaders caught up in nationalist, populist rhetoric. Against the background of the global economic crisis, the threat of Europe’s renationalisation is looming. Sacrificing the free movement of persons on the pretext that this would safeguard the security and cultural purity of Europe’s nations reflects the eurosceptic trend currently doing the rounds in the electoral campaign in France. While the French rejected the Constitutional Treaty by means of a referendum focused on debating national issues, the current presidential elections are raising controversy over European issues. This would be welcome if the tone adopted were not anti-European. Mr Hollande is speaking out against European economic governance initiated through the fiscal pact. Mr Sarkozy is calling for ‘political governance’ of the Schengen area. A ‘powerful France’ ought to define the principles of this governance, allowing ‘legitimate’ governments, unlike the European Commission, to impose sanctions on states which are not robust enough in tackling illegal immigration. The real problem is not how to defend the EU’s external borders, but the inconsistency of the EU’s migration policy. There is also the need to come up with an EU solution for guaranteeing the application of the principle of solidarity and frank cooperation between EU Member States, which is enshrined in the treaties but which has become a dead letter.</p>

      <p sl="pl">What basic conclusion can be drawn from the long struggle with the crisis and the attempts to achieve economic growth and increase employment? The measures which are taken, although relevant and moving in the right direction, are always overdue and lack sufficient depth. Overcoming the crisis will be possible only through structural reforms implemented comprehensively and quickly, with, of course, adequate preparation. It is, however, difficult to combat a crisis and introduce serious reforms when the politicians in power are guided principally by the interests of their own parties in the upcoming election campaigns.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We devote too much time to the issues of division of authority and separation of powers in the euro area when, in reality, the real issue at stake is maintaining the dominance of some EU Member States and protecting the interests of those countries and their banks. Economic policy coordination was possible under the previous legislation, for example, as per the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, but there was a lack of political will and the corresponding determination. The ‘six-pack’ that has been adopted must, in order to be fully effective, be strengthened by means of the ‘two-pack’. What steps need to be taken next? Is the fiscal compact sufficient?</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Council approved the five priorities for 2012, identified in the Annual Growth Survey conducted by the Commission: pursuing differentiated and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, restoring normal lending to the economy, promoting growth and competitiveness, tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis, and modernising public administration. However, I think that additional efforts are required at EU level to achieve the single market and, in particular, to complete the digital single market by 2015. I should stress the important contribution made by industry to economic growth, competitiveness, exports and job creation in Europe, boosting productivity and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the European Council’s decision to grant Serbia candidate country status. Given that the European Commission has acknowledged on several occasions that Romania and Bulgaria have fulfilled the technical criteria for joining the Schengen area, I call on the Council to adopt a decision to this effect as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="bg">The decision made by the European Council to grant Serbia the status of an EU candidate country is deserved recognition for the reforms which have been carried out in that country. The Serbian authorities staunchly support its European path and are fulfilling their commitments and promises, in spite of the difficult political and economic situation.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This decision confirms the attention which the EU is focusing on continuing the enlargement process, in spite of the economic problems, debt crisis and pressure on the single currency. Set in the context of the progress being made by the majority of countries in the region along the path towards EU integration, this gesture towards Serbia proves the EU’s lasting commitment to the Western Balkans, assumed in 2003.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Granting candidate country status is also a timely and clear sign of support for the pro-European political forces in Serbia, especially in view of the forthcoming parliamentary elections in early May and the real danger of an upsurge from nationalist and populist parties which could again cast doubt over the country’s European perspective.</p>
      <p sl="bg">The next and perhaps most important test for Serbia will be the start of membership negotiations, which will virtually make its integration into the EU irreversible. The path is clear, but there is still a great deal of work ahead in terms of fulfilling the agreements that have been reached, continuing the reforms and increasing regional cooperation. The Serbian people can count on the support of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Council on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund crisis derogation by Ms Berès and Ms Harkin, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (O-000014/2012 - B7-0102/2012).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Wammen, I address this question to you because Parliament does not understand what is happening at the Council.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In December, we adopted by a very large majority the Commission’s proposal to extend European Globalisation Adjustment Fund crisis measures. Now we see it has been completely blocked at the Council in an inconsistent move that we do not understand – for can we declare the crisis over? Can we really say that this fund has not been a useful reflection of the effects of this crisis on workers?</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, growth forecasts for European GDP are between 0.5% and 3%. Or is Mr Draghi mistaken when he cites these figures for future European growth? The Commission itself predicted an economic downturn of 0.3% across the European Union in its latest projections published in February, despite the fact that in November 2011, it was still expecting 0.5% growth in 2012. Where will the crisis end?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The crisis facing those employed in industry threatens the very existence of European sentiment. It encourages scepticism towards the European Union. It causes us to turn our backs on the very essence of our peaceful coexistence and ignores the elements of social justice we could provide. Applications submitted under crisis-related criteria have only increased since this crisis has not gone away.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I must tell you Mr President that within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have had the opportunity to hear from Spanish and Lithuanian experts who told us how valuable this crisis mechanism was. Furthermore, I wish to bear witness here to the response of the German public authorities. The director of the European Social Fund group has testified to the exemplary nature of this mechanism in bringing about social innovation and enabling workers affected by this crisis to find a European answer to their problems. However, today, his government constitutes a majority in favour of blocking the extension of this mechanism. We do not understand this and ask you, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, to use all your power to break this deadlock.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe those who consistently argue for more flexicurity. Flexibility certainly exists, with widespread redundancies – day after day, we see jobs disappearing. Provide a little bit of security, allow these workers to be given training, a transitional period as they adapt to the new situation they find themselves in. I am worried that if this is the position of the Council today on the extension of the crisis mechanism, what will happen tomorrow when, as part of the financial perspectives, we are to negotiate the extension of mechanisms to all farmers affected by free trade agreements? There comes a time when the Council must choose between real solidarity and fake solidarity.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we prefer evidence and we do not believe the time has come for happy announcements of growth that might one day lead to job creation, or for the abolition of one of the few tools at the European Union’s disposal to provide concrete help, support and solidarity to workers affected not only by globalisation but, above all, by the financial crisis.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are counting on you, Mr President. You must change the majority in the Council, including among those Member States that are today refusing this extension of the derogation, despite being exemplary users of these funds.</p>

    <intervention id="2-103-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Nicolai Wammen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful to the Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Ms Berès, and the rapporteur, Ms Harkin, for giving the Presidency this opportunity to present the state of the proposal to extend the crisis derogation under the current European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the EGF.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to begin by recalling one important fact. The current EGF has not been repealed. It continues to function as decided by our two institutions back in 2006, and the authors of the questions suggest that the Council has come to the conclusion that the current crisis is over. I can assure you that is by no means the case. At the most recent meeting the other week, Heads of State or Government concluded that tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the current crisis was one of the main priorities for 2012. It is, of course, primarily up to each Member State to take the necessary measures and follow the policy it considers to be the most appropriate to combat unemployment. Even though this now happens within a strong European policy framework, the crisis derogation to the EGF was introduced for a limited time as a supplementary instrument for helping combat some of the consequences of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">When the Commission put forward its proposal to extend the mechanism, there was insufficient support within the Council. There were a number of reasons expressed by Member States as to why they were not ready to endorse the Commission’s proposal. In general, doubts over its added value persisted. Some Member States underlined that the labour market policies lie firmly within national competence. Others already have access to well-developed aid mechanisms at national level and consider the EGF contribution to be a useful but not essential complement to these mechanisms. Some felt it was inappropriate, at a time of national austerity, to introduce new unforeseen expenditure in the EU budget. These are just a few examples. Of course, there were also a significant number of Member States who supported the proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the Commission presented its proposal in the middle of last year, the Polish Presidency made a tremendous effort to find a solution which would meet the concerns of all Member States. However, the EPSCO Council in December failed to reach agreement on any of the compromise proposals tabled. Since then, the Danish Presidency has made further attempts and tabled a new compromise, but even recent efforts to try to break the deadlock through direct contacts with Ministers failed to achieve an outcome.</p>
      <p sl="en">As President, I regret that it was not possible to reach an acceptable compromise. However, we cannot, of course, oblige other Member States to change their positions. Under these conditions, we came to the conclusion that further negotiations on crisis derogation could hinder progress on the future EGF. There were good reasons for this. Already, early on in the discussions on the extension of the crisis derogation for the current EGF, it was underlined that the extensions would not pre-empt the negotiations on the future EGF.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, these negotiations take place within the context of the wider negotiations on the new multiannual financial framework. We had a first round of discussions on the future EGF on 27 February and I can assure the European Parliament that the Council will debate this proposal on its own merits. Here in Parliament, you have had preliminary discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and discussions so far both within the Council and here in Parliament showed that there are serious doubts about several important aspects of the new EGF regulation, notably, the inclusion of the agricultural sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to assure you of the commitment of the Danish Presidency to taking forward the discussions on the future EGF. I look forward both to hearing your views on this issue this morning as well as to the further work which will be needed between our two institutions as we seek to make progress in the negotiations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Wammen, I have listened to you very carefully, but you see before you someone who actively promotes the Globalisation Adjustment Fund on behalf of workers affected by the crisis as thousands of jobs are disappearing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Go and say what you just said to the 1 600 Irish Dell employees who lost their jobs! Go and tell that to the Portuguese, who have seen huge job losses in the textile industry or the Spanish, who have suffered job losses in the wood and ceramic industries and to the many others. The competitiveness of companies is at stake here, because the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which must allow us to reintegrate people affected by unemployment back into the labour market, also serves to make companies more competitive and you are therefore threatening the economic health of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, we are going through a time of crisis – we are still in crisis and certainly will be for some years. Fighting the crisis forms part of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Indeed, it is essential that, at the Council, you exercise true leadership to ensure that countries agree to this commitment to integrate the most vulnerable workers into economic life. It is all our futures, it is the credibility of Europe and it is the credibility of the Council, Mr President, that are at stake.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, this debate on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and the extension of crisis-related criteria concerns me in many respects, as it seems to me that, beyond the refusal to extend crisis-related criteria, it is the fund itself which is being targeted, particularly on the part of some Member States who no longer wish to hear mention of EU social action.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, the EGF is an essential part of EU action on restructuring. This importance has been intensified by the crisis and the current situation, whereby the European citizen is losing confidence in the EU. The increase, every year, in the number and volume of applications since 2006 goes to demonstrate this. Furthermore, this fund is seen to be an imperfect but effective tool, highly individualised and adapted to the needs of workers made redundant, for each specific case, whether in terms of training tailored to the needs of the region or support for job hunting. In addition, this opposition to EU employment and social action completely contradicts the conclusions of the Council on growth and employment. To make progress in this area, we must invest in instruments like the EGF and not rely solely on completing the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When the White Paper on pensions was published, keeping senior citizens in employment and increasing the effective retirement age were quite generally considered to be necessities. This fund, particularly in the context of the crisis, can and must contribute to this. Finally, in my view, the Commission’s proposal to include farmers is another indication of this desire for a ‘dismantling’. The EU has too few social tools to create inconsistent, hybrid tools from them, as this proposal suggests.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, it is essential that we ensure the future of a fund that responds to real needs, and thus to the crisis. Is the issue really that of crisis or non crisis-related criteria, or is it the desire of some to deny the social role of the EU?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as Ms Berès has already said, in December of last year, Parliament overwhelmingly supported the continuation of the crisis derogation. If we look at the applications that came into the EGF in December 2011, 13 applications under the crisis derogation came in December alone. What is astonishing is that three of those applications came in from one Member State that is objecting to the extension of the crisis derogation. I cannot make any sense of that and I really would like to hear an explanation from the relevant Member State.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have already heard the arguments here today about the crisis. We know the crisis is not over but what I again find astonishing is just one figure, that of youth unemployment. The average in the EU 27 is 21.6% but there are 11 Member States – not just two or three – there are 11 where the youth unemployment rate is over 25%. So we cannot, under any circumstances, say that the crisis has passed.</p>
      <p sl="de">So my question to the President-in-Office is: does the blocking minority support the EGF as an instrument in the first place? Are there some aspects or provisions in the fund which they object to? Do they believe that the fund does not deliver added value? If you look at the mid-term evaluation of the EGF, you will see that it delivers significant added value. Of course there are improvements which could be made, but the reintegration rate into employment is 41.8% and that is increasing in the medium term, so even from that perspective, the fund is delivering. I suppose my other question to you is: is this just an objection to social action in the first place?</p>
      <p sl="de">My final question is about the new EGF proposal. You talked about some problems with the proposal and you mentioned farmers. Are there any other issues that are causing problems within the Council with regard to the new EGF application?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Netherlands – EUR 30 million, Sweden – EUR 14 million, Denmark – EUR 50 million, Germany – EUR 37 million. Those are the amounts that these countries have received from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in recent years. How ironic then that these very countries, countries where the situation is relatively good, are now limiting access to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
      <p sl="nl">When the first signs of crisis appeared, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund was extended to large businesses and industry sectors which were going bankrupt because of the crisis, with the threat of thousands of redundancies as a result. If only it were true that that extension was no longer needed, that the crisis was already behind us, and that crisis-triggered bankruptcies no longer caused mass redundancies. The opposite is true, however.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In these times of cuts, the crisis is becoming increasingly tangible in all countries. The crisis is being used as the reason for mass redundancies. I find it cruel and morally unacceptable that countries like the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden are blocking the crisis derogation. In fact, I find it incomprehensible. These countries are against the derogation because they are opposed to the fund in general. The EGF should not exist in the first place, the reasoning seems to go, so we can, therefore, give ourselves carte blanche to oppose absolutely everything to do with it, while, in the meantime, obviously making good use of it ourselves, since the Netherlands, as Ms Harkin said, raked in another EUR 8 million at the very end of 2011. The adult reasoning on this matter should, of course, be that, while this fund continues to exist, it should be used as effectively as possible. The crisis is being used as a very handy excuse.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund has been a complete failure. Every year, the Commission takes EUR 500 million of taxpayers’ money and sprinkles it about in the vain hope of being seen to do something about job losses.</p>
      <p sl="en">The functioning of this fund has been appalling. It is bureaucratic and inefficient with the Commission making up the rules as they go along. In 2009, we had the ridiculous situation of the Commission paying money to Ireland because Dell had relocated to Poland. That is not globalisation. That is the single market working. I wholeheartedly support the British, Czech and other governments who are blocking the extension of this absurd fund. Rather than pouring this money down the drain, we should return it to the taxpayers, who will spend it far more wisely than the European Union ever could.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the salvation of millions of unemployed Europeans does not depend on the unreliable aid offered by the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). Statistics highlight the fact that the majority of the beneficiaries of the fund cannot find a new job, while the luckier ones are absorbed back into the job market with fixed-term contracts which can last as few as six months. In many cases, those who are unemployed opt out of the fund because they question its usefulness.</p>
      <p sl="it">The EGF is not a solution and it does not prevent the disastrous consequences of a European commercial policy, which is managed dangerously and with too much flippancy by the Commission. To fight the plague of unemployment, which is now structural, Europe must rein in its excessive openness towards the markets of developing countries, whose unfair competition is the root cause of the failure of our businesses.</p>
      <p sl="it">Until Europe stops giving succour to economic self-destruction by defending a position that is blind to global trade flows, our businesses will continue to fail. The fund can only provide temporary support, but training courses are not the way to give our unemployed comfort and security.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, in its 2008 Economic Recovery Plan, the Commission deemed it important to amend and render more flexible the rules governing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as part of our efforts to overcome the crisis. Accordingly, in 2009, the Council eased access to the assets of the fund in order to address the first wave of the crisis. The guiding principles behind the Council’s introduction of derogation in 2009 were solidarity and social justice. Considering these principles, it is incomprehensible why the Council would show reluctance to extend the effect of derogation while the crisis continues to mount.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Even in my immediate surroundings, I see the bankruptcies of venerable companies like MALÉV Hungarian Airlines and the Komárom shipyards, as well as closures such as that of the Komárom plant of Nokia, which employed over 1 200 people from both sides of the country border. In light of these circumstances, we do not really see any justification for the dismissive attitude of the Council and the obstructive minority. Globalisation and crisis go hand in hand. We can see how the crisis has accelerated globalisation. As regards their consequences, these two processes are virtually identical in some regions. It is unacceptable for anyone to attempt extortion by claiming that the extension of derogation would jeopardise the future of the EGF. What I ask of the representatives of the Council is to not consider either their response or their efforts as definite.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to express my opposition to the removal of the crisis derogation from the Globalisation Fund and I would urge the Council to work with the minority of blocking Member States and ask them to reconsider their position and arrive at a conclusion.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Ireland, between 2009 and 2011, 70% of the applications for the EGF Fund were crisis-related. Companies such as SR Technics, Dell, Waterford Crystal and companies from the construction industry applied and availed of this fund to upskill thousands of workers and help them find alternative employment. Just last week, we had the announcement in Ireland that 2 500 bank officials are to be made redundant in the second largest bank in Ireland, AIB. This would be the equivalent to 45 000 job losses in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="en">We spent the morning discussing that fiscal consolidation must be accompanied by a jobs and growth strategy. If we are to do more than pay lip-service to this, we need to ensure that the crisis derogation is retained for the EGF funding.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, it is worth saying quite clearly that it is thanks to the derogation we are discussing today that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund has become one of the European Union’s most widely used tools to mitigate the effects of the economic crisis. In my opinion, this fund is an expression of Community-wide budgetary solidarity with workers who are made redundant. The reluctance on the part of some Member States to extend this crisis derogation surprises me very much. It amazes me even more that the citizens of those states which are currently blocking the extension of the derogation have benefited from assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. I would also like to ask the Minister how he imagines a conversation or a debate on the new regulation after 2013 in the light of this blocking minority.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Naturally, I hope that the Danish Presidency will finally be able to work out a compromise on issues relating to the fund and to persuade the Council to reconsider this issue in a positive light. Meanwhile, we would be glad to hear the specific concerns, fears and reasons why these blocking Member States do not want to extend the crisis derogation, because this is not clear, at least not to me. Perhaps there are such reasons, even compelling ones, which we are not aware of – the Minister mentioned one such reason, namely, that in some Member States, and by implication the blocking ones, there are other mechanisms to support workers made redundant. This is possible, but the question is this: why do these states nevertheless try to obtain – and succeed in doing so – funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. These issues were not addressed in your introductory speech and I hope that we, as Members of the European Parliament, will be informed of these shortly. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I am very sorry that the Danish Presidency has lost heart … (microphone not working). It is naïve to think that the crisis in the European Union ended last year and that people are consequently no longer being made redundant. Sadly, I doubt whether the crisis in the European Union will end in the next couple of years. Real life indicates otherwise. Much more time may be required for the European Union’s economic recovery. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund support mechanism has been improved with temporary measures and many more unemployed European Union citizens have been able to get support and find new jobs as a result. My country, Lithuania, has utilised EGF assistance very effectively. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a European Union solidarity fund, solidarity-based assistance for people who have been made redundant, and therefore, while appreciating the position of the blocking Member States, it is natural to ask whether this means that the principle of solidarity will cease to exist in the European Union?</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, apologies, but there are things I do not understand. I do not understand this double game between the Council and the Commission when it comes to this fund. Some are blocking its continued use for the crisis, but at the same time, the same countries doing the blocking are those that continue to use it the most. Meanwhile others, namely the Commission, which seem to be defending it before the Council, are, at the same time, presenting a proposal that completely removes its reason for being.</p>
      <p sl="es">We all know there are two ways to destroy a programme. The first is to do away with the funding completely, and the second and subtler way is to distort it little by little until the reason for its existence has gone. This is precisely what we are risking at this point in the debate.</p>

However, using this fund to do so without increasing the items, without clarifying the requirements, is an attempt to deceive everyone – companies, workers and farmers. This is because, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 500 million may be insufficient to help companies that are in difficulties, but the same money for the same companies and for hundreds of thousands of farmers is simply ridiculous.</p>
      <p sl="es">This Parliament has a clear message in that it is our desire to preserve this element of solidarity at a time when it is more important than ever.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis is not yet behind Europe; European enterprises are in serious difficulty and our workers are continuing to pay the highest price by losing their jobs. Since its creation in 2006, this fund has offered an exemplary response, helping to support the reintegration of workers into new jobs.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Member States have said that the majority of the requests could not have been made without the economic crisis derogation, meaning that 45 000 workers would have been left out of work. The political message sent by the Council’s rejection of this decision is a strike at the very heart of the credibility and responsibility of the European institutions. I therefore appeal strongly to the Council to make unblocking the derogation one of its priorities and I would ask my fellow Members to respect those who are speaking.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the European Commission impact study, of December 2011, on the possible trade agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, shows us drops of 1.6% in European farmers’ incomes and of 0.4% in those incomes of persons employed in European farming.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We can also see from the report that, in addition to these average figures for the meat market, the impact will be greater in a number of Member States, with 2-3% for beef in countries like Ireland, Belgium, Denmark and Luxembourg. In French regions like Limousin or Auvergne, its negative impact will be as high as 3-7.5%.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Can Mr Wammen confirm the figure of EUR 7 billion for this agreement’s negative impact on European agriculture by 2020? If the figure for negative impact is EUR 7 billion, how can the Commission’s proposed response to this problem be to spend EUR 2.5 billion from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the period 2014-2020?

      <p sl="de">Mr President, since 2009, the fund has been used to help not only people who have lost their jobs as a result of globalisation, but also those who have been made unemployed as a consequence of the crisis. Measures of this kind are very useful as a short-term response. Targeted economic measures can help to prevent social injustice and emergency situations and also to support companies. However, it does not make sense to change the function of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) permanently. The derogation only provides for an increase in the EU’s contribution to around 65%. In the long term, that will be counterproductive. Appropriate cofinancing from the Member States will also guarantee that the money is used for the intended purposes. In addition, a permanently low level of involvement would reduce the responsibility taken by the Member States and the regions. However, their responsibility must be increased, in order to enable us to avoid future crises by making efficient use of funding.</p>

That was not possible, and now we will be working on the future of the EGF. I will be looking forward to constructive cooperation with this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also like to make it very clear that the Danish Presidency, and the Council, are firmly committed to combating the crisis as we know it because, as many Members in this Chamber have made clear, the crisis is not over yet.

      <p sl="ro">I think that the derogation in relation to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) needs to be extended in the current climate. This instrument has proved to be useful so far in mitigating the impact of the economic crisis and preventing other social disasters. I think that it is important to adapt the fund in order to continue in this vein and guide the economy towards sustainable growth. This mechanism is needed, in particular, for workers, the victims of the crisis, who need to find a solution to their problems. We must support workers who have been made redundant in their efforts to find a new job, and the assistance provided by the EU on this score must be more dynamic so as to meet their needs.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In December, Romania applied to the European Commission for financial assistance through the EGF for employees from Nokia, which decided to move its business activities to Asia. I should mention that last September, Nokia announced the closure of its factory in Jucu and the moving of its business activities to China, even though the factory, which is near Cluj, posted a turnover in 2010 that was up more than 55% on the previous year. My country’s position is in favour of retaining this instrument with a European cofinancing rate of 65%.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The economic crisis has resulted in the decline of economic activity and entailed a rise in unemployment against the background of a productivity slump and deterioration in the public finance system. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) had to be adapted in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis. Recent forecasts indicate that there will continue to be structural changes in economic sectors which will give rise to job losses due to some companies closing down or others relocating. I would like to emphasise that many Member States have not enjoyed the benefits of the EGF so far because they have not been faced with huge closures or relocations. Due to the recent restructuring among businesses, there is the risk of redundancies becoming a frequent occurrence in the period immediately ahead. This is why I think that extending the derogation against the backdrop of the crisis is an absolute must. The importance of providing funding with the support of the EGF lies in its flexibility. By providing aid promptly to the affected workers for a limited period of time, the EGF helps reduce unemployment and enables Member States to emerge from the economic crisis en route towards smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The extension of the crisis derogation must be maintained, at least temporarily. Relocation is undoubtedly, at least for the time being, crucial for European capital in search of areas where wages are lower. The European Union created this fund to tackle the impact of globalisation. It is a completely different discussion as to how effective it is. At the moment, however, we do not have any instrument to allow us to mitigate the impact of bankruptcy or the decline in activity due not to globalisation, but simply to the economic crisis. Initiatives relating to research and innovation and increasing competitiveness are economically correct, but their impact is only felt in the long term. Until then, Europe needs to overcome the crisis. Either a new instrument with a specific purpose or the extension of the derogation is necessary from this perspective.</p>

Back in 2005, as a lawyer fighting for women and their children who had suffered abuse, and for the protection of their lives and physical integrity, I launched, among other things, a campaign for the protection of several such abused women and children. One of the husbands involved took offence and filed a police report against me for defamation. Until my election as a Member of the European Parliament, the case had been at a standstill. Then, in 2010, the proceedings suddenly got under way. One and a half years ago, the waiver of my immunity was requested. The case had been lying dormant before the European Parliament ever since. What is the reason for its suddenly becoming so important that a vote had to be called overnight? Why am I not allowed to state my position on the case?

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to explain on behalf of the Irish EPP delegation that we abstained from the vote on the Lechner report because the Irish Government expressed reservations about this report in regard to the use of habitual residence as the connecting factor in the absence of a choice of law, the effect of the regulation on the system of administration which exists in Ireland and the issue of lifetime gifts or clawback.</p>
      <p sl="en">While some progress was made on the issue of habitual residence, the issue of administration of estates and the restoration of lifetime gifts or clawback were not resolved to Ireland’s satisfaction.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, along with my group, the ECR, I abstained on the Lechner report on jurisdiction and matters of succession and on the creation of a European Certificate of Succession. We agree with the report for the most part but found it difficult to agree on the clawback mechanism as this mechanism is alien to the legal system and traditions in England and Wales, which I represent.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would be concerned, were it introduced, that it would adversely affect charities in the UK as it would affect the certainty with which they can view donations. The clawback mechanism applies retrospectively. There is potential for gifts or donations given to charities during the lifetime of a benefactor then being annulled by their legal heirs upon the benefactor’s death. Given the Council’s refusal to allow an exception on this point for the UK, we felt in the ECR that we could not opt into this regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we are again reminded of the difference between the common law system that prevails in England and Ireland, and the Roman or Bonapartist model which prevails across most of the rest of the continent. Our system tends to exalt individual freedom and property rights over whatever notion of collective good, and this difference in succession laws is a neat illustration. To simplify, our system allows you far more leeway over bequeathing your property to whomever you like without the state coming in and declaring your will illegal.</p>
      <p sl="en">Naturally enough, this report follows the prevalent model on the continent. We are reminded yet again that harmonisation more often than not puts us in the minority through no fault of the system; it is just that we are the odd ones out. We are reminded again of that little miracle that happened when the common law system was invented. This extraordinary, sublime idea that law does not emanate from the state, but rather that there was a folk right of existing law that even the king and his ministers were subject to. How it happened I do not know, but it served to make us a free people and that we have accepted this alien system as superior over it leaves us dwindled as a nation, diminished as a people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, one of the cross-cutting themes in this report is the call for wider representation of women on boards of companies, an aspiration that I entirely agree with. More diversity on boards, when twinned with effective selection procedures that put the correct focus on expertise and experience, has been proven to be good for corporate governance.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I cannot support the concept of mandatory quotas. Not only is it patronising to women, it is completely against the concept of shareholder engagement that we are all so keen to foster in European companies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The best way to achieve meaningful, non-tokenistic representation of women on boards is by industry initiatives, such as the 30% club in the United Kingdom, which encourages business leaders to take affirmative action in moving voluntarily towards a better gender balance at all levels of their organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach has the added benefit of encouraging institutional shareholders to take a positive role in promoting women to positions of leadership, but the real problem of gender equality exists one step down, at the management level. Correcting this will involve long-term planning.</p>

I actually feel the need to thank the rapporteur for providing proof of the runaway integration frenzy that is permeating this whole institution. Reading through this report, there is hardly a detail out there in the Member States that I feel there is a need for the EU to interfere in. There was a time when we had something we called the principle of subsidiarity – that is to say, the condition that the EU would not interfere unless it was absolutely necessary. If the Member States could deal with a matter themselves, then they should do so. Reading through this report, I see no trace of this principle of subsidiarity: matrimonial law, day nurseries, registered partnerships, nursery school opening times, the definition of the concept of family, maternity leave and wage formation – all of this is included in this report as something that the EU should interfere in. If it was not actually laughable, it would be enough to make you cry. We already have regulations covering the likes of whether we can blow up balloons and whether we have to give the name of a fish in our mother tongue or in Latin.

      <p sl="it">Sixty per cent of our graduates are women but there is no doubt that accessing the world of work is tricky when women choose family life as well as work. The family needs to be safeguarded and protected, while the gender gap definitely has to be significantly reduced through well-defined social policies, greater working flexibility and, of course, by protecting vulnerable women.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report by the Committee on Women’s Rights on equality between men and women in the EU highlights a number of ongoing concerns. I am pleased that the report addresses a number of these.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, I agree it is frustrating that progress on gender equality is slowing, if not at a standstill. We must address – especially in times of economic crisis where belts are tightening – the problem that women earn, on average, 17.5% less than men across the EU. Gender stereotypes, often leading to discrimination in the workplace, must also be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The call for the European observatory on gender-based violence to be made operational as soon as possible is fully supported, while I agree that the EU Victims’ Package must include provisions to support women who have been forced to marry or who have been the victims of genital mutilation as a result of religious practices.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the report goes on to call for EU influence over maternity leave, quotas for female representation in elected positions, the combating of gender-based violence through EU-wide legal instruments and pension rights, all of which I believe are better addressed at a national level rather than at a European level. On issues such as quotas, I firmly believe it is up to the nation state and national parties to decide how they will address the gender imbalance. There are many points of agreement within this report, but often it goes too far and I cannot support this.</p>

That is a practice that must end and reports would be more profitable if they were to uphold the right to life of young girls such as those highlighted in the Daily Telegraph report.

Meanwhile, abused women and their children are like fugitives, without any option for legal protection, as seen for example in Hungary.

Equality does not mean a denial of the exceptionality of women, mothers, but the valuing of motherhood and allowing women freedom in their self-realisation. In this, however, the report failed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Instead of supporting motherhood, the report underlines the value of abortion.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this report is a classic example of do as I say, not as I do. One would expect the EU institutions themselves with many politically appointed executives to be leading the way. I cannot understand why one of the most influential institutions in the EU, namely, the European Central Bank, does not get included in the scope of this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">We sit and lecture and mandate gender equality for any number of private institutions and already have legislative proposals on the table covering diversity on the boards of financial institutions, yet the ECB itself does not currently have a single woman on its executive board. Many Member States still think it is acceptable to consider an all-male shortlist every time a position on the ECB comes up. I refuse to accept that there are no competent women out there able to take part in economic decisions that affect the lives of over 500 million EU citizens, or that the Bank’s dealings with Greece and other troubled economies over the coming years would not benefit from a female perspective. Let the EU institutions fix their own gender deficit before turning to others.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, as a young elected female representative, I feel it important to outline my opposition towards the report on women in political decision making.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is regrettable that women are so badly under-represented in politics. We must encourage improvement on the 24% EU national average of women in political decision-making roles. The situation is even worse in Westminster in the UK where 22% of Members of Parliament are women. Considering that 51% of the UK population is female, this imbalance becomes stark. I therefore support ideas such as mentoring programmes, whereby training and exchange programmes could be used to better promote young women’s political participation and I commend the work of the Conservative Women’s Organisation in the UK in encouraging young women. I even recognise that my own Conservative Party has tried to promote women by supporting all-women shortlists, as David Cameron did in 2009, and so it should be that nation states and parties within nation states should have the freedom to address the gender imbalance as they see fit.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, what I do oppose is the EU creating a top-down approach, whereby they impose quotas and other measures to address the gender imbalance.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I think we would all agree that women are a tremendous asset to the whole of our society. For example, for nearly 20 years, my party has had remarkable success with a female chair.</p>
      <p sl="da">However, the big question is this: is this really the only human characteristic that is important? If we have quotas for women because they are women, then why not have quotas for many other things? What about geographical quotas? I am sure that no one would claim that a candidate from the regions would be less qualified than a candidate from a city. Or what about age quotas? I am certain that on very many of the lists and the boards of directors around Europe, there is a clear excess of older people. Is that not an unreasonable case of discrimination? Or what about sexual quotas? A homosexual is obviously just as good a person as a heterosexual. Around one in twenty of Europe’s citizens are homosexual, so how about creating homosexual quotas? This would result in us operating in a state of chaos.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would therefore like to make it clear that the reason I have voted against this report today is not that I am against women, elderly people or homosexuals; it is because I am against quotas and the idea that people can be tallied up in quotas. Quotas are for fish, CO2 and things like that, not for people of flesh and blood.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, equality between men and women, and a derivative thereof, equal rights for men and women, are achievements, or rather, a principle which no sensible person, in my opinion, can continue to question. That, indeed, includes me, as well, and it is one of the major reasons why I consider Islam, for example, completely incompatible with the principles of constitutional democracy with which we, in Europe, are fortunately familiar.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, that said, I remain immovably opposed to a quota system whereby the representation of women in political decision making is boosted artificially. It is the responsibility of the voters, 50% of whom are women anyway, to elect their own representatives.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is most probable that more men than women take an active interest in politics nowadays. That is not merely a consequence of discrimination. If, for once, we could agree on that amongst ourselves, as adults, then that in itself would be a step forward. But no, that does not seem to be possible and so, with this report, we remain in the realm of victim rhetoric and that is a pity.</p>

      <p sl="it">In order to achieve equality between men and women, we must first of all remove the cultural obstacles and start to talk about gender policy. The parties themselves have got to initiate this first step towards change. Various positive measures are put forward in Ms Pietikäinen’s report, which I wholeheartedly support. These include the measures on quotas for women which, while not the ideal solution, are the only feasible approach until we see a change of culture and outlook, as I said.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally benefited from a quota system as my faculty of law, the most prestigious faculty of law in Bulgaria, admitted an equal number of boys and girls and, if this had not been the case, it is most likely that I might not have got in and completed my legal education. However, was it fair that I and a few other boys took places from girls who were better prepared than us and fared better in the exams?</p>
      <p sl="bg">You know fine well that the answer to this question is ‘no’. This is why I am against setting quotas. My first child was born recently – a beautiful little girl. Like any parent, I want her to do better than me and, when she has grown up, I want her to successfully make her way in her professional life and career thanks to her abilities and not to charity in the form of quotas as, unfortunately, her father has done.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am sure that I speak for the vast majority of women in saying that we want career advancement on the basis of merit, on our ability to actually do the job, rather than on our gender. I want people to vote for me on my record of representation, not because I am a woman. I certainly do not want someone else to suffer discrimination in order to advance my career. Capable, ambitious women want to reach the pinnacle of their careers on what they have achieved and what they can offer. To progress because you are a woman in order to meet an EU statistic would be a hollow achievement indeed.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe that this is a matter for national governments and political parties and their electorates. Although I do not oppose the notion of introducing targets at national level, I again feel strongly that this is a matter to be organised by the Member States as they see fit within their own political systems.

I strongly believe – as do some of my female colleagues who have already spoken – and I am glad that it is women who are talking about this, that they are offended that we are supposed to lay down, in some artificial way, whether they are to be allowed to speak, or whether they are to occupy some very important position.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Yes, the joint declaration adopted at the 66th UN General Assembly in New York recommends ever greater political participation by women, because this has a positive meaning for democracy, etc. Of course, there are many documents that encourage Member States to work towards eliminating discrimination. I can agree with that. However, I strongly believe that the introduction of quotas for women is not the right approach, and rather demeans women. Reserving places through quotas so that women can have more of a say, when, in the normal competition of people and ideas, they can honestly argue their position, is misguided.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am very happy to support this own-initiative report – and that is what it is, an own-initiative report. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report which sets out some very practical and realistic measures, unlike the last report which we debated here.</p>
      <p sl="en">Gender quotas, in my opinion, are the only real means of change. I look at the Irish Parliament. It has a record high of 26 females since we got our independence in 1922 – that is what we have now. In percentage terms, it only represents 16% of the composition of Parliament, a far cry from the 30% target set by the UN.</p>
      <p sl="en">We need to reinvent our political system so that it is gender-balanced. I look at Spain, for example, and Belgium, where they introduced gender quotas. The proportions of women in Parliament have rocketed since the introduction of legally-binding quotas. Belgium, for example: 12.7% in 2007, 35% now; Spain: 26% in 2008, 36.3% now; but I want to emphasise that it is only a very temporary measure until we get gender balance – because that is what it is all about.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, advocates of quotas do not want women to have the freedom to choose. They want to decide for them. According to them, the ambitions of women are the same as the ambitions of men. To manage a company, political party or government. Children and family are an obstacle. To overcome it, the right to abortion and employment quotas must be introduced. However, quotas do not solve discrimination, they deepen it. The majority of women also have the ambition of becoming mothers. They are discriminated against because they do a lot of work that nobody wants to see. From the employers’ perspective, the readiness of women to care for their nearest and dearest is a risk that they deal with through not hiring women, lower pay or career stagnation. Lower pay is then reflected negatively in the retirement pensions of each and every mother. From the viewpoint of women, then, this is a threefold injustice. This is the real problem facing women of today. I was unable to vote for the report.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, first of all, I would like to say that this report by Ms Pietikäinen is excellent and well worth supporting. I voted in favour of it, and if we compare this to the report by Ms in ’t Veld, which we were just dealing with, there is a huge difference. These issues have been put in the right context and are based on the very notion that competence is the decisive factor. In Europe, however, we still have some way to go until such decisions would be based on competence alone.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need employment, we need education and training as well as an attitude that supports the idea that men and women should be treated equally in the labour market and in different roles. That is why I believe that quotas will be a temporary solution in political decision making.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need action, because talking is not enough. There are good examples of this: in the European Central Bank, for example, where there is not a single woman, as has been made apparent here too. I do, of course, know that in some countries, there are offices of the ombudsman for equality where there is not a single man, and so on. The basic assumption must be that men and women should be involved in decision making, and I believe that this is a way to strengthen this trend in different countries, so that equality can become a reality.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, first and foremost, to express my very sincere appreciation for Mr Giegold’s work on this own-initiative report. I also recall that we share with him and with others an active presence in Parliament’s Social Economy Intergroup.</p>
      <p sl="it">My political group, as you know, believes that the social model is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European integration project. Therefore, this is not just a simple policy, or one of many; it is a policy that characterises our entire project. In this day and age, with the attacks relating to the need for public spending cuts as well, we still firmly support this priority. We know that it may be as a revised or modified social model, but we believe that it should be retained, defended and reaffirmed as a priority.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I believe that, in this same vision, we must also promote business entities, such as cooperatives, which produce goods and services and have a very special role in the so-called European social economy. These businesses reassert the fact that it is possible to be productive, to do good things, to be efficient even if the goal is not profit but rather, for example, employment, welfare, labour development and contributing to the life of the local community.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is why it is important – I am finishing here, Madam President – for Europe to make the appropriate instruments available for an active policy and make a good statute – not the one that exists now, which is unusable, but a good statute for cooperatives which can be a way to help this very important sector.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, cooperatives have a hugely important role in local economies, particularly in this time of economic hardship when necessary cuts are being made to public services. Setting up local cooperatives to meet local needs should be the obvious solution.</p>

      <p sl="en">The real problem is the huge amount of red tape and bureaucracy that any number of other EU directives and regulations create and thus stifle small businesses, no matter whether they are organised as cooperatives, social enterprises or for-profit businesses.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the initiative to revise the directive on European cooperative societies as specified in Article 17, so as to factor in the specific needs of workers. Their involvement in cooperatives is vital and it needs to take place under the most favourable conditions possible.

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the role of the cooperative movement has always been important for creating a more balanced and just economy. Currently, while we are going through one of the most serious economic and social crises since the war, the function of cooperative societies has become crucial. It is quite clear that where there has been substantial development of the cooperative dimension in the economy, the result has been an increase in employment, more skilled labour and more equitable redistribution of the wealth generated.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, it is good that the European Union has adopted a statute for cooperative societies, but now more than ever, there needs to be a real simplification of the rules. We need to give new incentives for the creation of a common European framework on cooperatives and this must occur by giving assistance and not creating bureaucratic obstacles.

      <p sl="it">However, I must regretfully note that the European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success, given its scarce use: in 2010, only 17 SCEs were registered. This should make us question the applicability of the legal framework. I believe that today, more than ever, simplification is needed to enable small organisations to access information on national provisions for implementing regulations and directives.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, I think we need to remember the commitments undertaken by the Commission, in particular, to include cooperatives among the financial instruments of the European Investment Fund and to make explicit reference to more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as easier access to loans and tax concessions.

We know perfectly well that some cooperatives practise truly predatory behaviour, like the Finnish cooperative which just wiped M-real Alizay off the map, leaving more than 400 employees by the wayside. This is true and it is shameful, but, as a general rule, cooperatives behave completely differently and, above all, in many situations, this type of company enables employees to save and develop businesses that we simply wanted to eliminate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Bologna process is part of an ongoing task to create a European Higher Education Area which will help to facilitate the mobility of students and professionals. I believe that education is a key factor in boosting economic growth and, as such, I was able to support some of the aspects of the report. I was also the rapporteur of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, in which I highlighted the important role of research, employability, mobility and the importance of university-business dialogue in essential links of the Bologna process, with the connections in the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems, however, that some have been carried away in the drafting of this report and it includes elements which are very difficult for me to support. As a British Conservative, I cannot support the repeated calls for more funding and increased public investment in higher education at a time of difficult cuts for many Member States, my own included. In addition to this, the report calls for harmonisation of academic standards and for strong financial support where there are agreements on common core curricula. Education is the competence of the Member States and it should remain that way. On this basis, I have had to vote against this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, mobility is an important principle of the single market. Also, many students find studying abroad to be a rewarding experience. However, I do not believe this means we need to accept the rigid recommendations of the Bologna process, not least because education is a Member State competence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Three of the top universities in the world are in the UK, with one of them, Imperial College, in my home constituency of London. There is a danger that the Bologna process, with its emphasis on an academic credit system, will lead to a mechanical approach to learning or, worse still, the dumbing down of British universities. Student success should be based on their achievements, not the number of hours they spend in the lecture hall. I will be saying ‘no’ to this report and I voted against it.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Berlinguer, whom I congratulate on the work and the excellent analysis he carried out. The report fully highlights the problems and shortcomings that are obstructing the effective development of the European Higher Education Area.</p>
      <p sl="it">In particular, I am referring to the inadequate relationship between universities and the world of work, to the still unfinished revision of the national systems of quality assurance and to unfair access to university educational systems. Therefore, I share my fellow Member’s calls for the adoption of a common system of quality assurance in order to establish mutual recognition of university qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, I hope that the next ministerial conference, scheduled to take place in April, will address the sore point of the issue: the need and urgency to move quickly in the process of revising the directives on professional qualifications and their recognition.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1999, with the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European signatory countries committed to working together to create a European Higher Education Area by 2010. This target would have guaranteed academic quality, economic development and social cohesion, and employment and lifelong learning for graduates. I support Mr Berlinguer’s report because it calls for decisive and coordinated action at European level.</p>
      <p sl="it">The recognition of degrees based on an efficient system of quality assurance constitutes a good point of departure for encouraging Member States to adopt the national framework of qualifications for lifelong learning. It is essential to implement and develop a European system of higher education that allows and encourages the free movement of knowledge.

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I voted for this report because the European Union needs good-quality education which will foster research and innovation. Young people must be able to develop a wide range of skills so that they can become integrated into and adapt quickly to the labour market. Given the difficulties encountered in finding the first job, I should stress the importance of internships and professional integration programmes. The recognition of diplomas and professional qualifications is not only vital for encouraging student mobility, but also for the single market and the free movement of workers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that the ministerial meeting in Bucharest in April will yield positive results, contributing to the development of the European Higher Education Area.

We still have students today who gain degrees through Erasmus that are subsequently not recognised by their own universities or only allow enrolment in universities that are too different and sometimes even of questionable standing.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a European Higher Education Area is a major goal that the European Union has set for itself. However, despite the progress made with the Bologna Declaration – which, as noted, dates back to 1999 – we have got to recognise the fact that in terms of student mobility and the harmonisation of degrees across the various countries, the results have been far from satisfactory.</p>
      <p sl="it">That is why I voted in favour of this report. We need to move forward with greater speed on this issue and reverse the trend – especially in some countries – of cutting investment in education. Accordingly, the harmonisation put forward under the Bologna Declaration is still essential in order to improve the entire European education system and make the labour market more dynamic.

      <p sl="en">A particular concern to the British Conservative Delegation are the repeated calls for more places and funding for higher education.

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of this report by Mr Berlinguer because it will be very good and important for the European Higher Education Area and its development. The Bologna process has been a success story. The objective therein proposed by Mr Berlinguer himself – and, of course, he was one of the ministers who set this process in motion at the Sorbonne back in 1998-1999 – that all EU nationals could be on the same starting line in terms of qualifications and thus be placed in employment in different areas of the internal market and beyond, and that there should be equivalence between qualifications, is an excellent one, and we should work towards it.</p>
      <p sl="fi">A total of 47 countries are party to the process. We all know that the European Union’s power is based on open coordination, and that is what is being employed here. We also need to remember that it is the Member States that have the ultimate power.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The British university and higher education system has benefited from this.

In Slovakia, we have good experiences from comparisons of the quality of education and research in universities. The creation of an academic ranking agency has given not only the government, but most importantly students, a reliable tool when deciding on their future studies.

The investigation in this particular case required extensive cooperation between Norway and other European countries, including Poland. This agreement makes it possible, inter alia, to hear witnesses, experts and defendants via video conferencing, which will mean significant improvements to criminal proceedings conducted by the police in different countries.

      <p sl="sk">In December 2002, the Council authorised the Council Presidency, assisted by the European Commission, to start negotiating an agreement on mutual legal assistance with Norway and Iceland. Now, under the new legal framework resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon, the approval of Parliament is required. This agreement is aimed at improving judicial cooperation between the Member States of the EU and Norway and Iceland by the application of almost all the provisions under the Convention of 2000 on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States and its protocol adopted in 2001. It includes, inter alia, provisions on the hearing of witnesses, experts and accused persons by telephone or video conference, on controlled deliveries, covert investigations and joint investigation teams, and on requests for information on banking transactions and bank accounts and their monitoring to combat crime in general and organised crime in particular. Under it, Norway and Iceland are extending the rules on mutual legal assistance that are currently in force and that are usually applied in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I firmly believe that the agreement will help in the fight against cross-border crime and enhance cooperation with the two countries, which are now in the Schengen area, while one of them, Iceland, is currently in negotiations on accession to the EU.

      <p sl="pl">The basic idea behind the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 2000 and the Protocol thereto is to enable, on the one hand, Member States to take measures within the framework of criminal proceedings in relation to persons residing in other Members States, and, on the other hand, to enable these persons to participate actively in proceedings in order to protect their interests or exercise their rights. These acts are therefore an important element in shaping the area of freedom, security and justice. The Convention and the Protocol set out the legal framework within which the relevant authorities of Member States conducting proceedings may operate, and stipulate procedural conditions and prerequisites for their adoption. These tools increase the effectiveness of procedures for holding people responsible for breaking the law and, as a consequence, provide a better guarantee of the rule of law and protect the interests of people in the area covered by the regulations. At the same time, they facilitate the realisation of the right to a trial. Extending their effectiveness to all Member States and to countries which have close ties with the EU, as well as to candidate countries, is a natural consequence of accepting the common ideas of freedom, security and justice. The agreement is another formal step toward the realisation of such ideas. Its validity is not in question.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Combating crime involves enhanced dialogue between the judicial authorities of the Member States and the increased joint action thereof. Judicial cooperation on criminal matters is based on the principle of mutual recognition of sentences and court judgments by the Member States, and involves national legislation on the application of common minimum rules. As such, since they apply almost all the provisions of the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union and the 2001 Protocol thereto, legal cooperation between the Member States of the EU and Norway and Iceland is becoming a reality. The agreement in question includes provisions of great importance, such as those on hearing of witnesses, experts and accused persons by telephone or video conference, controlled deliveries, covert investigations and joint investigation teams, and requests for information on banking transactions and bank accounts and for their monitoring to combat crime in general and organised crime in particular.

      <p sl="pt">The harmonisation of legislation on succession rights is crucial if the European public is to cease to be an abstract concept in this regard. This will prevent confused interpretations on the part of courts and consultants and create a clearer system: it will become known what laws are applicable and where. For its part, the creation of a European Certificate of Succession would provide family members with a mechanism for validating their ownership of property with cross-border implications.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this regulation which aims to remove the obstacles to the free movement of persons who currently face difficulties in asserting their rights in the context of a succession with cross-border implications. At present, citizens have difficulties in foreseeing which country and authority (court, notary, administrator, etc.) have competence in handling the succession and this situation obviously creates legal uncertainty because citizens must be able to organise their succession in advance. This regulation will enable citizens to organise their succession in advance by choosing the law applicable to their wills. This regulation introduces a European Certificate of Succession, which will enable the succession to be settled in a shorter period of time.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This new regulation on cross-border successions will prevent future legal battles and lengthy proceedings to settle successions when the laws of several European Union countries apply. Today, we travel, study and live in several European Union countries and mixed marriages are, as a result, continually on the increase. Therefore, the aim is to facilitate the free movement of citizens and to strengthen the internal market. I therefore voted in favour of the creation of a European Certificate of Succession, which will allow heirs to demonstrate their status as heir or the attribution of a specific asset.

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. The mobility of citizens in the EU is increasing and, in civil and commercial legal relations involving interests in several Member States, this often leads to various questions, such as establishing which Member State court is competent to address an issue that has arisen, which legal system will be applied, and the procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, etc. The Treaty establishing the European Community sets out the objective of progressively establishing a common area of freedom, security and justice, in particular, by adopting measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters. This proposed regulation is aimed at addressing legal issues regarding cross-border succession in order to ensure greater legal clarity for EU citizens and simplicity when exercising their rights in cross-border succession cases. This regulation also introduces an important innovation – the European Certificate of Succession, which will enable heirs, administrators of the estate or executors of the will to demonstrate their status without any other formalities. This will represent great progress compared to the current situation and matters of succession will be dealt with more swiftly and cheaply.</p>

This piece of EU legislation will, in future, be of particular benefit to our citizens, an increasing number of whom are leaving to live and work abroad, or who simply acquire property in other countries. It is nevertheless regrettable that for now, the UK and Ireland have announced that they will not opt in to this regulation due to the specific regulation of certain aspects of succession in their countries.

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report by Mr Lechner, which has the merit of clarifying the situation on succession law and thereby ensuring legal certainty. Indeed, European law is characterised by the combination of the laws of individual States, which creates inconsistent and difficult situations when it comes to recognising citizens’ rights. The creation of a European Certificate of Succession will act, on a cross-border basis, as proof of entries in registers and as a safeguard for persons acquiring succession property in good faith.</p>
      <p sl="it">For citizens habitually resident in their home country, if all their assets are there, nothing will change. Instead, the change affects those citizens who intend to reside, or are already resident, outside their home country: in this case, they will have the right to choose to adopt the law of their home country. Handling cross-border successions will therefore be made considerably easier and advisers on succession will also be given a secure basis on which to operate.</p>

      <p sl="fr">By adopting this report, we have just taken another step forwards in making our fellow citizens’ lives easier. In the framework of successions within the EU, we know there are judicial systems to settle successions, where it is compulsory to appear before a judge, and non-judicial systems, where the succession is settled by a notary. It was therefore important to achieve the principle of the movement of authentic instruments and thus for them to be recognised in another Member State, which has not been the case up to now. The adopted regulation also introduces a European Certificate of Succession (ECS) for use by heirs and legatees having direct rights in the succession, in order to demonstrate specific elements such as the status as heir or the attribution of a specific asset. Finally, we have managed to ensure that heirs who are citizens of a Member State that applies the reserved share mechanism, intended to protect a portion of the succession for the children of the deceased, can assert this in the case of international succession.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I supported this agreement at first reading because I think that EU citizens who choose to settle in another Member State greatly needed clearer rules on court competence, conflicts of law and implementation with regard to cross-border successions. The single market relates not only to companies which do business outside their national borders, but also to people who settle in other Member States and need to feel just as much protection as in their country of origin. At the moment, if someone is living in a Member State other than their country of origin and owns a property in that Member State which they want to leave as an inheritance, there is the danger of a conflict arising between the courts in the relevant Member States demanding jurisdiction. This situation may lead to cumbersome red tape for heirs or even to litigation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the European Certificate of Succession and the clarification that the competent court and applicable law are those in the last Member State where the person resided, except where it is specified in a will that the law of the Member State of origin should apply, will simplify the process considerably, while also maintaining the flexibility required.</p>

The aim of this regulation is to simplify the administrative steps for European citizens in matters of succession and to guarantee the rights of heirs and legatees. Within the European Union, there are judicial and non-judicial systems for settling successions. I welcome the retention of notaries’ competences. One paragraph lays down a universal competence for notaries, which will ensure that, when all the heirs agree to settle the succession amicably, the adjudicating judge will have to close proceedings so that the notary can settle the succession.</p>

      <p sl="pt">There are still many barriers which, directly or indirectly, continue to restrict the free movement of persons within the EU, as well as the public’s ability to fully enjoy the benefits of the single market. Cross-border obstacles to successions at European level affect around 50 million people – for example, citizens who live in a Member State other than their country of origin, who own property in a Member State other than that in which they reside, mixed couples, etc. – and also have a direct impact on their heirs.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This is the first time that an EU instrument is being adopted on succession rights, which is, by its very nature, a highly delicate area, intrinsically linked to the national arena. This is a very important and complex initiative that is of clear benefit to the public, and not just in terms of legal certainty, since it seeks to prevent fragmentation in terms of succession and contributes significantly to reducing bureaucracy and costs. It will enable free movement and recognition of succession rights, as well as the creation of a European Certificate of Succession; this will allow the public to check the status of their rights and exercise them throughout the EU.</p>

This contributes towards the recognition of documents on matters of succession and resolves a legal uncertainty by deciding the jurisdiction according to the principle of the ‘habitual residence’ of the deceased. Furthermore, I completely support the decision to allow the testator to choose otherwise by opting for the governing law of a State whose nationality he possesses instead of the one in which he is habitually resident. I would also like to emphasise that the introduction of the European Certificate of Succession helps simplify procedures in this area, since it offers sufficient proof of status as heir. Lastly, I think that this regulation fits, together with the Professional Qualifications Directive, into the wider context of reducing the barriers to free movement of persons within the European Union, and therefore helps to make the free movement of EU citizens a reality.</p>

The resolution that we have adopted today by a large majority stipulates that the applicable law shall be, by default, that of the country where the deceased was last habitually resident. However, it allows testators to choose between the law of the country of which they have nationality or that of the country where they reside for the settlement of their succession. In addition, the creation of a European Certificate of Succession will allow the quick and easy settlement of cross-border successions by making it possible for heirs to demonstrate their status and their rights in another Member State.

With the increasing globalisation of personal and family relationships, it is important to ensure legal certainty for the parties when a number of jurisdictions are involved. The purpose of this proposal is to create common rules regarding applicable law and succession to the estates of deceased persons.

      <p sl="sk">The EU has set itself the objective of developing and maintaining an area of freedom, security and justice. With the aim of progressively establishing this area, it must adopt measures in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters having a cross-border reach, to the extent necessary for the market to be able to function properly. In the European area of justice, citizens must be able to organise their succession in advance. The rights of heirs and legatees, other persons having a relationship with the deceased, and the creditors of the estate must be effectively guaranteed. The accelerated, accessible and effective organisation of successions with an international element in the European Union means that heirs, legatees, executor or administrator must be able to easily, out of court, prove their status in the Member States in which the inherited property is located. In order to facilitate the free movement of such proof in the EU, an appropriate regulation should introduce a single European certificate of inheritance and specify the issuing authority. I am of the opinion that, in order to comply with the principle of subsidiarity, however, this certificate should not replace the national procedures of Member States, but should, conversely, clarify the connection with these procedures.</p>

Yet it is not merely a legal problem: it is an issue that, unfortunately, has a major bearing on painful individual and family affairs of many European citizens who, when a relative passes away in a Member State other than their home country, must, on top of everything else, deal with complex legal problems that are too often afflicted with differences between the two countries’ legal systems.

      <p sl="pl">The increasing mobility of EU citizens means that they face great difficulties in asserting their succession rights abroad. The inheritance law of Members States is very diverse and related to local tradition, which means that cross-border proceedings are extremely complicated and confusing for the participants. The EU has 27 different legal succession systems and every year, around 450 000 international succession proceedings are opened. It is important to create a single transparent procedural system that helps Europeans to pursue their succession rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The report on a regulation creating common rules regarding matters of succession in the EU and the creation of a European Certificate of Succession is a very complex and ambitious project. This will not affect national rules, but will make it easier for people who own property in more than one Member State. Statistics show that around 1.5% of residents in EU Member States are citizens of other countries in the Community; they will be able to decide, based on the new provisions, in which country the future administration of their estate should take place. Furthermore, the introduction of a European Certificate of Succession, which will constitute evidence of the status of heir, recognised in the territory of all the Member States, will make it easier for holders of such a certificate to exercise their rights, resulting in shorter and less costly proceedings.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I supported the Lechner report, which is a real step forward for the European Union with regard to succession. Having been the subject of a compromise, the Lechner report advocates the principles of the circulation of authentic instruments and the protection of the reserved share. Moreover, it allows for the creation of a European Certificate of Succession for use by heirs and legatees having direct rights in the succession. Finally, in order to safeguard notaries’ competences, the report expressly provides for their universal competence.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The underlying principle of the proposal for a regulation is to eliminate all obstacles to the free movement of persons and their rights deriving from the particular variations in succession regimes in Member States. The proposed regulations aim to increase legal certainty for both testators and beneficiaries. The essence of the regulation is to implement the model of a uniform status for an estate where, in relation to one estate, regardless of the nature of its contents or the location thereof, the provisions of one legal regime apply, this having been selected by the testator as the applicable law. This avoids fragmentation of the estate and reduces problems in exercising successor rights under different legal regulations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, we must consider whether the proposal fully realises the intended possibility of protecting the estate upon death. There is no doubt that the possibility of selecting the applicable law to resolve matters of succession in conjunction with the European Certificate of Succession allows for such protection. However, this is a formal aspect of this regulation, consisting of its introduction into the legal system. It has great potential. However, it depends on the material aspect of the actual opportunity for entitled persons to benefit from these institutions. We need to consider how to encourage the behaviour described by us in these provisions. This is the whole problem with the draft regulation. In addition to creating legal tools, we need to persuade entitled persons to use them.</p>

I voted in favour of this text, which aims to prevent legal battles in the case of successions where the laws of several countries could apply. Thanks to this regulation, citizens will be able to decide, in accordance with specific criteria, which EU Member State’s law they wish to apply to their succession.

It had become necessary to adapt to the changes in society, in this instance, the constant rise in mixed marriages within the European Union and the legal problems that this can cause. This report therefore advocates the creation of a European Certificate of Succession in order to simplify notarial procedures with regard to cross-border successions. In this way, it will be easier for heirs to assert their status as heir in a cross-border context.

      <p sl="pt">The Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. For the gradual establishment of such an area, the Union is to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, particularly when necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market. The proper functioning of the internal market should be facilitated by removing the obstacles to the free movement of persons who currently face difficulties asserting their rights in the context of a succession having cross-border implications. In the European area of justice, citizens must be able to organise their succession in advance. The rights of heirs and legatees, of other persons close to the deceased, and of creditors of the succession, must be effectively guaranteed. In order to achieve those objectives, this regulation should bring together provisions on jurisdiction, on applicable law, on recognition or, as the case may be, acceptance, enforceability and enforcement of decisions, authentic instruments and court settlements and on the European Certificate of Succession.

The creation of a European Certificate of Succession should lead to greater legal certainty for people when writing their wills. It is a pity that Ireland and the UK will not be opting in at this stage.

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this report, which puts the need to protect the reserved share of the estate at the centre of the debate. In order to allow cases of international succession to be settled quickly, the regulation introduces a European certificate. This certificate is for use by heirs and legatees having direct rights in the succession in order to demonstrate specific elements, such as their status as heirs or the attribution of a specific asset. Uniform connecting factors for determining court competence and applicable law are the nub of a European solution. Deceased persons who had been habitually resident outside their home country and who had not made a choice of law would be subject to the law on succession of the country of residence. That would be new for all Member States. The European Certificate of Succession should be restricted to cross-border matters. Any entity dealing with an estate – courts, authorities, notaries, etc. – should be competent to issue it.</p>

Therefore, it is extremely important that the European Parliament and the Council are working towards finding a fair agreement that can be inclusive of all the different sensibilities and legal traditions in the Union.

This corresponding regulation, however, now makes it possible to choose between the laws of the home country and the country of permanent residence in cross-border inheritance matters, and that will make trans-European criteria clearer as regards the decision of which Member State’s laws will be implemented if the estate is subject to the laws of more than one Member State.

The new European rules would also introduce a European Certificate of Succession. This could ease legal procedures and ensure that the rights of heirs are respected alongside those of the other parties involved, such as creditors. Overall, this would making the procedure quicker and clearer, while use of the certificate would be voluntary.

I am pleased that we had the opportunity today to vote on a topic that had been anticipated by citizens for a very long time. Living in the border town of Sopron, I am acutely aware of the administrative difficulties and barriers to the assertion of rights that citizens have to face more often than not in cross-border affairs. This, unfortunately, leads to diminished legal certainty, which is, however, an exceptionally important factor in respect of succession. I supported this report because with its adoption, the administration of cross-border succession cases will be significantly simplified, giving citizens a secure, predictable basis for disposing of their inheritance, thereby allowing them to save considerable amounts of time, energy and money. Although the report has not been in the spotlight of the international media, I do believe that it is votes such as this that truly show the worth of our work. The very reason for our being here as Members of the European Parliament is to discuss matters such as this and to represent the true interests of European citizens.

In order to achieve a cross-cutting solution for all the Member States, it is crucial to lay down a single set of reference criteria for succession rights, specifically regarding the handover, administration and liquidation of the legitimate owner’s goods. I am voting for the submitted proposal, which guarantees increased legal certainty for citizens resident in the European Union, since the criterion of habitual residence will now be in force for the competent court to apply its own legal system. Finally, it is important to stress that no changes will be made to the normal succession process for citizens habitually resident in their country of origin who own property in that country. Property that citizens own outside their country of origin will also be covered by the legal system of their country of residence.</p>

The number of EU-27 citizens who are resident in a different Member State to their Member State of origin reached approximately 12.3 million in 2010, marking a rise of 3 million compared with 2005. In order to settle successions in the EU involving any cross-border aspect in a quick, easy and effective manner, heirs, legatees, executors of a will or administrators of an estate should be able to demonstrate easily their status and/or rights and powers in another Member State, for instance, in a Member State where the succession property is located. Therefore, the regulation envisages the creation of a standard certificate, the European Certificate of Succession, which will be issued for use in another Member State.

Sensitive issues of today’s society are reflected and incorporated in the report: implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, abortion, the gender pay gap, the role of women in decision making and the use of quotas in company boards or in politics, and maternity leave.

      <p sl="ro">It is not possible to fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy on creating an open, inclusive society, capable of providing considerable resources supporting the European Union’s sustainable development in the medium and long term, without adopting a resolute approach to tackling a number of problems which Member States’ societies are facing in terms of gender equality. In these circumstances, it is important for Member States to adopt legislative measures aimed at providing equal, effective economic independence for men and women in Europe’s societies. One issue directly linked to this objective is that of equal pay for men and women. In the absence of sustained efforts, the 17.5% gap between the incomes earned by men and women cannot be reduced.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Resolving the issue of gender disparity in decision making is just as important to the successful achievement of the European Union’s medium- and long-term objectives. At a time when 60% of higher education graduates are women, the fact that just 12% of members of the executive boards of the large listed corporations and only 3% of managing directors of large European companies are women provides further evidence of the systemic problems we are facing.

      <p sl="en">I voted for this resolution because, although equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union, there is still huge gender discrimination in the labour sector. This situation, in 2012, is unacceptable. Women across the EU earn 17.5% less on average than men. I would like to underline that women represent 60% of new university graduates but continue to be under-represented in economic decision-making posts. Indeed, within the EU, on average, only 12% of the executives of the major listed companies are women, with only 3% female chairs. In times of economic crisis, strengthening women’s position in the job market is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. For this reason, Member States must invest in affordable, high-quality facilities for the care of children, the elderly and other dependent persons, making sure that as many people as possible can combine professional and private life. I also would like to express my great concern about the legislation in some Member States which does not expressly forbid the handing of pre-signed resignation letters to employers when women are recruited, which has the effect of enabling maternity laws to be circumvented. Any further delay in that prohibition is intolerable.</p>

It should be pointed out that the European Union does not have the power to amend the family law of the Member States.

      <p sl="fr">In the yearly speeches on 8 March, everybody speaks in favour of equality between men and women, yet, in actual fact, this is a more delicate matter and attitudes are only slowly evolving. Discrimination against women persists, whether in terms of pay, the participation of women in decision making or their representation in politics. While supporting the action by Commissioner Reding, who has recently launched a consultation regarding the measures to be adopted in order to reinforce gender equality, the in ’t Veld report, which I fully endorse, seeks to go further and calls on the European Commission to propose legislation on the introduction of quotas for the executive bodies of companies in order to improve women’s representation. Quotas are never a panacea. Nevertheless, if used on a provisional basis, they can be precious tools for doing away with relics from a bygone era. Today, only 13.7% of women sit on the executive boards of listed companies in the EU. That is clearly not enough. Despite European conservative opposition, Parliament has demonstrated that it is, and will remain, fundamentally progressive on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this European Parliament report because equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union, enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. Despite the gradual progress in the area of gender equality, many inequalities between women and men still remain. Despite countless campaigns, targets and measures in recent years for equal pay, for equal work and work of equal value, the gender pay gap remains stubbornly wide. On average, women across the EU earn 17.5% less than men and there has only been a marginal reduction of the gender pay gap in the last few years. The Member States must therefore redouble their efforts to implement existing EU provisions with the aim of closing this gap. Violence against women still remains one of society’s most sensitive and severe problems. Therefore, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to present as a matter of urgency an EU-wide strategy to end violence against women, including a legislative criminal law instrument to combat gender-based violence as requested by Parliament in several resolutions. The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to establish 2015 as the EU Year to End Violence against Women.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the European Union. It is guaranteed by a range of legal regulations aimed at ensuring equal levels of employment, wages and working hours, which, unfortunately, are not always observed in practice. Traditional social divisions between women and men which are deeply rooted in societies contribute to this, and they can be changed gradually – through media campaigns focusing on gender equality, for example. Discrimination against women in terms of payment for the same work is particularly striking, and it should be noted that it is harder for women to achieve a balance between work and family life. A fair policy of equality between women and men should be of fundamental importance not only socially, but also in terms of the economy, since it leads to the expanded production capacity of the relevant sector of the economy, and thus to an increase in the level of employment and greater competition in the labour market.</p>

The report on gender equality in the EU, drawn up by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, strongly advocates a continuation of the intensive fight to eliminate these inequalities and supports a strengthening of the position of women in European society. In addition to this, it also calls for protection of the rights of people living in same-sex relationships, and for the promotion of equality and protection of the rights and dignity of women living beyond the borders of the EU, particularly in Muslim countries.

It calls for equal representation of women in social, economic and political life and proposes important improvements. Specific binding measures are proposed in order to protect and promote women’s rights, such as pension rights, maternity and paternity leave, access to health based on the gender aspect, protection from all forms of violence and equality in pay, political representation and promotion to positions of political and economic responsibility. One basic point in the report is the reference to women’s rights regardless of their social status, age, sexual orientation or ethnicity. The Commission is also called on to implement its commitment to mainstream gender equality into the Common European Asylum System. Finally, it quite rightly notes that families are diverse and comprise married, unmarried and partnered parents, different-sex and same-sex parents, single parents and foster parents, who deserve protection.</p>

The Commission has made countless proposals for combating this inequality – in particular, the Europe 2020 strategy – but progress has been too slow, unfortunately. It is even clearer at a time of economic crisis that improving the position of women in the labour market and making them more economically independent is an economic necessity, apart from being a moral imperative. Currently, 60% of new graduates are women. However, it is very difficult for them to enter professional life at their level of training and there is a wage gap that must be reduced: on average, women earn 17.5% less than men. It is also crucial to step up measures enabling the reconciliation of professional and family lives. Particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of women, who are at greater risk of social exclusion, poverty and extreme human rights violations. I call on the Member States and all stakeholders not to limit themselves to advocating the use of words to achieve gender equality, but to make all necessary efforts and take all necessary action to prioritise it in both their social and their economic strategies.</p>

I voted against the report, however, as I regret the fact that it has, to a certain extent, been hijacked by family policy, which does not belong at EU level. We must show respect for different cultures, traditions and religions. Issues such as parental leave, budgetary measures and political priorities in respect of equality issues should be left to the Member States to decide at national level. What we can and should do instead is increase our commitment to enabling the increased participation of women, but creating legislation on quotas at EU level is not the way forward.

The impact of the necessary fiscal consolidation must not fall disproportionately on the shoulders of women. There have to be clear gender dimensions to our growth and jobs strategies. I endorse the call for a European equal pay target of reducing the gender pay gap by 10% in each Member State. Gender pay differentials for work of equal value are transmitted into later generations in the form of lower pensions for women and higher poverty rates amongst older women. They need to be tackled now. I welcome the call for EU legislation, including quotas, to increase female representation on company boards to 30% by 2015 and 40% by 2020 and for legislative measures at national level to ensure balanced representation of women and men in politics.

      <p sl="ro">Although an extensive theoretical framework has been established providing guidelines for eliminating all forms of discrimination against women, inequalities remain in every area of activity. In the current financial and economic climate, strengthening the position of women in the labour market is not only an ongoing moral argument but also an economic necessity. There is the ever-growing risk of poverty and social exclusion, while the austerity measures adopted by some Member States in recent years have been imposed on top of the harsh reality of a lack of support mechanisms for women, in a climate of discrimination on the labour market and in society. Measures for supporting families and children have been abolished or reduced at a time when the health care and pre-school education systems are experiencing difficulties and there is a lack of utilities and medical care in rural areas, which has resulted in a sharp decline in the living standards of families with children.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, salaries have been cut in budget sectors in which women predominantly work, such as education and health, which has led to a substantial drop in incomes.

However, this should be achieved by removing the barriers that still remain for women – such as, for example, the negative impact of motherhood on career progression – and not imposed through regulation and quotas. As I have had occasion to say numerous times, unless they are temporary, quotas only diminish women rather than guaranteeing them equal access to a profession, to public office, or to management and leadership roles in business. Moreover, in the field of private enterprise, the imposition of quotas could constitute an intervention limiting shareholder freedom and could, as such, be in breach of Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which sets out the principle of freedom to conduct a business.

The role of women in so-called modern societies has, in recent decades, been increasingly valued owing, in large measure, to the greater open-mindedness of communities in the countries of northern Europe. On their own merit, women have gone from a position of subservience to and dependence on men, due to their dual position of mother and housewife, to a position of equality cemented by their emancipation, education and professional training. The principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ is not respected in all fields of work.

      <p sl="pt">The report highlights some of the main reasons for discrimination between men and women, which are directly related to their economic and work situation. Choosing to do this denotes the correct approach, which we view positively. The report proposes positive measures that promote economic equality and equality in working conditions between men and women. However, the European Union’s present political and social situation is an unavoidable aspect of this debate. If the so-called austerity measures advocated by the European institutions – the majority in this Parliament, in particular – are continued and enshrined in the treaties, as intended, they will lead to enormous steps backwards in terms of equality between men and women: the even further weakening of labour relations, with the watering down of the principle of collective bargaining; higher rates of unemployment; increasingly precarious jobs, which particularly affects women already; and a reduction in the public child care network, which is essential to alleviating the excessive burden that falls on women.

      <p sl="sk">The EU is an important player in the fight for gender equality and against discrimination. Despite making every effort, gender equality has not yet been achieved in the EU. Legislation may have changed, but the traditional gender roles and gender stereotypes remain a significant obstacle to fundamental change. Economic independence for women and men is key to achieving gender equality. There is a risk that the current economic crisis will set us back a few years, since it ultimately affects women more than men.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I therefore consider that efforts to improve labour market participation and access to leading positions in, say, company boardrooms must remain a high priority on the political agenda. The difference in the status of men and women in some countries outside Europe is often dramatic. Women have fewer rights, or even no rights whatsoever. The EU and Member States must do much more to bring about an improvement and to rectify this situation. What is needed is not only sufficient financial resources, but also, I firmly believe, a radical change in mentality and traditions in particular.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted against a number of clauses of the in ’t Veld report on ‘Equality between women and men in the European Union – 2011’, especially those relating to abortion, which, in my opinion, fail to recognise that this is an issue of national competence. I also abstained on a number of paragraphs which, in my opinion, were ambiguous. Having said that, however, the report highlights a number of issues and concerns, especially those relating to barriers that prevent gender equality. One example is the employment rate of women, which remains far lower than that of men; another is unequal pay for equal work. The report also contains essential clauses which focus on dignity and integrity, as well as an end to gender-based violence. In this respect therefore, and considering the abovementioned reasons, I decided to vote in favour of the final text of the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Every year, the European Commission publishes a report on the state of gender equality in Europe. Unfortunately, the same findings recur every year: gender stereotyping, ancestral taboos and an outdated view of the division of roles between women and men persist, preventing any improvement in the circumstances of women in the European Union. In 2011, the crisis helped make the situation worse, since, in affecting women more severely than men, it undermined their economic independence. Employment, access to positions of political and economic responsibility, freedom and sexual health: all issues that still require a continuous struggle in order to achieve genuine gender equality. This also has to be a daily struggle, in everyday life as well as in the European Parliament, where, at every opportunity, almost one third of Members regrettably call into question the issue of access to contraception and abortion.</p>

I also voted in favour of this report, which calls for the introduction of quotas in the decision-making bodies of companies in order to improve women’s representation. I repeat that quotas should not be the only response and systematic tool for fighting against discrimination. However, at the present time, this is the most efficient way of rebalancing the situation, as there are still too many anachronisms and barriers in our society.</p>

The business sector itself has to decide what is best for it, and it is not for us to set compulsory measures.

      <p sl="fi">I voted in favour of the report by Ms in ’t Veld. Although the European Union leads the world in the area of gender equality, we have to bear in mind that there is still room for improvement. It is indisputable that women are under-represented in leading positions throughout Europe. It is essential to put this right.</p>
      <p sl="fi">As to the options available to us, we must be able to practise open assessment. There are huge differences between the Member States with regard to the position of women, so we firstly need to ensure that measures found to be positive and workable in the more advanced Member States are implemented across the Union. The impact of gender-linked factors in particular on a person’s career opportunities, such as starting a family or doing military service, must be taken into consideration.</p>
      <p sl="fi">It is nevertheless worrying that, even in countries which are very equal statistically or with respect to their legislation, there are obvious gender disparities in the number of those selected for positions, and particularly for managerial posts. The reasons for this need to be assessed. Without underrating the effect of the distortion caused by the ‘old boy’ networks, it is clear that an examination of the figures shows that we cannot just take into account those selected as managers compared to the entire population base: we also have to be able to see any gender disparities that might exist between those selected and numbers of applicants, and between numbers of applicants and the population base, and then arrive at the relevant conclusions. No quotas can provide any real solution, which is to say that selection of the most suitable candidates regardless of gender is the correct approach, as long as there continues to be a considerable difference between the sexes in their appetite for risk. That is why it is essential that both sexes, while still young, are also shown the importance of taking the initiative if they are to succeed in modern society. In the end, if you want something, you have to go out and get it.</p>

We know that it is an ambitious target, but we have to do everything we can to reach it. Much remains to be done in terms of gender equality, especially in terms of employment, by trying to reduce the difficulties that women have in finding work and career opportunities.

In areas such as the economy and politics, men still hold the highest positions. It should therefore be stressed that equality between women and men is very important in order to achieve sustainable economic growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion. I would like to express my support for the reduction of gender-based wage differences, for an increase in the role of women in decision-making processes at all levels, and for the fight against gender-based discrimination and violence.

I am not suggesting a ban on two people of the same sex living freely together, but the family is something else altogether and it must therefore have different guarantees and protective measures. The meaning of the terms ‘family’ and ‘parenthood’ derive from the very concept of humanity: indeed, only a union between a man and a women can lead to the conception of a new life and the continuance of the human race. We do not want to give in to these new ideas, which have sprung from nothing in recent years: human history and human nature cannot and must not be altered.

However, an opportunity has once again been missed. The true meaning of this resolution has instead been twisted into a demagogic wasteland in an attempt to make everyone happy, while actually not pleasing anyone, and going so far as to even deal with the adoption of children by same-sex couples, while lamenting the definition of the family and parenthood as ‘too restrictive’ in some Member States.

In order to ensure women’s active participation and full involvement in social life, politics and the labour market, bolder and more binding methods must be implemented than those that have been implemented hitherto. Before the implementation of such methods (for instance, election quotas, quotas regarding the representation of women on the boards of large publicly traded companies, etc.), however, a better overview must be obtained of the degree to which women are represented in different types of companies and of the voluntary or compulsory measures that have already been implemented. In addition to the gathering and presentation of such data, I consider that we should demand an analysis in all Member States of wages earned for equal or equivalent work (in addition to a comparison of average wages), for which purpose guidelines for the evaluation of equal or equivalent work must also be prepared.</p>

The Member States should, as a matter of urgency, draw up legislative plans for the regulation of maternity and paternity leave in order to respond to the needs of European families and the European economy.

      <p sl="lt">I supported this report because equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union, but many women still face discrimination, poverty and stereotypes in everyday situations. As the rapporteur pointed out, in the EU Member States, on average, only 12% of the executives of major listed companies are women, with only 3% female chairs. Furthermore, women earn 17%, and in Lithuania 19%, less than men for the same work. As mentioned in the debates, more progress has been made where the Member States have set quotas and other legally binding measures, and there is a much greater guarantee of gender equality. It is therefore essential to take action at both national and European level so that women have greater opportunities to participate in decision making in the public and private sectors and we need to improve the position of women in the labour market and increase their economic independence to reach a 75% employment rate for men and women in the EU by 2020.

Whilst there is no shortage of goodwill, mentalities have changed little and the ‘glass ceiling’ is as tough as ever.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I strongly support two of the published priorities. The first aims at ending violence against women. Its everyday occurrence in all forms (physical, sexual, mental or economic) is worrying. In Belgium, domestic violence is the number one cause of death amongst women aged 15 to 44. The other priority concerns the objective of equal pay for women and men for the same work and the same qualifications. There is no justification for women earning 17.5% less, on average, than their male counterparts.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would also like to mention the policy on quotas advanced in the report. Even applied in small doses to corporate management bodies, I do not think that offsetting de facto inequality with legal inequality would be the right solution and one that would lead to a real change in mentalities. After all, this is the objective that we are striving to achieve.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European Union has been an important player in fighting for gender equality anti-discrimination. However, in spite of the best efforts, gender equality in the EU is far from being achieved. Legislation may have changed, but traditional gender roles, gender stereotyping and taboos remain an important obstacle to fundamental change. The economic independence of men and women is key to gender equality. The current economic crisis risks putting us back years, as it may ultimately hit women harder than men. So, efforts to improve labour market participation, and access to positions of power such as company boards, need to stay high on the agenda. The gap between the position and status of women and men in some countries outside Europe is often dramatic. Women have fewer rights or no rights at all. The EU and its Member States need to do much more to improve the situation of these women, starting with their health. It is not only sufficient funds that are needed, but also a radical change in mentality and tradition.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am strongly opposed to the report. Instead of putting forward initiatives so that effective equality between men and women can be achieved democratically at work, in politics, in decision making and in terms of salaries, it sets out to bring in recognition of same-sex families and delves once again into the issue of the ‘necessity’ of abortion.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another thing that confirms still further my choice to vote against the report is that it aims to guarantee the reproductive rights of women, regardless of their sexual orientation. This would mean that men who feel like women would be given the chance to have children or even adopt them. The report also contemplates the idea that families do not only include married parents, but also same-sex parents, thereby allowing same-sex couples to adopt children. A report that could have garnered comprehensive support for the rightful recognition of women’s rights has been transformed into a nonsensical series of statements about the presumed rights of so-called same-sex families who want the option to adopt children. I think that the family – in the strict sense of the word – can only be considered as such when it comprises a man and a women and any children they may have.</p>

Yet, in practice, it is far from recognition: the pay gap remains, with women earning just under 20% less than men on average, they are under-represented in economic and political decision making, and still vulnerable to physical violence and verbal abuse. I voted in favour of this report as it highlights the areas in which the Member States still have to make progress, puts forwards tangible proposals and also considers the position of women outside of the European Union by advocating greater international cooperation. Gender equality should no longer be considered as a stand-alone policy, but should be fully integrated across all policy areas in order to produce tangible effects.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Equality between men and women is not only a democratic imperative and a boost for the necessary fight against all forms of discrimination, but also an economic necessity and a social requirement. Thus, I support the measures contained in this resolution, notably relating to the adoption of new laws, if the Member States do not honour their commitments in terms of imposing quotas to consolidate female representation in corporate management bodies, with the aim of increasing this representation to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020.</p>

Only 12% of executives of major listed companies are women. These are problems which, if necessary, must be addressed through legislation and quotas. Targets and quotas should, however, respect the specificities of each country accordingly.

Such an interpretation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights clearly shows that our concerns about the role that the Charter would play were entirely justified. The Left still fails to understand that the Member States never granted the European Union the authority to deal with abortion.

I voted for Amendment 28 because I think that the definition of ‘family’ is a matter of subsidiarity. I voted for the call to Member States to use Structural Funds for the period 2007-2013 to develop child care services to enable both women and men to combine their professional and private lives. Given that women across the EU earn, on average, 17.5% less than men, we have called on Member States to redouble their efforts to implement the European measures with the aim of closing this gap. I voted for the call made to European institutions, Member States and social partners to devise a strategy for tackling the persistent gender pay gap.

For example, there is specific mention of the fact that it is regrettable that many Member States provide support for families. In my opinion, supporting families is a fundamental political issue which I do not want to disappear. Incorporating political mistakes into the fabric of society, as the rapporteur suggests, will not make these mistakes any better.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Gender equality is far from being achieved in either Lithuania or the EU. The report states that although legislation has been changed, traditional gender stereotypes remain a serious barrier to fundamental change. The gender pay gap can be seen very clearly in Lithuania. The gender pay gap in Lithuania is over 21% – one of the highest rates in the EU, which has increased by 5% over the last six years. Consequently, the gender pay gap may reach 25% in a few years, unless appropriate measures are taken. The gender pay gap is more visible in the private sector where women are paid less than men for doing the same job. A report published by the Institute for the Study of Labour states that in the EU, the gender pay gap problem is not just a glass ceiling issue but also a sticky floor problem. For example, the gender pay gap is greater both among the highest earners and the lowest paid in Lithuania. In order to improve the situation, there should be more transparent pay scales in companies and more severe measures against companies that fail to comply with the principle of gender equality. Faced with the crisis, there should be an even greater focus on economic equality. Lower wages for women inevitably mean not just lower incomes, but lower pensions.</p>

The European Parliament itself must also be reformed since, given that only 35% of its Members are female, it still has a long way to go before equality is achieved. The Pietikäinen report, which I voted in favour of, calls for the introduction of a quota system for candidate lists for party bodies and elections. It is time for the political parties to accept their responsibilities and to recognise the extent of their role as key actors in the promotion of parity. Nevertheless, regardless of what national situations may be, the Member States should consider introducing legislative measures, such as positive action measures, as well as also implementing effective sanctions. At the same time, the media and education also have an important role to play as it falls to them to make a change by promoting efforts to eliminate stereotypes and encourage the portrayal of positive images of women in managerial positions and by running awareness-raising campaigns.</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission to look into the fact that these percentages appear to be static and that no improvements are being seen. This phenomenon could be explained by the traditional barriers that women face, such as the lack of financial resources, stereotypes, and difficulties in managing family and political life. I therefore support one of the measures put forward by the rapporteur, which involves designing and implementing effective strategies at EU and national level for increasing women’s engagement and participation in decision making and leadership, through quantified targets, regular monitoring mechanisms and clear action plans. I also think that active and tangible measures should be promoted in order to ensure gender balance in all governing bodies and public appointments.

The European Parliament therefore invites the Council, the Commission and the Member States to draw up and implement effective gender equality policies and multifaceted strategies for achieving parity in participation in political decision making and leadership at all levels. Moreover, the Council, the Commission and the Member States should enforce parity at all levels by sending clear anti-discrimination messages, by providing appropriate resources, by using specific tools, and by promoting necessary training for civil servants responsible for preparing budgets in gender budgeting. In its report, the European Parliament also calls on the Council, Commission and Member States to enable women and men to take an active part in political decision making by promoting reconciliation and a balance between family life and working life by means of measures such as sharing the costs of parenthood equally between both parents’ employers and ensuring accessible and adequate care services for children and the elderly, for instance.</p>

I appreciate that this report calls on political parties in the Member States to adopt measures for the greater participation of women in politics, but I do not agree with the call to establish quotas. On the contrary, I am a supporter of looser forms of regulation in the form of targets and more general rules for determining the ordering of candidate lists for national elections and elections at EU level. One possible incentive might be an obligation for parties to fulfil certain targets in the area of equal representation as a precondition for the granting of funds to the party.

This report emphasises traditional obstacles to women accessing public posts, such as financial difficulties, a predominantly male culture, reconciling family and political life, and the stereotypes that still predominate in the media. As such, there is a need for concrete and structural measures to make the political participation of women a clear reality, particularly through a commitment to training, guaranteed equality of opportunity in accessing campaigns and presenting a positive image of women as leaders. The political parties also have a crucial role to play in combating the under-representation of women in political decision-making assemblies across the EU Member States. I am therefore voting for this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the great majority of Member States, women are still under-represented in the public and political decision-making processes, especially in the most senior positions. This is all the more significant when we consider that women account for almost 50% of the workforce and that more than 50% of recent graduates are women. This inequality casts a shadow over the majority of Member States, as well as at European level. In this Parliament, 35% of Members are women, whilst one third of the Commissioners are female. These are positive signs that need urgent encouragement to become more widespread. The persistent under-representation of women constitutes a democratic deficit, with the end result being that the legitimacy of decision making at national and EU level is weakened. I am therefore voting for this report, which seeks to encourage the setting out of strategies and the adoption of concrete measures to promote the balanced representation of women at all levels of political and public decision making. I have serious doubts that the quota system is the best solution, so I am abstaining on the related items.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I voted against the report because I do not believe that quota systems are the solution to the equality problem. It is important that we commit ourselves to strengthening the position of women, but women must progress on the basis of their competence and skills and by means of a change in social attitudes. It is by educating our children and young people that we can change the view of the role of women in the long term and overcome stereotypes. Men and women must have the same opportunities when it comes to political decision making, and appointments must be made on the basis of merit, not gender. Quota systems and dictating from above will not resolve the imbalance. The way to make progress must instead be based on freedom of choice. Financial independence is the way to equality. For example, we must make it easier for women to become entrepreneurs and create the conditions for women to have the courage to start their own business.</p>

      <p sl="ro">A set of data published by Eurostat in connection with International Women’s Day highlights the fact that in the European Union, women are much more vulnerable to the risk of poverty and social exclusion than men, and the most severe cases of this are encountered in Romania and Bulgaria.

Women are noticeably under-represented in political positions across the whole European Union, and the lack of parity is prevalent in every sector of activity. The active involvement of women is an economic necessity in the current climate. This is why it is vital to create mechanisms for implementing gender policies aimed at achieving parity with regard to involvement in the political decision-making process, thereby ensuring that these measures are effective.</p>

The proportion of women involved in political decisions has not changed in recent years and, in some decision-making bodies, has even gone down. The report therefore calls on national governments, after the 2014 European elections, to simultaneously put forward a man and a woman as their candidates for the office of European Commissioner.

I also recall Simone Veil, the first woman President of this House. In view of this, I do not believe that strict quotas guarantee women equal access to a profession, to political office, or to management and leadership roles in business. It is more important to guarantee women equal resources and opportunities.

The less developed a society is, the worse the situation of women regarding respect for their rights. Even in societies where their emancipation has earned them citizenship rights, gender equality continues to be an illusion. While there are areas, such as education, health care and social work, in which women are, little by little, rivalling or exceeding the number of men, there are others, like politics, where their involvement is increasing only timidly and through imposing legislation. While use of a quota system could jeopardise selection based on the principle of merit, it has nevertheless contributed to this increase. Despite the progress that has been made in recent times and the support policies implemented in the EU, much remains to be done. Across the EU countries, only 5% of the members of the various parliaments and 10% of ministers are women.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report starts by noting a fact: women are under-represented in elected and appointed posts in bodies under national sovereignty and in the European Parliament itself, as well as in what it calls the ‘top jobs’ in general. In order to solve this problem, it advocates using legal means to impose quota systems promoting parity in these areas. The approach followed by the rapporteur is reductionist and shorn of aspects critical, firstly, to a proper understanding of the problem and, secondly, to its fair solution. The civic and political participation of women in various areas – associations, trades unions, culture, inter alia – is made more difficult by limitations in terms of accessing education, culture and public services that result from economic difficulties caused, to begin with, by the wage inequalities of which they are victims and by the precariousness of their jobs. These are the issues underlying gender discrimination, which cannot be ignored and which limit the social, political and cultural involvement of women. It is these structural problems, which are expressions of class inequalities, that need to be combated. The solution cannot simply involve establishing artificial, formal and administrative equality, whilst forgetting the real problems of the overwhelming majority of women and keeping them off limits. We also reject any interference in the internal affairs of parties.</p>

      <p sl="sk">At the level of the European Union and its Member States, there is an imbalance in the participation of women and men in political and public decision making, and women are clearly under-represented in elected and appointed political positions. Equal representation of women and men in the political decision-making process is a question of human rights and social justice, and a vital requirement for the functioning of a democratic society. The persistent under-representation of women is a democratic deficit that undermines the legitimacy of decision making at EU and national level.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I consider it important and justified to establish a favourable environment for women to participate in political life at all levels. At EU level, the harmonisation of professional, private and family life is recognised as an important priority in order to achieve gender equality, and women should be given the opportunity to participate in political life.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It is important to bring about the participation of women from different backgrounds in decision-making positions. Promoting gender-balanced representation in policy making in external relations, the fight against the marginalisation of women in political life – I firmly believe that these should be the aspects that must be taken into account in EU external relations, and that the appropriate financial and technical assistance should be provided.</p>

Simply by way of example, women are still under-represented in political decision-making assemblies across the European Member States, accounting for just 24% of members in national parliaments with varying – but all equally disheartening – percentages in the Member States. Even though theoretical equality has already been achieved in our legal systems, there are still many insidious cultural and practical barriers that too often prevent women from realistically aspiring to the positions of responsibility held by men. What goes in politics applies equally to the public administration, private business, teaching and the armed forces, and in all walks of society that involve a measure of responsibility and prestige. In a highly competitive global context like today’s, it is no longer acceptable that gender discrimination can have such a profound effect not only on professional prospects but also on the dignity of all women.</p>

A few years ago, their party was not gentle with their official (female) candidate for the presidential election.

In this respect, measures have already been adopted in some Member States, but there is a considerable imbalance on the whole. I feel that electoral systems which take into account gender equality are a positive development, and I think that the actions in favour of this should be continued. I support the stance that specific measures need to be implemented to achieve equality when it comes to elected offices in national parliaments and the European Parliament because the level of representation of women in these bodies is currently less than a quarter for the EU. The same problem also applies with regard to gender equality in the executive of Member States and the European Commission.

The European Parliament, where 35% of the Members are women, stands out in this respect, but it is still a long way from achieving a genuine balance. Equality in society must be preceded by equality in politics and vice versa . The female members of the population must feel that they are adequately represented in the field of politics, which is why I strongly support the call for genuine equality of the sexes in political decision-making positions.

      <p sl="en">Women are still under-represented and constitute only 24% of the members in the national parliaments, 31% at regional level and 35% at European level. The Nordic countries have the highest level of elected women in the national parliaments in the EU, 42%. The rapporteur underlines the fact that the percentages are stagnating and that no positive trend can be noticed. Member States should consider introducing legislative measures such as positive actions to achieve parity between sexes, the voted report says. National parties should implement quota systems in those electoral systems where applicable and apply rank ordering rules to electoral candidate lists for regional, national and EU elections. The best way of improving women’s participation in politics is to have women candidates alternating with men at the top of electoral lists. I disagree with that because I believe that the most important thing in politics is the personal qualities of the candidates. Gender is not related to personal qualities.</p>

      <p sl="de">This report, which aims to increase the proportion of women taking part in decision-making processes, is, unfortunately, a complete failure. Instead of carrying out an objective analysis of the situation and proposing sensible, practical measures, it has deteriorated into a left-wing feminist tract. In addition to completely disregarding the subsidiarity of the Member States’ authority, it calls for mandatory quotas for women in management positions (boards of directors, supervisory boards, etc.). This type of measure is otherwise only familiar to us in the context of communist dictatorships and it contradicts the principle of private autonomy. Companies and other organisations, including public bodies and political parties, must be free to choose the person they appoint to a particular position. The decision should be made primarily on the basis of qualifications and not gender. Quotas for lists of candidates for European, national and regional elections are not practical because some Member States do not use the system of proportional representation, and they also make no sense. We must not restrict the freedom of voters to make their own decisions. They can use a preferential vote, for example, to choose the candidate they want. In addition, the various parties have different structures. A party with a majority of female members will nominate more women and vice versa . Finally, it is clear that the principle of supply and demand produces good results in this area, while mandatory measures dictated by the EU do not. This is why I have voted against the report.</p>

      <p sl="it">There are rather a lot of examples of women in politics who reached the upper echelons of power through merit.

However, we will not solve the problem with quotas that are introduced artificially. I believe that the attempt to establish quotas for elected political posts is contrary to the spirit of democratic elections. The Member States should therefore decide freely for themselves whether the introduction of such quotas should be considered and would be beneficial. In Lithuania, the country I represent, there is still a lot to be done in terms of improving women’s involvement, and reducing labour market segregation and the gender pay gap. However, there are areas where Lithuania exceeds the EU average, such as the number of women on the boards of major companies. In terms of the highest political posts, in Lithuania, women head two of the three branches of government – we have a female President and Speaker of the Seimas . In the Lithuanian Government, women are in charge of finance and defence. There needs to be more attention to gender equality aspects in the middle of the decision-making chain.</p>

      <p sl="it">Today, we have finally tackled an issue that posits the central role of women in a context which, for too long, has been seen as a male domain: political decision making. However, it also marks the start of a journey towards modernity. Allow me to explain: for us, modernity does not mean women’s quotas being enforced on Member States, regional authorities and so on down to company boards of directors. The women we support in politics are not simply puppets put up for election just to comply with regulations, but people who have made a conscious and deliberate decision to play an active part in politics. To these motivated, passionate women who manage their family lives, social lives and professional lives so that they might help to build a better society, whether public or private, we give our backing and the means to follow their inspiration. In some Italian regions, if two candidates are being voted for, then one of them must be a woman. This ‘Double Preference Gender Vote’ is a right afforded to anyone wanting to cast more than one vote. It seems to be the only way to allow good, educated, competent and generous women who want to serve in politics to succeed in doing just that.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of this report as it highlighted the fact that women are under-represented in leading political decision-making bodies. This under-representation is a reflection of the structural discrimination against women in capitalist society. Women are mainly responsible for child-rearing and caring duties and are more likely to take time out of work to fulfil these roles. This leads to discrimination against working women who are less likely to gain promotions, leading to women being concentrated in lower-paid and precarious jobs. Sexism and stereotyping is also a real and serious barrier to women in capitalist society and impacts on women taking leading positions in organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">I abstained on the separate votes in this report on gender quotas. I do not believe that gender quotas will fundamentally alter discrimination against women in capitalist society. To tackle this discrimination there need to be measures such as state-run, quality, free child care, together with state investment in public services, a significant increase in the minimum wage, the right to a living wage, paid maternity and paternity leave. Quotas will, at best, just give an image of equality without altering the reality for millions of working-class and poor women.</p>

A quota in both the private and the public sector represents a breach of current legislation. Therefore, I have voted against the report. Quotas involve the risk that the principle of equal treatment will be suppressed, because in my opinion, any form of quota represents discrimination. In addition, quota regulations are counterproductive because they result in highly qualified women being branded as quota fillers. The decision to appoint a person to a position should be made only on the basis of their qualifications and not their gender.</p>

      <p sl="et">The measures listed in Ms Pietikäinen’s report are of vital importance in eliminating persistent inequality in various appointed and elected political positions. I believe that political parties, which have the authority to compile lists of election candidates, have the biggest role to play in solving this problem. The compilation of gender-balanced lists of election candidates is of decisive importance in ensuring that women have equal access to leading positions in society. In addition to its effectiveness, the implementation of voluntary, agreed or compulsory quotas in the compilation of lists of election candidates is also the least painful way to raise women to a position where they can compete equally with men – no men are deprived of their positions by the introduction of quotas, but women are instead given a fairer starting position in relation to men. In addition to quotas, awareness campaigns regarding the inequality between women and men and its manifestations can help overturn deep-rooted and outdated gender stereotypes. It is still a common view (among men and even among women themselves) that equality between the genders is a pseudo-problem. This societal attitude is, for instance, intensified by the misinterpretation of the topics of the wage gap or gender quotas in the media. As a result, we should allocate additional funds for education and awareness on the issue of gender inequality, for instance, through campaigns. As a result of improved awareness and women’s equal competitive opportunities, we can achieve fairer participation for women in political decision making.</p>

Creating an environment enabling women to take part in political life at all levels is another measure required. Establishing a work-life balance is recognised at EU level as an important priority for achieving gender equality and facilitating the opportunities for women to take part in political life. The Commission and Member States must design and implement effective gender equality policies and strategies aimed at achieving parity in terms of participation in political decision making and leadership at all levels, especially in the areas of macro-economic policy, trade, labour, budgets, defence and foreign affairs.

However, there is still a long way to go before this goal is achieved, since the lack of financial resources, the predominantly male culture of politics, stereotypes and the difficulty of balancing family life with political life constitute serious obstacles. As such, there is a need to pursue affirmative action in this area, specifically by adopting special temporary measures intended to speed up the establishment of genuine equality between men and women, in order that the proportion of political posts occupied by women might be similar to that in Scandinavian countries. As such, the Member States and the political parties themselves should create an environment that encourages women’s involvement in the world of politics, both through education and through funding general public awareness campaigns on gender issues, and the elimination of gender stereotypes and of preconceptions about women.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Firstly, I want to thank Ms Pietikäinen for her commendable work. It is very obvious that, if it is to be truly established, democracy depends on the representation of both sexes in political decision making. That is why the participation of women in politics must be promoted at regional, national and European level.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The means to achieve this, however, should not involve artificial legislative measures. People’s personal merits should be the basis of the nomination and selection of candidates. Quotas would easily lead to massive opposition and, to my mind, they belittle women.</p>

We need actively to influence attitudes to women and gender roles, and the stereotypes associated with them. This process must begin at school. It is especially important to provide children with diverse role models to support their development. Women should be encouraged to get involved in politics from an early age.

For this objective to be achieved, there should be direct involvement of the political parties in Europe through the introduction of quota systems for candidate lists and elections, for example, or through a system that alternates the first position on the list between female and male candidates. The report also stresses the need for national parliaments and the European Parliament to adopt specific measures to promote gender parity. I believe that the Commission’s actions to this effect represent great progress. To ensure that these actions are implemented satisfactorily, however, resources have to be provided to the political parties that wish to undertake campaigns to promote greater female participation in decision making.

It is true that these networks are not established in order to keep women out of management positions. Instead, they develop automatically in the course of people’s careers. However, their effect is precisely that. Women find it difficult to penetrate these circles. I am also in favour of legal authorisation for abortion. In this case, too, it would be better if abortions did not take place. However, the reality is somewhat different. Therefore, women must be guaranteed a certain level of legal certainty. If we were not to do this, the consequence would not necessarily be fewer abortions.

      <p sl="pl">I voted in favour of the report on women in political decision making. The number of women who are politically active is growing, and women’s issues occupy an increasingly important place in the programmes of political parties. Nevertheless, women do not enjoy parity in political decision making. In EU countries, on average, there is one woman for every four members of the national parliament and government; in the business world, the proportion of women to men is lower at each decision-making level, and the situation is similar in the science and research sector. Gender disparities in this sector are considered to be the main obstacle to achieving greater competitiveness and to maximising potential in the science sector globally. The need for balanced representation of women and men is not just a feminist political slogan, but a necessity. Without parity, policies cannot be efficient and effective. Equal participation of women and men leads to better results in the public sphere, and creates better, more balanced decisions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Only greater involvement of women in politics can ensure that expenditure under state and local budgets is structured properly, because – contrary to appearances – budgets are gender sensitive. Diversity contributes to improved quality in decision-making processes, in terms of diversity of opinions, style of politics and ideas. This cannot be achieved without sufficient participation in politics by different groups, including, in particular, parity of women’s participation.</p>

To create an enabling environment for women to take part in political life at all levels is another required measure.

      <p sl="pl">In a modern representative democracy, it really is hard to come to terms with the fact that the average participation of women in the national parliaments of the Member States is 24%. There are still too many reasons behind this disturbing phenomenon. Discriminatory party nomination procedures are often an obstacle to women’s involvement in politics, closing the door to politics for women at the very outset. It is extremely difficult to balance public life with family life, responsibility for which still lies mostly with women. This needs to change; we need to take action to promote women’s participation in politics, for the benefit of us all. Statutory quotas are undoubtedly a catalyst for change in our society, in particular, those connected with the perception of women’s role in society. We must strive to achieve a breakthrough level of 30%. When the participation of women in a parliament, board or any other kind of organisational unit exceeds 30%, women begin to be treated equally, because 30% female participation in a group means that the visible gender division disappears.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on women in political decision making – quality and equality, because equal representation of women and men in political decision making is a matter of human rights, social justice, sustainable development, as well as being a vital requirement for the functioning of a democratic society. Gender balance is guaranteed in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. The purpose of gender equality is to provide better political representation for women. Women’s representation in political decision making has stagnated in recent years, with the gender imbalance in national parliaments across the EU remaining unchanged (24% women and 76% men), with women accounting for only 23% of ministers. The Nordic countries have the highest level of female representation in national parliaments, with 42.3%. In the European Parliament, 35% of members are women and 65% men. I call on the Commission to submit a yearly report to the European Parliament on the progress of gender equality in political decision making in the European Union. I also call on the Commission and the Council to commit to meeting the parity target in all their decision-making bodies by establishing and implementing quota systems when recruiting high-level officials.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report notes the under-representation of women in elected and appointed posts in bodies under national sovereignty and in the European Parliament itself, as well as in what it calls the ‘top jobs’. In order to solve this problem, it advocates the introduction of quota systems promoting parity in these areas. We believe women’s political participation is about the various areas of women’s lives: their participation in organisations, trades unions and culture, and in their daily lives. Women have greater difficulties participating in these areas owing to problems accessing education and culture, but also due to the economic difficulties that are the immediate result of the wage inequalities of which they are victims. Moreover, the result of precarious jobs is that they have little time for social and political participation. The lack of public child care services is another factor contributing to the overburdening of women. It is these structural inequalities that should be combated rather than establishing artificial equality, whilst keeping the real problems of the majority of women off limits. Furthermore, we do not accept any intervention in parties’ internal affairs, as advocated in items 5, 6 and 7; this is a matter that concerns only their members.</p>

The context of this own-initiative report is the release of the latest Commission communication on this issue, published in February 2011. Equality between men and women constitutes one of the fundamental principles of EU law and that is the commitment that needs to be renewed, thereby consolidating gender equality in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, this report tackles very sensitive issues, such as mutual recognition of civil unions and families comprising same-sex couples, abortion, the role of women in political decision making and the use of quotas, and even the Maternity Leave Directive. I therefore believe there is a long way to go in this regard, given that the strategy for achieving the proposed objectives also involves there genuinely being greater concentration and focus on the issue of equality between men and women in the European Union, distracting us from other issues that, while related, could nevertheless obscure the true scale of this problem.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report. Cooperative societies play an important role in boosting development of rural areas as well as social, economic and territorial cohesion. There are 160 000 cooperatives in the EU with around 5.4 million employees. However, only a small proportion of these cooperatives have chosen the Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE). By 2010, only 17 SCEs had been established in the whole of the EU, with 32 employees. Such a situation is unsatisfactory because cooperatives and other social economy enterprises are an important part of the European social model and they must be recognised and supported at Member State and EU level. The adoption of the SCE in 2003 is a major step facilitating the development of such companies in the EU, but its revision has revealed that it is not entirely suited to the specific circumstances of cooperative societies. I welcome the report’s calls for the existing Statute to be reviewed and amended so that it meets the needs of the market and for an autonomous and clear legal framework for SCEs to be established.</p>

Hence, the importance of this report on the specific case of the SCE and the involvement of employees. As the Statute was not adapted to the special characteristics of the SCE, it is essential to revise the corresponding regulation in order to guarantee fair competition between cooperative societies and investor-driven companies, and to contribute to the development of the transnational activities of cooperative societies. Through this report, I support the call for EU policies in all areas to recognise the specificities and added value of social economy enterprises, especially SCEs, by adapting the legislation on public procurement, State aid and the Financial Regulation accordingly.

Cooperatives are an important pillar of the European economy and a key driver for social innovation because they help to preserve infrastructure and local services, above all, in rural areas and conurbations. At present, legislation regarding cooperatives and employee participation varies substantially across the European Union and the Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE) is, thus far, the social economy’s only legal instrument at EU level. The European Parliament highlights the potential of the SCE for promoting gender equality through the implementation of policies and programmes at various levels, paying particular attention to education, vocational training, action to promote entrepreneurship and ongoing training programmes. Furthermore, gender equality in decision making at various levels is economically beneficial and also creates favourable conditions enabling skilled and talented people to carry out management and supervisory duties. Some aspects of cooperative work provide flexibility that makes it easier to reconcile family and professional life; therefore, the Commission should design a mechanism for the exchange of the best gender equality practices between the Member States.</p>

In almost every Member State, the transposition process has been carried out by adopting legislative provisions preceded by a consultation with the social partners, using procedures that have reflected the specific conventions in each country. The cooperative movement has been involved in this procedure in most Member States. The main way to achieve this objective is by means of an agreement negotiated between the management of the companies involved and the workers’ representatives. If they fail to reach an agreement after six months (which may be extended by common consent to 12 months), the directive stipulates a number of reference provisions. Moreover, the workers’ representatives may decide not to initiate negotiations or to end negotiations and refer to the rules about informing and consulting workers applicable in the Member States in which the SCE has workers.</p>

      <p sl="en">I firmly believe that cooperatives and other social enterprises are part of the single market, and therefore deserve support. Cooperatives have the potential to help towards completion of the EU single market, and we should therefore eliminate existing cross-border obstacles in order to boost their competitiveness. Unfortunately, the European cooperative society (SCE) project, created in 2003, is not yet a success, given its limited use – by 2010, only 17 SCEs had been set up, with a total of 32 employees. This modest figures show the Statute to be poorly suited to the specific circumstances of cooperative societies in Europe, even though entrepreneurs have expressed an interest in setting up SCEs. I welcome the fact that an in-depth assessment of the Statute has been conducted in order to ascertain why it has proven unattractive, why it has had such little impact and what can be done to overcome the lack of experience in implementation and other obstacles. Unfortunately, use of the SCE is often restricted to second-degree cooperatives consisting of legal persons only, by mutual societies which lack a European statute but wish to use a legal status associated with the social economy, and by large companies. For the small cooperative societies which constitute the major part of the cooperative movement in Europe, access to the SCE remains difficult, and the EU should therefore take steps to improve the situation.</p>

This document urgently calls the Commission for greater concern as regards to the SCEs by asking measures to have the implementation of Directive 2003/72/EC supplementing the Statute for a cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees respected by the Member States, and by stressing the disappointing scarcity of funds that are minimising the impact of SCEs.

      <p sl="pt">This own-initiative report, drafted by Mr Giegold, concerns the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees in this form of commerce that we can call social. There are currently over 160 000 cooperatives in Europe, employing around 5.4 million people and guaranteeing local supply, particularly in rural areas. During the present economic and financial crisis, in which we have witnessed an unprecedented decline in public spending and significantly increased rates of unemployment, a social model for the economy founded on cooperatives is of benefit to society. In reality, cooperatives, which are not-for-profit, do not just supply goods and services at more competitive prices, but they also promote programmes of education, vocational training and lifelong learning, as well as fostering entrepreneurship. I therefore support the proposal that the Commission launch the ‘European Year of Social Economy’ and welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted, which not only acknowledges the role of cooperatives in economic growth and job creation, but also encourages the expansion of their scope and number, with a view to achieving the targets set in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

Legal regulations on cooperatives and employee participation across the EU are fundamentally different. The Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE) is, thus far, the only social economy legal form available at EU level. As a result, the SCE is closely interlinked with the directive supplementing the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to employee involvement. Some Member States have transposed articles of the directive relatively successfully, others less so.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I think it would be appropriate for the Commission to develop instruments to facilitate the ownership of cooperatives by employees and users. The participation of employees in enterprises should be taken for granted in all EU Member States and there should be greater employee participation in cross-border forms of enterprise rather than remaining at the lowest level.</p>

      <p sl="it">I think that the promotion of European cooperative societies is fraught with problems, which fall into three main categories. Firstly, quite obviously, there is the meagre number of societies created since the entry into force of the directive. Given the insufficient number of workers involved in them and in light of the results of the Commission’s research, you can see that there is a basic lack of interest in this area. Secondly, the feasibility of these societies is seriously hindered by the diversity of the economies and legal frameworks of the Member States, which prevents the necessary harmonisation for creating trans-European societies. Lastly, the report holds that these societies are a paragon of social economy and stand in contrast to the capitalist system, which could help Europe get out of this crisis. I disagree on this argument and it has been proved wrong by research undertaken in Italy, where such societies were created for the sole purpose of simplifying the administrative requirements of company management. For these reasons, I will be voting against the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Although its creation gave rise to a great deal of enthusiasm in the social economy sector, the reality has, in the end, proved highly disappointing. With just 17 European cooperative societies set up since the implementation of this Statute in 2006, we have to acknowledge that the current Statute is poorly suited to the specific circumstances of cooperative societies in Europe. We therefore need to simplify this instrument, which is the only social economy legal form available at EU level. We also need to make it more user-friendly and better applicable in order to guarantee the rights of information, consultation and participation to all employees. This will be a first step before the revision of the directive relating to the involvement of employees, which could offer workers the option to be both owner and employee of the same enterprise.</p>

I personally believe that cooperatives should be established from the bottom up. The fact that there are only a few isolated European cooperative societies within the EU is due to the fact that such projects cannot be created in a top-down approach from Union level. For those few SCE cooperatives that already exist, however, it is important that the rights of the workers are strengthened. The fact that there is no passage concerning full trade union rights for employees of cooperatives is very regrettable, but, as the report nevertheless entails a step in the right direction, I voted in favour of it.</p>

The Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE) is not yet a success given its scarce use – up to 2010, only 17 SCEs had been established, with a total of 32 employees. These figures show the Statute to be poorly suited to the specific circumstances of cooperative societies in Europe even though entrepreneurs have expressed an interest in setting up an SCE. A revision of the directive should address the specific needs of employees in cooperatives, including the option to be both owner and employee of the same enterprise. I believe that owing to its complexity, the Statute only partially meets the needs of cooperatives and that it should be simplified, made intelligible to all and easier to apply, thus ensuring the rights of information, consultation and participation of all employees without affecting the quality of the Statute. The Statute should provide for an autonomous legal framework for SCEs alongside existing national law on cooperatives and direct harmonisation would therefore not take place. The Member States must ensure more favourable conditions for cooperatives, such as access to credit and tax incentives, etc. Cooperatives are an important pillar of the European economy and a key driver for social innovation and contribute, in particular, to preserving infrastructure and local services, above all, in rural areas and conurbations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In addition to creating cross-border cooperatives, involving employees in the decision-making process in European cooperatives is one of the main objectives behind introducing them into the legal system. It is a step towards cooperatives functioning as entities which realise the needs of their members and users. I am extremely surprised at the low level of implementation of provisions regarding this involvement, in particular, in those countries with a long and rich tradition of cooperatives. I am even more surprised as the European cooperative offers significant potential for economic growth, combining as it does the traditional values of cooperative participation and employee involvement. In the absence of implementation of the relevant provisions, the small number of cooperatives and workers’ groups formed comes as no surprise.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Cooperatives as such, and European cooperatives in particular, provide some remedy at times of crisis, which is confirmed by the increase in their turnover and the lower level of bankruptcies and redundancies compared to other legal persons.

It is good that we are focusing specifically on the subject of cooperatives in the European Parliament, as this is the International Year of Cooperatives. In the European Union, there are around 160 000 cooperatives, which are owned by more than a quarter of all Europeans and employ about 5.4 million people. In my home region of Bavaria alone, there are over 1 200 cooperatives and cooperative enterprises with more than 2.7 million members. Cooperatives are one of the cornerstones of our economy. Their achievements are even more obvious in times of crisis, because cooperatives involve taking joint responsibility. For example, during the financial crisis, cooperative banks demonstrated how sustainable and resilient they are as a result of their cooperative business model. They have not lost billions in the crisis like other banks. On the contrary, their balance sheets show an increase in revenue and growth. They provide 5.4 million high-quality, crisis-proof jobs throughout Europe. Cooperatives have their roots in the regions where they are located. They represent a model for the future, for our regions and for Europe. If we promote the cooperative model as part of EU development policy, we can make a contribution which will really help people, actively involve them and encourage them to be independent. We need more incentives for cooperatives.</p>

Although the 21 million SMEs in the EU are a major asset to sustainable growth and creating jobs, the difficulty SMEs have in accessing funding is a considerable obstacle preventing them from launching new products, strengthening their infrastructures and taking on more employees.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Indeed, Member States need to foster conditions which are more conducive to providing access to loans and tax incentives. In actual fact, providing SMEs with access to funding is a principal objective proposed by the Commission as part of the 12 levers to boost growth and strengthen the confidence of citizens by ‘working together to create new growth’, included in the Single Market Act. The key action proposed by the Commission involves implementing legislation intended to facilitate the possibility of venture capital funds set up in one Member State investing in any other Member State without any barriers or supplementary conditions.</p>

As Conservatives, we have a strong belief, for example, in the huge benefits of communities working together and indeed the invaluable work of the voluntary sector and the social economy. While we strongly believe in the completion of the single market and any effort to improve cross-border business activity, we have a number of concerns with the Statute for a European cooperative society. First, in addition to its complex and bureaucratic nature, most firms who choose to operate as a cooperative tend to be anchored within their own local community and not on a pan-European level. The purpose of a cooperative is, after all, to serve the members who participate directly in the democratic management of the firm. Secondly, an overwhelming majority of cooperatives are small businesses operating within national borders and therefore, there is very little advantage to or added value from a European Statute.

The purpose of revising the regulation on the Statute for a European cooperative society (SCE) is the need to defend workers’ rights to take part in cooperatives.

      <p sl="pt">Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that ‘‘Companies or firms’ means companies or firms constituted under civil or commercial law, including cooperative societies’, while Article 152 of the same Treaty stresses that ‘The Union recognises and promotes the role of the social partners at its level, taking into account the diversity of national systems’. I agree with the majority of the submitted report, since I consider it crucial to acknowledge the role played by cooperatives and other companies of the social economy in building the European social model and the single market. I also agree that there should be more encouragement for workers to participate in the active life of companies. However, I would express my opposition to the adoption of quotas of 30% women at senior management levels and on the boards of public and listed companies by 2015 and 40% by 2020, since I do not consider this the proper way to promote the merit, ability and knowledge acquired by women over the years. Finally, I believe that cooperatives play a very important role in regional cooperation, since they bring producers far closer together at local level, thereby fostering increased social, economic and territorial cohesion.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the Statute for a European cooperative society with regard to the involvement of employees because more than 160 000 cooperative societies across Europe provide jobs for approximately 5.4 million people. Cooperative societies create jobs that are of high quality, local, inclusive and resilient to the impact of the crisis, and which, in theory, cannot be relocated. We call on the Commission and Member States to encourage cooperatives to step up their efforts to implement diversity policies in order to guarantee gender equality in professional life and, in particular, increase women’s access to senior management positions. With this in mind, we urge the Commission to include European cooperative societies in any potential European regulation aimed at guaranteeing better representation for women at management levels and on the boards of public and listed companies, in the event that companies do not voluntarily achieve the targets of 30% by 2015 and 40% by 2020. Member States must also promote business support measures, in particular, business consultancy, employee training and access to funding.</p>

It is clear to us that the promotion of the social economy and the cooperative sector could be an important factor in strengthening productive systems, particularly those associated with local and regional needs and realities. It is also true that the ways in which cooperatives are managed should create fairer and more equitable means of redistributing these organisations’ products across their members and workers. As such, we consider it positive that the report demonstrates the importance of the transposition by the Member States of the directive’s articles concerning workers’ rights, and that measures are being taken to encourage the development potential of cooperatives, particularly today, in times of economic crisis. However, we do not acknowledge the premise that the future SCE statute should encourage the development of the European Union’s internal market; that is, of a market that promotes the free movement of capital, goods and services within a framework of capitalist competition.</p>

I do not deny the success that has been achieved, but I also completely agree with Mr Berlinguer when he talks about ‘unfinished governance’. Essentially, we cannot fail to notice the many barriers to mobility faced by students, not only in territorial terms, but also horizontally (between degree cycles) and vertically (within degree cycles), and especially in the recognition of diplomas and qualifications.

The continued provision of European or national support to ensure easy and fair access to education and to increase the representation of disadvantaged social groups is vital to the strategy’s success in this area.</p>

The process of developing the research sector is just as important. I regard it as vital to creating an economy capable of supporting sustainable development based on innovation and competition.

I support what is in the report in relation to funding for third-level institutes and increasing the number of research and educational courses for the purposes of encouraging a knowledge-based economy in the EU. Clear, accessible information should be available to all the people of Europe on training courses and qualifications. I commend what is in the report in relation to accessibility of information on improving university, professional and training courses, and that specific information be available in relation to the mobility of qualifications in the EU.

This type of mobility can substantially reduce unemployment, including, in particular, frictional unemployment. Furthermore, it should be noted that the forms of cooperation resulting from this process make a major contribution to the exchange and practical use of experience, and to research and development. It is therefore especially important for the higher education institutions of Member States to be able to engage in suitable cooperation with their third-country counterparts as well, an additional reason for this being that such relations promote the preservation and proliferation of culture. It is very important to make quality education and the opportunities provided by the Bologna process accessible to citizens in all Member States. I therefore find it worth considering in future to develop a single, objective system for the selection of students allowed to pursue studies abroad.</p>

Although a lot has been achieved, the Member States have so far delayed addressing the issue of mutual recognition of qualifications and mutual trust, which is preventing the creation of a European market in higher education.

Despite the far-reaching reforms already carried out, further progress is still required. That is why I voted in favour of the Berlinguer report, which calls for rapid consolidation of this process, in particular, through greater harmonisation of university standards, better recognition of degrees across the Union and increased student mobility.

The current financial crisis is likely to entail a further reduction in financial resources available across the education sector. The economic context should compel us to encourage acceleration in the process, and to study new financial frameworks which allow for a more effective implementation of the objectives of growth and excellence of European universities. In my opinion, the first goal of the Bologna process remains a fundamental requirement: a student enrolled in a European university has the right to graduate and to see his qualification recognised throughout the EU. The ministerial conference of the Bologna process will take place in April 2012. It is of paramount importance that the formulation of the new commitments for the three years that separate us from the next ministerial meeting should not be limited to the establishment of a list of benchmarks, but rather include concrete measures to promote the full realisation of the goals of the Bologna process in every university and Member State.</p>

European universities have not only radically revised and reorganised their teaching activities in the three-level framework established by the Bologna process, but they have also strengthened their social role with activities better suited to what is known as the ‘third mission’ of the university system. It is worth us mentioning that there has not always been a good connection between this system and the labour market. As a result, the statement made in the Lisbon document – ‘European universities, despite a reasonably good quality of teaching, are unable to express their full potential in order to promote economic growth, social cohesion and the improvement in the quality and quantity of jobs’ – still holds.

The role of higher education is to provide a learning environment open to everyone without discrimination, promoting autonomy, creativity, access to quality education and the broadening of knowledge, and, to this end, it is essential to guarantee the involvement of the academic community as a whole, particularly students, teachers and researchers, in developing the various stages of university education.

I would like to draw attention in this context to the strong link between the Bologna process and the Professional Qualifications Directive, and to stress the need for coordination by the Commission. The connection can be further strengthened by providing students with all the relevant practical information concerning the recognition of diplomas obtained abroad and the job opportunities which training abroad opens up.

Indeed, increased standardisation of curricula vitae would contribute to mutual recognition in the labour market and thereby facilitate graduate mobility. Above all, this is a key way to encourage enterprises to get involved in university science programmes and also to convince the Member States to dedicate at least 3% of their gross domestic product to education and science during this time of crisis.

      <p sl="el">I voted against this motion for a resolution because I am opposed to the continuation and completion of the Bologna process, which promotes the application of neoliberalism in higher education and turns universities into institutions that serve the interests of businesses and the market. The ‘competitiveness / mobility / employability’ triptych is designed to create a flexible scientific workforce without protected labour and professional rights; at the same time, it reinforces class barriers in higher education by opposing the free State education that they should provide. The Bologna process turns education from a public good into a commodity and homogenises diplomas and courses, on the basis of market needs, rather than social needs. At the same time, the ECTS system for first degrees (bachelor’s), the procedure proposed for post-graduate studies (master’s degree), and lifelong learning programmes such as those proposed, is an attempt to alter the global, scientific knowledge provided to young scientists by providing them simply with fragmented and specialist knowledge based solely on the interests of their employers. Finally, the text conceals the fact that all the reforms being applied within the framework of the neoliberally-oriented Bologna process are resulting in under-funding of scientific research in the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for the Berlinguer report on the Bologna process. Europe should set the standard in terms of the quality of education and training and should ensure that education and training systems are compatible, so as to enable mobility throughout the EU; not just in the geographical terms of within and between countries, but also horizontally between study stages, and vertically within study stages. I welcome the relationship established between Bologna and the targets for growth based on knowledge and innovation under the Europe 2020 strategy, as well as the importance of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) to creating and developing genuine European citizens. I regret that some European universities seem reluctant to contribute to strengthening the EHEA, which is crucial to increasing the competitiveness and quality of the knowledge they produce. I agree that the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System should be more transparent and provide the possibility of establishing more precise comparisons between qualifications and degrees. I welcome the Commission proposal to increase substantially the funding for European education and training programmes, and I hope it will help with enabling students with financial difficulties to access these programmes.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on the consolidation of the Bologna process. I think that its principles will help to improve prospects for economic growth in the Union, as well as fitting in with the Europe 2020 strategy. In particular, the proposal will help make it easier for students to get into work and improve their mobility – laudable aims in themselves, both in the wider context of combating the financial crisis and youth unemployment. In my opinion, the recognition of diplomas in all Member States is a necessary condition for ensuring true freedom of movement within the EU. Moreover, I am convinced that the proposal will facilitate this recognition and help harmonise and improve academic standards, thereby contributing indirectly to the improvement process set out in the Professional Qualifications Directive, currently under discussion in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO). While congratulating Mr Berlinguer on his excellent work, I would like to take the opportunity to point out the importance of April’s ministerial conference in Bucharest, since I believe that this meeting will help towards the definition of an action plan for the near future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Like the rapporteur, I believe the creation of a European Higher Education Area is, without doubt, one of the outstanding achievements of EU history. Unfortunately, this reform is unfinished, which is very much because of a lack of genuine involvement from all the stakeholders – the education sector/legislators – in implementing the Bologna process. The rapporteur identifies a number of problems. First off, the top-down approach; that is, the imposition on universities by the Member States/the EU of models developed in advance without the full involvement of the main players in the education process. Other problems identified are the lack of links between higher education establishments and the labour market, higher education students’ lack of mobility within the EU, and the problems with mutual recognition of university degrees within Europe. Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis can currently be added to the aforementioned problems, which has led many Member States to cut their education budgets. Nevertheless, I consider reinforcing the Bologna process absolutely crucial to achieving the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. Naturally, the EU must play a key role in its effective implementation. That is why I voted for this report.</p>

European universities have reorganised their activities using a framework of the three stages set out in the Bologna process, with a view to the so-called ‘third mission’ of the higher education system. The recognition and standardisation of the education systems throughout the European Union are encouraging the mobility of students, fostering European integration, in general, and growth and jobs, in particular. A few days before the ministerial conference on the Bologna process, therefore, there is a need to formulate concrete measures to promote full compliance with its objectives in all the universities of all the Member States, to the ultimate benefit of European professional training and competitiveness.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The University of Bologna, founded in 1088 and with the motto Alma Mater Studiorum , is Europe’s oldest university and celebrated its 900th anniversary in 1988; it remains a centre of higher-education excellence. In 1998, on the occasion of the 800th anniversary of the University of Paris, a group of European ministers signed the Sorbonne Declaration, with the intention of harmonising the European higher education system. On 19 June 1999, 30 European countries signed the Bologna Declaration, the objective of which was to establish, by 2010, a European Higher Education Area that is coherent, compatible, competitive and attractive to students from Europe and third countries; an area that promotes European cohesion through the knowledge, mobility and employability of its graduates, so as to ensure that Europe will perform better in the world. Through the mutual recognition of academic qualifications by the various universities of the signatory countries, the Bologna process enables the greater mobility of persons, in general, and students, in particular. I welcome the adoption of this report and I am sure it will be a major incentive to continuing this process and that it will contribute to achieving the objectives of Education and Training 2020 and the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The rapporteur’s apologist vision seeks to obscure or minimise some of the most serious consequences of the Bologna process. These include, inter alia , the creation of economic barriers to accessing and attending higher education; the commercialisation of education, driving away those without the financial means to ‘buy’ the ‘products’ that the various ‘stages’ of higher education have now become; and the attack on the social role of the state in this area, which is enshrined in the constitutions of countries like Portugal, although this is not respected. Education as a right that should be guaranteed to all, irrespective of individual financial circumstances, has been called into question. The role of the education system in overcoming social inequalities has been called into question, replaced by a knowledge ‘market’ and a new business opportunity that ensure the reproduction of social inequalities. Those are some of the consequences of the Bologna process. The proclaimed objective of student mobility has fallen by the wayside, since mobility rates are low, as the report itself acknowledges. The harmonisation of curricula ignores the specific characteristics of each country’s education system, in a trend towards training for the workplace rather than integrated education. Quality is declining and many students are obliged to indebt themselves in order to access a fundamental right.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The creation of an open European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has been a major achievement and represents a broad institutional framework for the implementation of the ambitious process set in motion by the Bologna process. Intergovernmental cooperation and the strategies set out by the European institutions have been the stimulus for a far-reaching structural reform of the European higher education system. European universities have deeply revised and reorganised their teaching activities, while also strengthening their social role.</p>
      <p sl="sk">It must be noted, however, that the connection between this system and the labour market has not always been successful. For this reason, the strengthening of the whole Bologna process is of fundamental significance. The first goal of the Bologna process remains the basic requirement that every student enrolled in a European university has the right to complete his studies and to see his qualification recognised across the EU. The European institutions and the Member States play a crucial role here, especially in the recognition of qualifications and mobility policy. At this stage, however, the EHEA is not fully developed.</p>
      <p sl="sk">I am of the opinion that it is important to enhance its potential to the maximum and to address the many open questions such as the role of government regulation, budgetary constraints, quality control, and national accreditation. Consequently, those participating in the Bologna process – universities, students, teachers, trade unions, the business sector – have a crucial responsibility to ensure that the process is actually rooted in the academic body concerned.</p>

It is hoped that this will help increase employment levels and mobility, as well as promote European higher education across the world. Great progress has been made over the years, but the process is still far from complete.

Thanks to the Bologna system, we can speak of a European higher education system, and I consider this to be a huge achievement in our progress towards the compatibility of education systems in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Bologna process is a challenge because it initiated enormous changes. Education reform has not only enabled students to make use of educational programmes at foreign universities, but also increases the role played by universities in society. It is now important to strengthen the Bologna system in order to make it possible to realise in full the proposal that a student who studies at a given university is entitled to receive a degree, and that his qualification should be recognised throughout the EU. In other words, we have to create a learning-friendly environment and increase student mobility. Strengthening and developing the Bologna process, in particular through the recognition of qualifications, the harmonisation of academic standards and the promotion of mobility are the right way to achieve this objective. Therefore, I am pleased that, in the report adopted today, MEPs have called for more involvement at Union and national level and by all key entities participating in the Bologna process. Subsequent obligations taken on by Member States relating to the Bologna process should be specific and should aim to promote the full realisation of the process.</p>

The objective of social cohesion has become a central part of the EHEA. It is a prerequisite, which must be met for the EHEA to be consolidated. More importance should be attached to equitable access and to the completion of higher education at all levels.

The number of places on Master’s courses needs to be tailored to existing demand, bearing in mind that in some Member States, a Bachelor’s degree offers low employment prospects. At the same time, the status of pre-Bologna process students in those countries where they are disadvantaged in terms of enrolling in Masters’ programmes needs to be regulated.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, universities in the signatory states must recognise the practical internships completed as part of the mobility programmes supported by the European Commission, while creating a sufficient number of traineeships for students, so as to facilitate their future entry into the labour market.</p>

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this report on the contribution of the European institutions to the consolidation and progress of the Bologna process. In fact, the creation of a European Higher Education Area represents the final stage of the ambitious system launched by the Bologna process. The wide-ranging structural reform of the European higher education system has not had the expected and hoped-for success. Nevertheless, it represents a major target to hit in order to enable the growth set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, a major requirement for the complete integration of the EU market, and one of the only tools available to defy the economic and financial crisis that Europe is undergoing. I call for the increased involvement of all stakeholders, since the minimal respect for the guidelines of the process by some European universities demonstrates the need to implement new teaching strategies, as well as to identify new measures to support this process.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The primary objective of the Bologna process is to create a compatible system of higher education in Europe, and to eliminate the barriers preventing people from pursuing studies abroad. Involving the academic community in designing such an educational system can contribute to the effectiveness of the process. Special attention must be paid to the mutual recognition of diplomas because there have been problems in this regard in a number of Member States. We must make sure that university diplomas obtained in the EU are recognised and usable on the labour market without discrimination. A vital condition for implementing the process is to make the right to study economically accessible to everyone. Particular attention must be paid to vulnerable groups in order to facilitate their access to fair and better job opportunities. Common action at European level is needed to improve results and overcome unresolved issues; the EU has the means to ensure the creation of a more efficient system. Since the report intends to remedy the aforesaid issues I, too, voted in favour of it.</p>

The report also calls on Member States and the Union to determine whether courses of study could include a compulsory period of education to be completed by the student at a university in a Member State other than the home country.

In fact, this involves a number of difficulties which have not yet been resolved. For example, the Netherlands requires many German students attending Dutch universities to make compensatory payments. Austria has raised similar problems in the Council. Hungary, in particular, has seen an influx of German students wanting to study medicine. In contrast, Germany claims that it accepts more students from other countries within the EU than it exports. The idea of introducing quotas to prevent an overflow of students from EU Member States was rejected by the Court of Justice of the European Union as being illegal. In the light of the oversubscribed courses at some universities, the Bologna process should not be applying the principle of encouraging students who cannot get a place at a university in their own country to move to another country where they will take the places of local students.

      <p sl="sk">I would like to congratulate the godfather of the Bologna process, Mr Berlinguer, on this own-initiative report, in which he wanted to draw attention back to the important issue of youth mobility for educational purposes. It was important to recapitulate the shortcomings and problems arising from the implementation of the Bologna process that slowed it down, so that we can quickly achieve its goal – that the academic qualifications and education of students at any European university are recognised and valid throughout the European Union in order to create a genuine European university citizenship and to strengthen employability.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Education is a public responsibility of the Member States, EU institutions, and other key players, so it is essential to keep funding and improving education for young people across Europe, including in the context of their mobility. It is also necessary to create some sort of common core curriculum, establish uniform academic titles throughout Europe, and recognise credits obtained by students from their studies with regard to their mobility in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Mobility should be for everyone and should be the basis for the reform of higher education. In this context, it is also essential to establish the common European Qualifications Framework and, subsequently, to implement it effectively at the national level. I therefore continue to keep my fingers crossed for this project and hope that this new report will contribute to the improvement of the Bologna process as quickly as possible and that we can count on 100% support from all stakeholders.</p>

      <p sl="de">The Bologna process has, in fact, made no progress for several years. The aim of creating a European Higher Education Area has remained a vision. It is high time that concrete measures are taken concerning the recognition of diplomas and degrees. In order to achieve this, we need to promote freedom of movement within national university systems, because in Austria, for example, students’ qualifications are often recognised in one province and not in another. In addition, the Bologna process cannot be implemented without incurring additional costs, which means providing financial support for the universities. The money should be used to develop national education systems further, so that we can fully exploit the potential of the European Higher Education Area. In addition, we urgently need to reduce the amount of red tape. For example, in order to get a place at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, prospective students first have to overcome the hurdle of access restrictions on medical courses and then demonstrate that they have studied the relevant subjects (physics, biology and maths) in their last two years at school. However, these additional points will only be recognised if the school-leaving certificate confirms that the student has studied these subjects. Other official certificates are not recognised, purely for bureaucratic and discriminatory reasons. As Austrian and French school-leaving certificates do not contain this information, students from these countries are put at a disadvantage and this amounts to discrimination. As the report does not mention this, I have abstained from voting.</p>

Like the Schengen Area, the Bologna process is the best showcase of European integration. However, this report correctly identifies areas where there is still much to be done in order for the most important objective of the Bologna process to be achieved. These include the mutual recognition of degrees, the mutual recognition of qualifications and the harmonisation of core curricula. I also welcome the rapporteur’s emphasis on the social dimension of the Bologna process. The Union must accord the utmost importance to fair access and to higher education for all groups within society. Access to education cannot be contingent on the financial, cultural or social capital of young Europeans’ families.

I believe that the Member States should pay particular attention to employment opportunities, and there should therefore be student and lecturer exchanges and an effective dialogue between universities and business representatives.

      <p sl="en">The creation of a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) must be supported at the European level because the challenges EHEA faces cannot be solved by the individual Member States. The Bologna process is not only about recognition of diplomas across Europe. It is a very comprehensive tool to tackle such important issues as youth unemployment, which is about 20% nowadays. European youth need the means to become more mobile. 53% of young people in the EU are worried about the absence of jobs in their city or region. 42% refer to the lack of good job opportunities and the same number considers that jobs are poorly paid and that salaries are not adequate for a reasonable standard of living. I urge the Member States and the EU to provide more support for students willing to study abroad. Two major problems have to be tackled: the lack of funds and lack of information on studying and scholarship opportunities. 65% of young people finance their stay abroad with their private funds and savings. Currently, more than 4 in 10 (44%) of young people are not willing, or would not like, to work in another European country. Support for studies will significantly promote European citizenship, cultural diversity and foster intercultural dialogue.</p>

In light of the forthcoming Council meeting next month, at which developments will be discussed and new objectives will be set for achieving the objectives set out in the Bologna process, certain general findings need to be formulated. Twelve years after the Bologna Declaration, the climate in the EU is very different. Firstly, the economic crisis affecting numerous Member States, which has resulted in millions of Europeans, trained Europeans, young people with diplomas, being made unemployed requires a very fast policy on recognition of their skills, so as to encourage their mobility, among other things. Secondly, unlike the previous decade, the trend today in numerous Member States is to reduce spending on education by up to 10% compared with 2009. This should not be overlooked. Strong education and strong research in Europe are objectives set in the EU 2020 strategy. This requires robust, not sub-standard education. This reference must not be omitted from the forthcoming Council and it must not be divorced from the objectives of the Bologna process.</p>

I voted for this report, which provides for measures to improve this process. This process is essential to realising the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.

I have voted in favour of this report as it highlights the EU’s commitment to young Europeans, ensuring they have the opportunity to enjoy a multicultural education and comprehensive recognition, irrespective of their origin or economic resources. The importance of the Bologna process and the consolidation of the EHEA in aiding Europe to counter the current period of economic instability must also be highlighted. For this reason, it calls for the need for the Member States and the EU to support this process by increasing public investment in higher education and promoting grants for students. The functions of research and innovation in European universities also need increased investment from the Member States and the EU, given that they are vital for the future development of the Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Student and teacher mobility in Europe is still in its infancy: fewer than four students out of 100 make use of it at present. Mr Berlinguer’s report, adopted at lunchtime today, comes just at the right time. It points out that there are still too many obstacles when it comes to the recognition of degrees and the ease of studying abroad, and it makes some interesting suggestions. The European Parliament calls on the Member States to redouble their efforts to enhance the consistency of the Bologna process.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That covers everything from cooperation between universities and the mutual recognition of ECTS credits and university degrees to increased financial support.

I welcome, first and foremost, the recognition of the key role played by higher education, reinforced by the Bologna process, in achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy in terms of employment and growth. In this regard, all of the actors must be involved: teachers, students and businesses in particular. This is essential to improve what is offered by universities and provide job opportunities for students.

I also welcome the social dimension of the report, which openly calls for equitable access and the completion of higher education at all levels. I am pleased that I was able to get a call included in the report for greater transparency concerning the information provided to students regarding the conditions for completing foreign traineeships, as well as support for teacher mobility.</p>

      <p sl="it">Twenty-nine countries signed the Bologna Declaration on 29 June 1999. They therefore committed to work together to create, by 2010, a European Higher Education Area that would enable convergence among the European education systems, thus increasing the employability and mobility of EU citizens, and to promote European higher education across the world.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am completely in favour of the text that we voted on in plenary this morning, but I would like to emphasise in particular that the Member States’ commitment to provide greater funding for higher education by increasing public investment could help combat the economic crisis and encourage growth based on enhancing knowledge. This increased national commitment to funding should also be accompanied by an effective, bottom-up approach, fully involving all key actors such as universities, trade unions, professional organisations, research institutions and the business sector.</p>
      <p sl="it">Lastly, I feel I must stress that measures to promote employability, such as lifelong learning, are absolutely necessary for achieving more effective cooperation between universities and the labour market with a view to developing more relevant curricula. This may also help ensure the availability of a sufficient number of traineeships for students, so as to further facilitate their joining the job market. These initiatives must therefore be seen as a priority.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The goal of creating a European Higher Education Area is crucial to establishing a European society genuinely based on knowledge and innovation, as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. To this end, the Bologna process was launched in 1999, with the objective of enabling a student matriculated at a European university to have the right to be educated and have their qualifications recognised throughout the EU. The system launched by the Bologna process, which created three stages and the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, has hit a number of obstacles in institutional and applicability terms. There is a need to step up intergovernmental cooperation and increase the involvement of the main players in the process: universities, students and companies. As such, consideration needs to be given to physical, horizontal and vertical mobility; to recognition of qualifications and the framework of formal, non-formal and informal qualifications; to guaranteeing the quality of the institutions; to the inclusiveness and social cohesion of university teaching; to university/business cooperation; and to university involvement in creating innovation. Eliminating the obstacles outlined above will turn Europe into an area of teaching excellence.</p>

      <p sl="en">The Bologna process has been vital in making student, researcher and teacher mobility in the EU possible. Nevertheless, the numbers of those who study or teach in another Member State are still very low. Targeted support is needed from the EU institutions to assist Member States and higher education institutions to meet Bologna requirements. Renewed efforts by education institutions and national organisations themselves are also essential in implementing reforms needed to close implementation gaps so that a true European Higher Education Area becomes a reality. Problems with the mutual recognition of academic qualifications, the calculation of ECTS and grades, core curricula, the recognition of Erasmus and practical experience gained abroad continue to act as barriers to students wishing to study in another EU Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">I fully endorse Mr Berlinguer’s report. EU support for the Bologna process will ensure we meet the EU 2020 goals for jobs and growth, as mobility among students will lead to greater labour mobility. The revision of the Professional Qualifications Directive will complement the Bologna process by providing assurances that qualifications gained in another Member State will be recognised across the EU.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the contribution of the European institutions to the consolidation and progress of the Bologna process because this consolidation must apply to the support for reciprocal recognition of university qualifications, the harmonisation of academic standards, the promotion of mobility, the social aspect and employability, active democratic participation, and to eliminating administrative obstacles preventing the implementation of the Bologna process principles. I voted for Member States to reiterate their commitment to the Bologna process by strengthening the funding system in order to achieve the growth targets set by the Europe 2020 strategy. I voted for paragraph 26, which emphasises that measures to promote employability (for example, lifelong learning and the development of a broader range of skills suitable for the labour market) must be top priorities in order to achieve sustainable growth and prosperity targets. In this regard, we support exchanges of university teachers and students, dialogue between universities and businesses, apprenticeships and the skills passport. We stress the need for specific actions and for more effective cooperation between universities and the labour market with a view to developing more relevant curricula, bringing greater consistency to education and enhancing employability by establishing similar criteria for admission to the various professions.</p>

      <p sl="el">The report highlights the difficulties experienced by the capitalists in achieving full application of the Bologna process, due to contradictions in capitalist growth between Member States and sectors. At the interim review stage, and in the midst of the global capitalist crisis, it emphasises ‘mobility’ in order to serve the profitability objectives of capital. ‘Mobility’ needs to be safeguarded as soon as young people become students, so that they learn to roam around acquiring skills that will enable them to move between low-paid jobs with no rights, rather than acquiring scientific knowledge. The capitalocrats want a minimum level of knowledge, so that graduates can then chase after training and certificates. These same people are seeking to consolidate courses so that they can extend class barriers to education. They fund lifelong learning/exploitation programmes and cut spending on social and student care. They insist on equivalence between diplomas and a single qualification certification system, in order to guarantee cheap specialised workers, so as to increase the competitiveness of the alliance of euro-wolves over other imperialist States and unions. The Greek Communist Party has always taken the view that diplomas should be the only precondition in terms of accessing professions because they are based on solid study and on clearly scientific subjects. The only way to achieve this is through real people-friendly growth, outside the EU, and only the power of the working class and its allies can achieve that.</p>

I am fully in favour of this report, as it attempts to highlight the importance of European institutions showing collective support to the Bologna process to ensure that it continues to develop and strengthen. The link between the Bologna process and the labour market is highlighted by the report as an area in need of further support; increasing recognition of degrees and developing a joint degree system will go a long way to addressing this. The call to recognise the doctorate level throughout the EU is also vitally important; PhD degrees must be recognised, as they are often a brilliant example of academic-business cooperation, which is important for economic growth.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The quality of the education of young Europeans is an imperative that must guide our action. I therefore support this report assessing the Bologna process, launched in 1999 with a view to establishing the framework for high-quality higher education in Europe. My hope is that we can achieve a genuine single market for higher education, based on the far-reaching structural reform known as ‘LMD’. However, I regret that there are still obstacles between the university world and the world of employment. Our House is thus sending out a strong message about the need for better integration of higher education and the job market. With the Europe 2020 strategy, Europe aspires to be the world’s most competitive knowledge-based economy. That is obviously dependent on high-quality teaching, the recognition of degrees and qualifications, and mobility, not to mention student employability. I therefore support the efforts to encourage the business world to be more open to students, through traineeships and work-linked training. Our growth and our competitiveness depend on the level of education of Europe’s young people and their integration into the workplace. The Bologna process must ensure that this gamble pays off.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report attempts to remedy or obscure the most serious consequence of the Bologna process: the increased difficulty of accessing higher education for those facing more severe financial situations, who are unable to buy the products that higher education packages have now become. The paradigm of education as a right that should be guaranteed to all has been inverted, so that there is now a knowledge market and a new business opportunity. The much-trumpeted objective of student mobility has fallen by the wayside, since mobility rates are low, as the report itself acknowledges. It ignores the specific characteristics of each country’s education system in its attempts to harmonise the structure of knowledge and even of content, in a trend towards training for the workplace rather than integrated education. The quality of education is declining, whilst many students are obliged to indebt themselves in order to access a fundamental right.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is needed, as we argue in our alternative motion for a resolution, is for there to be cooperation between Member States in terms of higher education, but for this to be created whilst guaranteeing the right of all to state-run, free and high-quality higher education.</p>

      <p sl="sl">I am pleased the report on the contribution of the European institutions to the Bologna process has just been adopted at the plenary session by a large majority. The rapporteur, MEP and former minister for education, Luigi Berlinguer, has done an excellent job and I worked closely with him while preparing an opinion for my political group, the European People’s Party. I therefore also voted in favour of the Berlinguer report. Since the signing of the Bologna Declaration, the European Higher Education Area has harmonised considerably. All the associated countries have established three stages of higher education studies. However, at the end of the first decade of reform, many issues still remain unresolved. The three-stage system has caused considerable problems in some countries, since this new concept of university has not yet been fully embraced. Unfortunately, most countries have still not implemented national qualification frameworks linked to the European Qualifications Framework. This greatly inhibits the progress of the Bologna process. The Berlinguer report points out that in its second decade, the main aim of the process remains the mutual recognition of diplomas from any university in the EU in all EU Member States. I hope this report helps to remove remaining obstacles as effectively as possible and that the European Higher Education Area becomes an increasingly effective element of European economic recovery.</p>

I agree with the requests put forward by Mr Scicluna on the need for independent, high-quality, precise and exact statistics which can also be accessed easily by the public. Since I am personally concerned with social policies and especially issues affecting children, I could not fail to note the huge gaps concerning some of the vulnerable sections of our society. I have, on several occasions, raised the need to develop a methodology that is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative indicators, as well as comparative standards, that refer specifically to children who have disappeared, are unaccompanied, are victims of physical and psychological violence, or who are disabled.

It is a fact that providing accurate statistics can, in many cases, involve collecting and collating data from numerous sources.

In fact, it adopts a proposal for a systemic approach to the quality of statistics, by which I mean a philosophy of pre-agreed results. The pre-agreed results in today’s EU can very well be translated into austerity policies and drastic cutbacks to labour and social rights. Moreover, the Commission’s reports and the rapporteur are absolutely in line with the agreement on an Enhanced Economic Union that removes the tool of economic and fiscal policy from the Member States.

      <p sl="pt">This own-initiative report is intended to complement the ‘six-pack’ and stresses the importance of the quality of statistics supplied by the Member States. In fact, not knowing the true figures, or at least not being absolutely sure about collection methods for certain macro- or micro-economic statistical variables from one Member State to another – so as to enable reliable comparisons – is a reality that, unfortunately, exists within the EU, as recent events have amply demonstrated. Objectively, this situation must be brought to an end. Reliable and accurate statistics are clearly needed in order for the Member States and the EU to formulate effective economic and budgetary policy, as is clearly stated in the report. It is also clear that these statistical bodies need to be independent and to posses greater powers, not least as regards investigation; that internal and external auditing mechanisms will have to be improved; and that Eurostat should help any Member State that so requires. I therefore welcome this own-initiative report and commend the rapporteur. Obviously, I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the motion for a European Parliament resolution on quality management for European statistics because I firmly believe that improvements in the quality of statistics delivery, and in their driving mechanisms, have an evident impact on the policy making – and therefore on the economic credibility, stability and growth – of the European Union and its Member States. I greatly welcome this document, aimed at asking the Commission for legislative proposals to introduce elements of the revised European Statistics Code of Practice into EU law, because it calls for the independence and transparency of the statistical authorities to be strengthened, nationally and at European level, and asks Eurostat to simplify its reports and publications in order to become more user-friendly and accessible to all EU citizens. I believe that clear, independent and transparent data gathering and publication provide a solid basis – and the most important starting point – for fair and balanced law making.</p>

It should be recalled that the submission of statistics is a key element of the European Semester and that one of the directives making up the ‘six-pack’ sets out the requirements applicable to the budgetary frameworks of the Member States. As such, I agree with the rapporteur with regard to the need to ensure the independence of the national statistics councils from the executive, to the need to harmonise the methods of obtaining and presenting results to the greatest extent possible, and to the need to improve auditing mechanisms, in order that we might guarantee the maximum quality and transparency of governments’ financial statistics.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Statistics constitute an essential technique that is the basis for the majority of scientific work and supported decision making. When we have better information available to us about a given subject, we are able to make more appropriate and assertive decisions. This report, by Mr Scicluna, analyses the document on quality management for European statistics. The Member States of the European Union need credible and thorough statistics if they are to be able to adopt correct and effective social, economic and budgetary policy. The crisis in the euro area has demonstrated the shortcomings of the existing statistics and we can, in some cases, talk about statistical fraud. It is therefore crucial that the Member States comply scrupulously with the recommendations and legal provisions in this regard with a view to good governance. I welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted, since I believe that the measures therein, as well as modernising the data-collection system, introduce mechanisms and protective barriers, thereby preventing failures and making statistics independent of the political process. The success of the economic governance package, the Stability and Growth Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy require statistics of the highest quality.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report focuses on a number of correct objectives and principles regarding the processing and collection of economic statistics, such as independence and autonomy, making the Member States responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of statistical data. However, the rapporteur does not avoid getting caught up in his own contradictions. In particular, when asserting the need to safeguard the independence of statistical services from the threat of potential political interference, at both national and European level, he ends up arguing that statistics should produce the data used for monitoring the results of economic governance and the ‘six-pack’, which are nothing more than grave political impositions and attacks on Member State sovereignty in areas key to determining their peoples’ collective futures.</p>
      <p sl="pt">For our part, we believe that statistical indicators should provide as much knowledge and information as possible concerning social and economic realities. Moreover, they should not be selected with a view to pursuing political objectives, particularly when these run completely counter to the defence of development, well-being and social progress.</p>

The resolution includes recommendations on how to guarantee the quality and reliability of data and coordinated activity by the EU’s statistical office and the Member States’ statistical offices, by coordinating many standards and methodologies. I believe that we must reduce to the minimum the possibility of any Member State publishing imprecise or incorrect national statistical data. We are still experiencing the consequences of such action today in the case of Greece. Similarly, we must put an end to the situation where individual indicators, such as growth in GDP, can vary significantly between Member States because of differences in methodology. Data must be comparable and must reflect the corresponding economic situation, so that macro-economic shortcomings may be remedied in good time and so that fiscal policies may be developed in the EU which ensure stability and remove the threat of economic recession. It is in Latvia’s interests to have a stable Europe that can buy our goods, and a responsible policy on the part of other states in formulating budgets will help to ensure this.

      <p sl="en">In favour. This is a non-controversial report that highlights a certain number of highly consensual recommendations made by the European Parliament in order to enhance the quality management of economic statistics, including the following main elements:</p>
      <p sl="en">gradual transition is recommended from a corrective approach to a preventive approach to the quality management of European statistics in general and public finance statistics in particular;</p>
      <p sl="en">the Commission is urged to forward proposals for legislation aimed at introducing elements of the revised European Statistics Code of Practice into EU law, with a view to distinguishing clearly between the responsibilities and competences of national statistical agencies and those of Member State governments;</p>
      <p sl="en">Eurostat is encouraged to disclose publicly whether it has doubts concerning the accuracy across all types of statistics;</p>
      <p sl="en">Eurostat is urged to look at ways to make its publications, particularly those online, more user-friendly to the average citizen and non-professionals, especially with regard to the use of graphs; Eurostat’s website should, in particular, allow easier access to complete long-term data series and include intuitive comparative graphs (green input).</p>

      <p sl="it">Eurostat has existed for nearly 60 years – since 1953 to be exact. It is an especially important office for the European Union, since reliable and accurate statistics are essential to allow effective economic and budgetary policy making by Member States and at Union level. This vote underscores the need to adopt a systemic approach to quality, which may require a reform of the method of producing European statistics. This has to be achieved without increasing costs. Indeed, we need to modernise the European statistics production methods in order to maintain cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, our approval goes towards safeguarding the credibility of statistical data and the absolute independence of the statistics body.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The current European sovereign debt crisis, the implementation of our objectives for 2020, and the necessity of ensuring long-term economic growth and development at both micro- and macro-regional level all call for a coordinated, carefully planned EU economic policy backed by solid data. It is clear that actions intended to lay the foundations of the EU’s long-term economic development can only be based on accurate, objective figures that cannot be influenced by political entities. To this end, it is important for both the Member States and Eurostat to put accurate and reliable data at the disposal of political decision makers and the populace. This is a precondition of monitoring economic and demographic trends and of the ability to adjust any actions that prove to be deficient in due course. It is crucial for the Court of Auditors to review statistics submitted by Eurostat and the Member States, undertake regular financial audits, and use their expertise in the field to offer professional assistance on demand. In light of the above, I can only support this motion.</p>

      <p sl="en">The only way to have good economic policy in a country is if you can rely upon the quality of the statistics you are basing decisions upon. While there has been a lot of discussion over Greece’s use of inaccurate statistics in reporting to the European Commission, there is a more pressing concern in many countries that statistical agencies are not properly independent from government and are overly influenced by politicians to produce favourable forecasts and statistics to back up questionable economic decisions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am really supportive of Mr Scicluna’s report in this area as it reinforces the economic governance legislation that we concluded last year and looks to achieve meaningful, practical improvements to how statistics are collected and how they are used.</p>
      <p sl="en">I continually ask both the Commission in its impact assessments, and private sector organisations when they are criticising EU legislation, to back up their arguments with facts and data, and I hold Member States to the same goal – good policy can only be made if it is based upon solid evidence that stands up to scrutiny.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Commission has published a communication, the purpose of which is ‘to set out a strategy that would give the European Union a quality management framework for statistics related to enhanced economic policy coordination’. As such, I voted for this report, because I believe that a systemic approach to quality European statistics should be adopted, that a more proactive approach to managing and evaluating data on the public finances at an early stage should be encouraged, and that greater rigour in statistics should be emphasised at all levels of government. I also believe that Eurostat should modernise its methods for producing European statistics, so as to maintain the cost/efficiency relationship, and to ensure that accounting and publishing systems are standardised across the various Member States, using internal and external auditing methods for oversight. Finally, I should like to stress the need to develop a coherent system for researching socio-economic processes in cross-border areas, including the outermost regions, with a view to obtaining a reliable, complete and precise economic framework for regional development.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on quality management for European statistics because independent, high-quality statistics are needed to guarantee economic growth and employment. Users of statistics must have access to relevant, accurate and timely data which are collected and compiled by national agencies in accordance with the principles of impartiality, objectivity and professional independence. Accurate data provide a basis for obtaining detailed information and analysing areas such as demographics, the economy and the environment. This is why they play a key role in the decision-making process affecting regional development. Eurostat publications, particularly those online, need to be more user-friendly for the average citizen and non-professionals. Eurostat’s website should allow easier access to complete data and include intuitive, comparative graphs in order to provide the public with greater added value and clarity. Member States should ensure that statistics are accurate across every level of government. We encourage Eurostat to disclose publicly whether it has doubts about the accuracy of any type of statistics. We call on the Commission and Member States to take the measures required to enhance Eurostat’s independence, including amendments to its institutional status.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The report rightly observes that reliable statistics are essential for effective policy making at Member State and Union level. I believe that statistics should be publicly accessible and easily understandable by both policy makers and citizens. They should also be fair and unbiased. The greatest problem in Lithuania today is the difference between what official statistics say about economic activity and how people perceive their living conditions. Often, this difference stems not from the poor quality of official statistics, but from their inappropriate use. This can lead to biased analysis and inappropriate policy objectives, and may damage both confidence in political action and the functioning of Lithuanian democracy. For example, although the Lithuanian Government and its statistics point to economic recovery and improvement, the reality is rather different. The latest report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has revealed that in recent years, satisfaction with life in Lithuania has fallen by 10%. The report states that young Lithuanians’ confidence in a better future has also fallen by 20%. We must restore confidence and we can only achieve this if political actions – supported by unbiased statistics – have a tangible impact on people’s lives.</p>

As this report also establishes more user-friendly publications to help citizens understand statistics, I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I strongly support the report on quality management for European statistics. This is one of the prerequisites for the European Union to be able to increase its level of supervision over the budgets of individual Member States. We have had negative experiences with blatant cases of false statistics concerning levels of public debt, as in the case of Greece. Eurostat, which has been in existence since 1953, has therefore rightly gained new powers. These changes should improve the situation in two respects. Firstly, users of statistics will receive more accurate and timely data. Secondly, statistical data will become more readily available to citizens and more easily understood by them. The report therefore deserves our support.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report highlights objectives and principles that we advocate regarding the processing and collection of economic statistics; specifically, that their production should be independent and separate from the political process, making the Member States responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of statistical data. The report also mentions the need to safeguard the independence of statistical services from the threat of potential political interference, at both national and European level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, a number of the report’s other premises totally contradict these principles, particularly when it mentions that statistics should produce the data used for monitoring the results of economic governance and the ‘six-pack’, which are nothing more than policies associated with the leaders of the European institutions and the governments that back them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We would argue that statistical indicators should be at the service of a full knowledge of social and economic realities and that they should not be selected with a view to pursuing political objectives, particularly when these run completely counter to defending the development of social progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, honourable Members, Commissioner, in a world where the Internet has become a basic tool in almost all parts of our lives, including political life, the way it is used and its impact on societies and individuals is of increasing interest to us all. Frankly, it is hard to imagine a world without the Internet and the Internet constitutes a vital tool when it comes to exchange of information.</p>
      <p sl="en">Today’s debate is very important, touching upon two of the most fundamental principles of the European Union: freedom of expression and non-discrimination in an open and secure Europe. As the Presidency, we are very much aware of the concerns of this Parliament when it comes to the possible misuse of Internet sites and of the specific reasons which have led this debate to be placed on your agenda this week.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that while discussing this issue, we must distinguish between law and politics and, legally speaking, it goes without saying that there is freedom of expression in Europe. It is a cornerstone in our democracy and must be cherished. It is clearly stated in the Charter and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Human Rights that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the right to hold opinions and receive and impart information and ideas.</p>
      <p sl="en">I need not remind you that, according to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, the Union shall accede to the Convention on Human Rights. This debate also relates to the principle of free movement of workers, which is a pillar of the European Union. However, freedom of expression is not equivalent to the right to express anything about everyone. Freedom of expression should be exercised within a certain framework in order to protect other fundamental rights. So, establishing this framework can be brought about by legal remedies in national legal orders and, to some extent, also at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="en">Politically speaking however, I want to make it quite clear that I and the Danish Presidency condemn any form of discrimination. The Council also cherishes the principle of non-discrimination and all activities of the Councils are carried out in respect of this fundamental principle.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope you will understand that my comments this afternoon are necessarily brief and limited in scope. That is because the Council has neither discussed nor adopted a position on the issue of government reactions to Internet sites which raise questions concerning discrimination. As far as any specific comments this Parliament has in relation to reactions from any particular Member State, it is not for me representing the Council as a whole to take a view on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, finding the right balance between freedom of expression and non-discrimination is a very important task and I very much look forward to hearing your views on this issue.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the Commission has serious concerns about the website launched by the Dutch PVV Party and, as you know, I have personally condemned this website because it is an open call for intolerance and intolerance has no place in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">I called on all citizens of the Netherlands not to follow the intolerance of the PVV website and I commend the very strong reaction that they have shown. The Dutch complaints bureau for discrimination on the Internet has received well over 6 000 complaints from citizens and, in addition, many political parties in the Netherlands, including those from the majority, have dissociated themselves from this website.</p>
      <p sl="en">The response by Dutch business leaders is particularly welcome. They have condemned the xenophobic nature of the website and warned about its damaging effects on intra-EU trade for the Dutch economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also applaud the fact that the European parties have raised their voice. I cannot quote all those who have been very outspoken on this, but the President of the EPP has said ‘I am angered’; ALDE has said that the website goes against all European values of dignity and liberty. President Martin Schulz has given his analysis that the website shows completely unacceptable behaviour. I would like to recall that ten ambassadors have written an open letter in which they express their concerns about the discriminatory and stigmatising nature of the website, saying it was a deplorable initiative. I would like to quote the Council of Europe’s Secretary-General, who wrote that he is concerned because the website is hosted by a political party which is linked to the governing coalition, and so on and so forth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me add to this that it is unacceptable that EU citizens should become the target of xenophobic and intolerant attitudes because they have exercised their fundamental freedom to move from one Member State to another. The citizens of the 27 Member States have the right to move, work and study wherever they like and they should feel at home no matter where they decide to move. All governments have the duty to ensure that EU citizens from other Member States feel welcome. They must explain to their citizens the important benefits the free movement of citizens has for the economy and for our societies.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Framework Decision on combating Racism and Xenophobia obliges Member States to make intentional public incitement to hatred against persons punishable. Incitement to xenophobic hate is an offence in Europe, so it is for the Dutch authorities to investigate fully the lawfulness of this website under Dutch law and under Union law. I applaud the joint motion for a resolution by the PPE, the Socialist Group, the Liberals, the Greens and the Communists. That is the right way to proceed: to say altogether, ‘no, there is a limit to what one can do’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is founded on the values of democracy, non-discrimination and the rule of law. These have to be respected by all, including by national politicians.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Vice-President Reding, thank you for being here and thank you, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council for attending this sitting. This afternoon, we are talking about racism and discrimination. These are serious issues, but they are clearly not serious enough in the eyes of the Dutch Prime Minister for him to come and debate them with us. Nevertheless, it is because of a partner in his parliamentary majority that we are forced to hold this debate today. Over and above his empty chair politics, I regret, above all, that the Dutch Prime Minister is refusing to distance himself from a website that is racist, violent and misleading.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, it is wrong, first and foremost, to say that European workers do not contribute to the Dutch economy. Throughout Europe, the economy has benefited from the mobility of workers from Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ladies and gentlemen, although it is not perfect, the internal market, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of the pillars of Europe and there is absolutely no doubt that Dutch companies have benefited from it over those 20 years, as have companies from other countries, and that they have taken advantage of the Central and Eastern European market. Indeed, since 1993, those companies have invested more than EUR 23 billion in Poland, they are the largest investors in Romania and I congratulate them on that. However, beyond the economy, I ask the following question in particular: what message is the Dutch Prime Minister sending when he refuses to condemn the PVV website? That the single market is only for goods and services, and not for workers, men and women? That there are good and bad workers, depending on the passport they hold?</p>
      <p sl="fr">The internal market is not a one-way street. Its rules apply to everyone alike. They apply to services, to financial transactions and to workers. I will say it again: Europe is not just a single market; it is also and, above all, a community of values.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We know only too well that discrimination, racism and xenophobia led to the darkest pages of our history. Here among us are Members whose parents fought and died to liberate Europe and the Netherlands 60 years ago. Can we in all good conscience remain silent and fail to respond to the incitement to hatred of certain parties? I will simply repeat what the Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke said: ‘All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) reiterates its moral appeal to the Dutch Prime Minster to condemn the offending website clearly and quickly and, like Ms Reding, I am very pleased that here in this Parliament, the democrats have tabled a joint motion.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is true that it was not a question but a statement. I must say that it was a silly statement. Let us now speak on the real subject.</p>
      <p sl="de">For many years and even decades, we have been attempting to create a new Europe with as few borders as possible. A Europe in which everyone feels at home, in particular, as Mr Daul mentioned, our fellow Europeans, the citizens of Eastern Europe, following the fall of the iron curtain. For the members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, there is only one Europe. Whether people come from the east, west, north or south, they are all inhabitants of this continent and they deserve our respect. They are all people who can make mistakes and who may occasionally create an unpleasant impression in their neighbourhood. However, there is no difference between the people from the eastern and central parts of Europe and those from the west.</p>
      <p sl="de">We want to create a Europe of this kind with all the fundamental freedoms and with the opportunity to work anywhere in the continent. The developments that have taken place in this area are very poor. We have already discussed this today in the context of the threat of suspending the Schengen Agreement. The previous Danish Government suddenly expressed the desire to close its borders. Quite apart from the fact that it currently holds the Presidency of the European Council, I am very grateful to the current Danish Government for reversing this decision.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is one government which is continuing to prevent Romania and Bulgaria from joining the Schengen Area. This happens to be the Dutch Government. Quite by chance, this is the same government which is working together with the party that has created this dreadful website. I can only repeat what Mr Daul has already said on the subject, because despite all our differences, Parliament must take a joint approach. This website is totally unacceptable and goes against all our European values. It must be shut down by the people responsible, who should realise that this is intolerable.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, the most unacceptable aspect of all this is the failure of the Dutch Government and the Dutch Prime Minister to react. He recently said to me in the course of a conversation that it was not their website and it would be even better if a government were to set up a website like this. Nevertheless, this is a party which is cooperating with him. It may not be a formal alliance, perhaps it is an informal one, but in any case, they have a relationship. They are sleeping in the same bed. The government should not be doing this with a party which creates a website of this kind. Therefore, I can only say once again to Prime Minister Rutte: we are waiting. We are still waiting for you to distance yourself from this. We do not want you to call in the police to close it down if this is against the law, as Ms Reding has said. However, we are waiting for Mr Rutte to make a clear political statement indicating that he is opposed to the citizens of the European Union being treated in this way and that he also opposes racism and discrimination.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with Ms Reding – even though you did not mention one of the first statements by the S&amp;D Group, but that is not what we are discussing – that it is important for us to take a joint approach in this matter. It is important for our group and the entire House to stand up against racism and discrimination in Europe. Mr Rutte should take note of this and he should respond to this call.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, my group has nothing but contempt for Mr Wilders’s initiative. We made that clear straight away. It is really unacceptable and it is a disgrace that something like this is still possible today in the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, that initiative did not just come out of nowhere. That initiative was no accident. The actual reason for this initiative by Mr Wilders’s party lies in the sudden collapse in his party’s support in the opinion polls in early January and a subsequent loss of seven seats. It was, indeed, the first time that this had ever happened to Mr Wilders’s party. The reason why that happened is quite simple. Mr Wilders was simply unable to stop carping at people. He heaped criticism on Queen Beatrix for wearing a headscarf during a state visit to Oman. He started attacking her and Wilders’s criticism of their queen did not go down very well with the Dutch, and rightly so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And, so, what did Mr Wilders do? He immediately tried another tack with another issue. This time, the target was not the Royal Family; this time, it was the Eastern Europeans. He opened a complaints website where people could complain about the presence in the Netherlands of Poles, Slovaks, Bulgarians and other Eastern Europeans. That is the real reason why this complaints website was set up.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That said, I totally agree with Mr Daul that the Dutch Government’s silence was, in fact, unacceptable. Whether or not this is a party question, as the Dutch Government claims, is, in fact, irrelevant. I think that we all have the right to know what the Dutch authorities actually think of an initiative established by one of its illustrious citizens somewhere on its territory.</p>
      <p sl="nl">What I can tell you, Mr Daul, is that I have, at any rate, personally tackled Prime Minister Rutte over this.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that you do the same thing with Mr Maxime Verhagen because, as you know, it is not just Mr Rutte’s position; it is a position of the Dutch Government and, thus, of the two parties in power. It would be wise for you, too, to intervene to encourage the Dutch Government to take a position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Indeed, we also know that what is happening in the Netherlands is not an isolated event at present. There is something more serious going on in Europe. When I see, for example, your candidate for the French Presidency saying that half of all immigrants should leave the country, stigmatising the Muslim community, threatening his European partners and jeopardising the Schengen acquis , I have to tell you that that language and behaviour are unacceptable today, too. As I said this morning, I wonder who really is the far right candidate: him or Ms Le Pen?</p>
      <p sl="fr">In any event, what we must not do, and what we have not done with the resolution, is hide things here. When things happen in the Netherlands, we must denounce them. When things happen in France, we must denounce them. When things happen in Hungary, we must denounce them, too, together!</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card question. – Madam President, my question to Mr Verhofstadt is why does he refer only to the very important aspect of it, which is xenophobic racism, but does not refer to the data protection aspect? I recall how fiercely he attacked Prime Minister Orbán on one of the three legislative issues in this Chamber on data protection. What is happening in the Netherlands is a violation of the Data Protection Directive of 1995, just as much as it was invoked vis-à-vis the Hungarian Prime Minister.

I hope that the Dutch Government is not just quiet on this for the moment but that they are examining this problem, based on the rules that exist in Holland and, at the same time, based on the rules that exist in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">For me, this case is not closed – on the contrary – and for me also, the response that was given by Ms Reding is not the end. I want there to be a follow-up on this and I want there to be a clear statement from the political side in Holland that this is not tolerable at all, based on the legislation on data protection – and because they have received a number of complaints from individuals about other citizens living in Europe and in Holland – and, at the same time, based also on the other legislation in Europe.</p>

However, the fact remains that the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is part of your EP group and part of the ruling Dutch coalition, the government which is failing to distance itself from this despicable initiative. Have you asked the VVD to put pressure on Mr Rutte and, if so, what was the answer?</p>

I cannot help noticing, however, that the coalition party in the Netherlands does not appear to have had the courage to do so.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is not the first time I have said that here. Three days ago, I was in Amsterdam, where I gave a speech at the launch of Hans van Mierlo’s book, ‘An Insane Adventure’, and where I said that the silence at the Catshuis – the residence of the Dutch Prime Minister in the Hague – was, in fact, unacceptable. However, the position of both liberal parties in my group has been made very clear, including that of the VVD and of Mr van Baalen.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, a Polish MEP recently said that more Dutch people should see the film ‘The Lives of Others’, because then they would understand how immensely hurtful it is for people who have lived behind the Iron Curtain to learn that a complaints website exists calling on people to snitch on their fellow citizens.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This website stigmatises and stereotypes workers from Central and Eastern Europe and panders to discrimination against them. The outcry there has been over this website has not been without reason. The Dutch Government’s policy choices have been gradually filling a chalice with bad blood: the exclusion of Romanian and Bulgarian workers, the blocking of Schengen, the restriction of the social rights of EU citizens. And this website is the last drop that has made the chalice run over.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This debate is not about the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), nor is it about Geert Wilders, though he would very much like that to be the case. His despicable initiative is an attempt to provoke and nothing more than that. This debate is about the position of Prime Minister Rutte, a prime minister who is neglecting his responsibilities. It is his responsibility to condemn this website in the strongest terms, because it is stigmatising EU citizens, and he is neglecting to do that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is Mr Rutte’s responsibility to protect the citizens of his country from discrimination and to address the causes thereof and he is neglecting that responsibility. It is Mr Rutte’s responsibility to accord paramount importance to the fundamental European right of free movement and he is neglecting to do that. Prime Minister Rutte has forced himself into a corner by repeatedly stating that he has no intention of condemning the website. And he seems to think that it would be a defeat to retrace his steps while he still has time.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On Thursday, we will be adopting a resolution here, by an overwhelming majority, in which we make it clear that Prime Minister Rutte’s failure to condemn the website will be an even greater defeat, for him, for the Netherlands’ reputation and, actually, for all Europeans. If Mr Rutte wants to be a prime minister who does business with the big boys and big girls of Europe, then he needs to be seen to address the consequences of this website and his government’s policies, like a real man. If he fails to do so, then his name will look totally in place on that illustrious list that is in the making: Berlusconi, Orbán, Rutte.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card question. – Ms Cornelissen, I have listened to you very carefully. You compare the situation with the film ‘The Lives of Others’, a film which is about the communist dictatorship in East Germany, where people were spied on because of their political opinions and where a dissident political opinion could lead to imprisonment, losing one’s job, consequences for one’s children, etc.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Blimey! Do you really think it is reasonable to compare that situation in a totalitarian society with a website calling on people to report, not the presence of Eastern European nationals, but criminal offences committed by them? It is my view that one really does not bear any comparison whatsoever with the other, but do you beg to differ?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Blue-card answer. – Madam President, the question was put to me, so I will answer it. Mr Vanhecke has given a very good demonstration of how hurtful it must be for people from Central and Eastern Europe to know that such a website exists. Life under communism was hell and, for these people, the fact that that kind of system of snitching has once again been set up conjures up memories of those times, which continue to make their lives hell.</p>
      <p sl="nl">And, of course, the film and the website are not strictly comparable, but the feelings the latter provokes are . We politicians must also take into account the feelings we generate. And, indeed, as Mr Verhofstadt has already said: if you have a criminal act to report, then you should go to the police, and that is what you should do, regardless of whether the criminal is a Dutchman/Dutchwoman or an Eastern or Central European.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Dutch electoral law unfortunately allows the existence of political parties which do not have any members. This means that the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) consists of one man, Geert Wilders. Wilders is the PVV. In French and English-speaking regions, they immediately and very transparently saw through this. It is, therefore, true what they say: P, double V equals PW equals the Wilders Party.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The great leader Wilders saw the light one day and uttered these impressive words: things are not going well in the Netherlands, they have to change! Putting his money where his mouth was, he became the only member of the new party ‘P double V’, the Wilders Party. Le parti, c’est moi!</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Wilders Party has only one member and it also has only one policy: things have to change. Therefore, roughly every three months, Mr Wilders starts taking direct pot shots at some random target: the Moroccans, the Turks, the Greeks, Queen Beatrix, ritual slaughter, the euro. Hmm, who has not had a thrashing yet from the great leader Wilders? Today, it is the Poles and Eastern Europeans. Tomorrow, it will be you or me!</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is what this whole thing amounts to, Madam President – nothing more and nothing less. The great leader Wilders thinks that things have to change and, time and again, he throws a tantrum to vent his frustrations. I believe we are showing too much respect to the P double V party by devoting a debate to it in this House. Certainly, when we recall that a debate here costs tens of thousands of euro per hour, we could have put that money to better use. I quote, with consent, the P double V donor Mr Hartong: ‘This is a joke’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, today’s debate would not have been necessary if Prime Minister Rutte had immediately and unhesitatingly distanced himself from that website. He ought to have condemned the website straight away, because it encourages the intimidation and stigmatisation of a large group of people. Such a condemnation was all the more necessary because Mr Rutte depends on the support of the Wilders Party as a reluctantly tolerated junior partner in his government. In addition, the Prime Minister ought to have, in the same breath, praised the daily contributions of many Poles and Eastern Europeans to the Dutch economy. And I say that on behalf of my group in general but, in particular, on behalf of the Polish, Czech, Latvian, Lithuanian and Hungarian members of my group.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If Prime Minister Rutte had immediately expressed that condemnation, then we would have been able to have made more constructive use of our precious time here today.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, today we are holding a debate on a Dutch website that openly incites hatred and xenophobia against Eastern European workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Do you have problems with Eastern European immigrants? Have you lost your job to a Pole, a Bulgarian, a Romanian or other Eastern European? We want to know. That is what you can read on the site. That leaves us speechless; it is incitement to racial hatred. It also seems that the website is receiving more than 10 000 complaints per day.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is the work of a far-right party – which would be serious enough in itself – but, as has already been said, it is, in fact, a member of the parliamentary coalition that supports the current Dutch Government, which is refusing to condemn it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Danish Presidency and the Commission have just condemned this initiative, but you continue to refer the matter back to the Member States and their courts. I thought that the Commission was the Guardian of the Treaties, and that free movement and non-discrimination were European Union values. It seems that some values are more important than others, and when it comes to economic matters, when it comes to the free movement of goods or capital or barriers to competition, the Commission is much quicker to condemn. How do you expect the citizens not to wonder about the European Union’s real values?</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is worse, however. Similar practices are developing in many Member States. In Poland, two far-right sites cite a jumbled list of left-wing activists, homosexuals and foreigners as enemies of the race. In Latvia, Russians are targeted because of their registration plates. In both Poland and Latvia, very personal information is circulated about the people concerned. In Luxembourg, a law restricting foreign residents’ access to family allowances has just been adopted. We have already talked about Hungary and Mr Verhofstadt spoke about France. Indeed, our campaigning President of the Republic, after attacking the Roma, wants to hold referenda on immigration and is undermining the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">All of this is intolerable. It brings back sad memories, and not just in Eastern Europe. We cannot content ourselves with fine rhetoric; we must take action. It is high time that we did.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the beautiful town of Maastricht is located in the Netherlands. The Treaty on European Union was signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992. One of its key provisions talked about creating an area without internal frontiers. Freedom to travel and freedom to choose the country where you want to live and work were some of the cornerstones of the success of the European Union. It is all the more regrettable that it is precisely in the Netherlands that a draconian violation of the European Union’s fundamental principles has occurred. This violation is the portal of Geert Wilders’s PVV party, on which it is possible to post complaints against the behaviour of immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, with no fear of retribution. I want to state clearly that I have no objection to stigmatising the behaviour of thieves, hooligans, vandals or thugs, but because they are thieves, hooligans, vandals or thugs, and not because they are Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians or representatives of any other nation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must make it clear that this portal awakens evil demons. It brings to mind the familiar tragedies of the 20th century with concepts of ethnic exclusion and second-class citizens. I come from a country where the Germans once murdered 6 million people and, in some places, there were signs saying nur für Deutsche – German citizens only. Are we about to see signs in the Netherlands saying ‘Dutch citizens only’? I am asking because the lack of a definite response from the Dutch Government on this matter is an absolute scandal. I understand that the Prime Minister of the Netherlands is hostage to the Freedom Party, but the fundamental values of the European Union must not be sacrificed on the altar of any political interest. This portal breaches three directives: the Anti-Discrimination Directive, the directive on freedom of movement, and the directive on personal data protection.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I demand a strong reaction from the European Parliament and, as a Pole and as an MEP from Poland – a country which shed blood for the liberation of the Netherlands at Arnhem under Generals Maczek and Sosabowski – I urge the European Parliament to condemn unequivocally this outrageous portal and to put pressure on the government of the Netherlands to force it to close this portal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, eight years ago, no fewer than 12 countries joined the European Union. Everyone knew then only too well that those countries were not ready to join. The ambition was to create not a stable EU, but, first and foremost, a large EU. The accession requirements were simply relaxed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The consequence of that is that already, three hundred thousand people from Central and Eastern Europe have moved to the Netherlands. The reality is that the sheer numbers of these people are causing major problems in terms of housing, employment, education and social security. Unfortunately, this has also been accompanied by a large increase in crime and a massive burden on our society.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yes, Madam President, this is the reality, one we have found out about through the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV)’s website, which has already received more than a hundred thousand complaints.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Brussels elite is partly responsible for the relocation of crime to the Netherlands, and the overburdening of services that this entails, because of its open-borders policy. The free movement of persons, yes, but this has also been accompanied by the free movement of crime and the concomitant social burden. The Dutch are bothered by it and have had enough. And they are not alone. France is having the same problems and now even the French President, Sarkozy, is threatening to suspend French membership of the Schengen area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Meanwhile, Madam President, we are having a plenary debate here, but not about the problems, as our citizens would expect. No, we are having a debate about PVV’s website which is trying to map those problems. This is a world turned upside down. This Parliament is sweeping the problems under the carpet, this Parliament – including its President – does not want to know the facts. We are listening to our citizens. It is you, not we, who are walking away from the problems!</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Brussels elite in the Commission and Parliament sees only the European dream, when, in reality, it appears to be turning into a nightmare, like a bubble bursting, but they do not actually want to know anything about this. They are like squabbling children who are throwing a tantrum now that there are no more presents to open. They can now shed their mask of moral superiority because our citizens have seen through it. Madam President, it is time that this Parliament was abolished.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in the name of the Commission, let me call on the Netherlands authorities to take all appropriate measures to fully assess the lawfulness of this website and to draw the necessary consequences.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Netherlands authorities have to look into the matter from different angles. First, the framework decision against racism and xenophobia. The national courts have the responsibility to determine according to the concrete circumstances and context whether a concrete situation represents an incitement to violence or hatred on the basis of race, colour, religion, descent, national or ethnic origin. I want to make it clear that the Commission cannot replace the assessment of the relevant criminal judge at national level. Second, their national laws on hate speech on the Internet. Third, there are national laws implementing the 1995 Data Protection Directive. Here, it is the Dutch data protection authority which is responsible for taking action in order to analyse the initiative, to investigate whether an unlawful processing of personal data is taking place and to take the necessary steps to correct this.</p>
      <p sl="en">This debate was about the unacceptable behaviour of a political party, the reputation of a national government, the rights of individuals to exercise their rights and obligations linked to the Free Movement Directive, the rules commonly agreed by all governments to protect all Europeans, and the values – everything we believe in and everything on which we are constructing our common future.</p>

Many important issues and problems have been touched on today and, as President-in-Office of the Council, I have taken note of your opinions and concerns. I would like to reiterate that the Council has not had an opportunity to discuss the question of the Member States’ handling of Internet sites. However, I would also like to make it absolutely clear today that the Council obviously fully upholds the principle that it should not be possible for any EU citizen to be discriminated against on account of his or her origin. That is an absolutely fundamental principle. It is a basic building block of the EU. It is an element of our shared values and history. I therefore expect all Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the fundamental rights of all EU citizens are respected and enforced. This applies both in relation to discrimination and in relation to the freedom of expression.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I want to express my concern about the website launched on the initiative of the PVV party, on which complaints about people from Central and Eastern Europe living and working in the Netherlands can be posted. This website breaches the European principle of freedom. Under Articles 15 and 45 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, citizens have a right to freedom of movement, to engage in work and to study. The portal breaches the principle of a dialogue. It is one-sided and subjective in its assessment. It is aimed directly at a specific group of people and incites hatred.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Let us not forget that citizens of Central and Eastern Europe working in the Netherlands also participate in building the Dutch economy. As a Pole and a citizen of Europe, who knows its history, I would point out that many Polish soldiers died for the freedom of the Netherlands during World War Two. The soldiers under General Stanisław Maczek of the First Armoured Division deserve to be mentioned, who, after heavy fighting, liberated many Dutch towns, such as Breda, without civilian casualties. At that time, the residents did not spare their words of appreciation and gestures of gratitude to the Poles for the considered tactics which avoided the destruction of their homes and monuments. In the windows of Dutch homes, there were signs in Polish reading ‘Thank you, Poles’. We are building a Europe in which all citizens should be treated equally, and I appeal for this pursuant to Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I am not greatly surprised by the initiative from the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) because this is just one in a series of such actions intended to stigmatise certain groups of immigrants, which is something that we have become used to from the European far right for some time. However, I am indeed surprised by the muted response of the Dutch Government to this initiative which tramples on the European Union’s values by inciting intolerance and discrimination. Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are fully-fledged EU Member States, and their citizens must be treated as such and not as some second-class citizens. The free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom enshrined in the Treaty which the Netherlands has signed. This is therefore a freedom which the Netherlands must respect and facilitate at all times, not only when Dutch companies have access to the markets of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Nevertheless, I do not support the call for a boycott of Dutch products made by some of my colleagues because this goes against the principles of the internal market and because I firmly believe that this initiative is not supported by most of Dutch society. I have even received messages of support from Dutch citizens who have clearly distanced themselves from the action taken by the PVV. However, I also expect the Dutch Government likewise to distance itself from and strongly condemn this initiative.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Dutch Government’s silence with regard to the racist website promoted by the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) proves the considerable influence that this extremist party has on the Netherlands’ European policy, especially concerning the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, the Netherlands is the only Member State which has virtually closed its labour market to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens. It is also blocking both countries’ accession to the Schengen area in an illegal and, in particular, immoral manner.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This new website, which is extremely offensive and xenophobic, is a new expression of the PVV’s anti-European sentiment which, unfortunately, is once again going unpunished by the European Commission and especially by the Dutch Government. Both the silence from the Dutch authorities and the Commission’s lack of action are unacceptable and encourage the PVV to pursue its policy of xenophobia. It would therefore not surprise us if the next initiative from the PVV was to make it compulsory for foreigners to wear distinctive badges or simply to expel them from the Netherlands. As the Guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission must not only speak out in condemnation of these initiatives, but also take concrete measures, failing a satisfactory response from the national authorities.</p>

      <p sl="hu">An acquaintance of mine sent me the following Facebook post the other day: ‘I lived in the Netherlands for 20 years. From birth, the Dutch are a very tolerant people; something like this would have been inconceivable back then. Today, this is all due to a wave of right-wing radicalism’. This was in response to the news story that the Party for Freedom, led by Geert Wilders, launched a website encouraging people to file complaints against Central and Eastern Europeans taking employment in the Netherlands. Four years ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the right-wing government of the Netherlands distanced himself from the anti-Islamic film released by Wilders’s party. Back then, the government was not yet dependant on the support of a radical, extremist party. The current right-wing minority cabinet, however, is unwilling to condemn the creation of this website. This is because its survival depends on the support it receives from Geert Wilders and his associates. The Dutch Government is perfectly aware that the 200 000 Central Europeans who have been legally employed in the Netherlands since May 2007 are not adding to existing problems but, on the contrary, contribute to the welfare of the country’s citizens. The data of Dutch economic researchers show that a Polish or Hungarian worker taking long-term employment in the Netherlands contributes an annual EUR 24 000 to treasury income. We expect the Dutch Government to not only condemn all xenophobic, hatemongering actions on the part of the Party for Freedom, as well as all forms of discrimination, but also to provide factually accurate information to the populace about how foreigners, including immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, contribute to the prosperity of their country.</p>

      <p sl="hu">We noted with regret that the Dutch Prime Minister did not attend today’s debate on the radical Dutch website that slanders Eastern European citizens. While, for partisan reasons, European liberals launch attacks against popular governments with reference to fundamental rights, the liberal Dutch Prime Minister openly collaborates with the radical Party for Freedom responsible for the website. We are deeply outraged that the website of the Party for Freedom incites the Dutch populace to file complaints against citizens from Eastern Europe based on their origin. Such acts and their tacit toleration undermine trust between Member States in times when what is needed is, in fact, reinforced solidarity. One cannot hide behind the freedom of speech when the fundamental personal rights of other citizens are being trampled underfoot. We must not tolerate such mockery of human dignity or the questioning of equality irrespective of origin. We must not tolerate open slander against Eastern European citizens. The issue of the Dutch website is not about abstract legal principles but about a specific case of practical violation of fundamental rights. Yet, despite extensive calls from the international community, the liberal Prime Minister remains unwilling to distance himself from the website. Such behaviour is detrimental to EU integration and weakens faith in our common values.</p>

      <p sl="bg">This site, which is targeted against Central and East Europeans, oversteps the boundaries of free speech, violates civil rights and creates a xenophobic atmosphere. I cannot agree that this is an internal matter concerning one party.</p>

      <p sl="bg">I hope that the Dutch Government will take measures enabling them to defend the name of its country which is one of the founding members of the EU and which was renowned, until recently, for its people’s liberal attitudes and tolerance. These are values which should not be sacrificed, whether because of economic problems, because of the rise in unemployment or of Euroscepticism, and in no way because of one party’s aspiration to gain popularity. Otherwise, a serious question mark will remain over the Dutch Government’s ability to adopt an impartial stance, both with regard to the anti-Bulgarian website and on Bulgaria’s and Romania’s membership of Schengen.</p>

I wish to thank my colleagues in the European Parliament because they have supported us by condemning this initiative. Many governments and parties pretend to forget that East European workers have made a significant contribution to Western countries’ economies. I have felt, right from the start, that the European Commission must take an official stance, given that the basic EU principles on the free movement of workers are being violated. There are many statements being made in Europe which ought to be raising question marks. We are all aware of what the European Union’s values are. Doubts are increasingly being cast over the freedom to travel and work. The populism being demonstrated by some parties only helps perpetuate a feeling of insecurity both among the European citizens working and living in a particular Member State and among the citizens of that state.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Today, five years after Bulgaria and Romania were admitted to the European family, displays of discrimination and racism are still permitted against citizens from these countries. One example of this is the website created by the Dutch PVV Party for making complaints about Eastern Europeans. This action is detrimental to Europe’s future because it disseminates racism and xenophobia, and it must be condemned straightaway.</p>
      <p sl="bg">European citizenship is a symbol of free movement within Member States, granting the right of establishment within the EU. This is why the assertion that Bulgarians are taking the jobs of Dutch citizens is groundless and goes against fundamental European values. I wish to point out that the Netherlands labour market is also completely closed to citizens from these two countries. In November 2011, the European Commission published a report highlighting the positive impact the mobility of Bulgarian and Romanian workers was having on the European economy. This is yet further proof that the creators of the website are not dealing with real facts, but are relying on populist tactics.</p>
      <p sl="bg">I call on the European Commission and the Dutch Prime Minister to implement swift, effective measures in condemning the website in question and taking the necessary legal steps to close it down. Eastern Europe is waiting for a clear signal that such displays of discrimination will not be tolerated in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">There has been an alarming and accelerating increase in the amount of discriminatory online content in the past few years. According to the estimates of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, there are approximately ten thousand online groups, blogs, chat rooms, videos and games that were created by racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic persons, the most serious of which are, of course, those operated by terrorist groups and other criminal associations. The Commission and Member States must consider developing a code of conduct for combating online incitement of hatred, and modifying their legislation to effectively respond to the new challenges of information technology. First, those websites that are fundamentally discriminatory in nature or instigate crimes need to be shut down; the national and international procedural rules for doing this need to be properly established. Second, discriminatory content appearing in mainstream websites and, most typically, in social networks must also be rejected. Although these pages have so many visitors that supervising them is almost impossible, authorities need to reach agreements with content providers and server hosts to at least limit such activities. Third, it must be considered that certain websites might be discriminatory by negligence, such as official and administrative pages of public interest that are non-accessible for people with disabilities.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The events currently taking place in the Netherlands are dangerous. Within the first 48 hours of this website’s launch, 22 000 complaints had already been registered. Inciting hatred and violence against all East Europeans could have harmful consequences. The Dutch Freedom Party is obviously attempting to raise its profile by adopting a provocative attitude, without thinking about the long term. However, I am shocked by the muted response of the Dutch Government and the very crass message issued in diplomatic terms by Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

      <p sl="it">We recently heard in the news of the arrests made by Unipol in the homes of thousands of Internet users, in Europe and in the United States, who were uploading and downloading images of child pornography. The solution that assisted in the investigations carried out by the police – whom I thank on behalf of the citizens who use the Internet for constructive purposes and not as a weapon to harm the most vulnerable – is called ‘protected anonymity’, meaning the ability of the provider of such services to record the real details of the user, who can surf the Internet while appearing anonymous to other users. When an offence is committed through such a connection, the user must then face their responsibilities. It is the same principle that connects vehicle owners with their registration plate. However, in contrast to our congested motorways, the Internet is the open road for free expression that, according to some opinions expressed in this House, nobody should dare to restrict, even when the matter in question is child grooming or paedophilia offences. The message we send out today is significant. I hope that Written Declaration 29, adopted on 23 June 2010, will soon receive the necessary means for its implementation, since I believe that the dignity of children is entitled to the same protection as online privacy and freedom of expression.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I think that by expressing my outrage at the content on the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV) portal, I am expressing a view held not only by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), but by the vast majority of Members of Parliament. Mr Wilders and his party argue that the large number of workers from new Member States will increase crime and cause a deterioration in the standard of living in the Netherlands. This ignores the fact that precisely this group often accepts jobs which need to be done, but which the Dutch are reluctant to do. Immigrants contribute significantly to the Dutch GDP. Urging citizens to write denunciations against workers from Central and Eastern Europe is a manifestation not only of repugnant discrimination, but also of political immaturity. If we want to build a common international order such as the EU, the introduction of divisions based on negative stereotypes within the Union shows either a lack of understanding of what the EU is and should be, or wilful conduct striving to destroy it. Regardless of the motives, which should be condemned, it is high time that Mr Wilders and other politicians who build support based on nationalist and xenophobic slogans understand that the EU’s continued stable existence requires that we speak with one voice on key issues such as tolerance and equal opportunities in employment. This is in the interests of countries such as both Poland and the Netherlands.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, we all know about the debate taking place specifically on Greece in connection with the overblown public sector and how it affects competitiveness, as that is also the subject of today’s debate.</p>
      <p sl="el">Just recently, as I am sure you know, the Troika’s latest report on the second round of economic reforms in Greece was released. There is a passage on page 36 of the report which refers to employment in the public sector.</p>
      <p sl="el">The report says that the government has stated its commitment to reducing the public sector and employment by at least 150 000 between 2010 and 2015. In order to achieve this target, it is expected to apply strictly the existing rule between incoming and outgoing staff, reduce employment contracts and transfer 15 000 to the reserve for surplus staff prior to their dismissal.</p>
      <p sl="el">I ask you directly, given that the Commission was also involved in drafting this report: is it calling for the dismissal of workers from the public sector in Greece this year as one of the measures to develop its competitiveness?</p>

      <p sl="en">As you know, the Greek situation in Europe is absolutely extraordinary and, in the last two years, the Commission has made all possible efforts, together with other European institutions – and not just European ones but also international financial institutions like the IMF – to find the right approach and to ensure that Europe as such, the economic and monetary union, becomes more stable and, in the end, also more dynamic.</p>
      <p sl="en">We can, of course, discuss various aspects of this experience in the Greek context and also in the wider European context which, in recent months, shows signs of sliding back into a kind of recession, at least in the majority of the Member States, but it is definitely a very difficult time for the ‘programme countries’.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, the key is to restore financial stability, to ensure that, after the adjustment period, there will be a return to stable financing of the real economy and then to ensure that even in such times, there is investment, and this is what the taskforce in Greece is working on.</p>
      <p sl="en">Recently, just a couple of weeks ago, we had an opportunity to meet Mr Papademos in Brussels together with the President of the Commission and some eight Commissioners working in the Greek context.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I just want to say that of course we understand what Mr Papanikolaou has just said about the demands and the severity of this national programme, as recommended by the Troika, and the difficulty involved in implementing it. As far as Greece is concerned, we are dealing with an exceptional situation that has justified exceptional measures. At the same time, the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have played their part, as have the Greek authorities, by agreeing together to extremely tough measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like to add this question, Mr Papanikolaou, to the debate that we are going to have during this Question Time on the issue of growth and competitiveness. Exceptional measures have had to be taken to get out of an exceptionally serious situation and that requires the efforts of everyone, in particular, the Greek people. I am confident that your country has real assets, with its tourism economy, which is one of the most powerful in Europe thanks to its natural, cultural and historical heritage, its extremely powerful maritime economy and its extremely important agricultural capacity. Therefore – and we will talk about this shortly – although the internal market, which is the open area for the Greek economy, functions well, I think that your country must play its part and fulfil its role in that internal market, rediscovering there the foundations for reviving its growth and its job market. That is why the Greek case, like that of other countries, is linked to what we must do to relaunch growth, employment and competitiveness within the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="el">I repeat: the Troika released a new report today which refers to the overblown public sector. What is to become of these people, these supernumeraries to whom the report refers as surplus staff? Will they be able to remain and continue to work?</p>
      <p sl="el">Commissioners, I understand what you said, but the crisis is not just a question of numbers; it concerns people. All this time, the across-the-board cuts set out in the Troika’s policy have done nothing but exacerbate the recession.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe the truth is – and there should be consensus that – a completely unsuitable financial situation developed in Greece in the pre-crisis years. The Greek economy has lots of capacities and potential, and the Greek people are actually very hard-working – we know that from the labour statistics – but the point is that this unsustainable financial situation was also partly due to the fact that too many people were employed, in an inefficient way, in the public sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">Restructuring has to take place. The efficiency and the effectiveness of public administration has to improve, partly to run the economy and the public sector as such, but also to ensure that the European assistance provided through Structural Funds can be used in a more efficient way. We have made much progress in this area. The European Social Fund was not implemented very well in earlier years, but in the last year, we have managed to double the ESF absorption rate, which not only directly helps job creation and promotes enterprise, but also helps to implement administrative reform.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also discussed this with Mr Papademos two weeks ago, when he was in Brussels. At the end of this month, I will go to Athens and see how the situation is developing on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Kallas, as competition increases in the years to come, we can expect the volume of traffic to increase even further. If we look at the figures again, it becomes clear that more than a quarter of our current CO2 emissions are produced by transport. This means that we must reduce our CO2 emissions and increase the efficiency of our transport systems. In my opinion, you have taken the right approach in your document. Your proposal for new guidelines is primarily about giving priority to environmentally friendly means of transport.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, now we come to the ‘but’, Mr Kallas. This makes it all the more incomprehensible to me that you have seriously considered permitting cross-border transport on Europe’s roads using so-called monster trucks or gigaliners.

      <p sl="en">Yes, it is a very sensitive issue. We have no intention of issuing any kind of decree or directive allowing big trucks, called ‘mega-trucks’, or ‘eco-liners’, depending on who is speaking. We have no intention of creating a directive allowing these mega-trucks to travel everywhere in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that in order to become competitive, we need to have growth, and that is the quandary we are in. There is talk of it everywhere. Even this morning in plenary, from Mr Barroso to Mr Van Rompuy, everyone was talking about growth. However, I especially wanted to quiz the two commissioners who look after infrastructures, Mr Kallas and Mr Barnier. Do you – and all my fellow Members – think that we will get out of this and quickly achieve growth using the normal methods and the budgets as before? Or do you actually think that we need to make a leap in quality in order to achieve growth? I am rapporteur for the current project bonds report, which is just a little tonic to try and give some guarantees to development companies entering the market. The question is, should we send development companies into the market, or should we, as the EU, go ourselves?</p>

      <p sl="en">Concerning the proposed bond, which could be very important for transport infrastructure, yes, I think it can work. There are two main opposing views. One of the opposing views now being discussed in Member States is a fear that this proposed bond is somehow a hidden eurobond or a bond which could increase the debt burden uncontrollably, which is not the case. It is something completely different. It is an instrument which is linked to concrete projects and is intended to involve private money.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second fear is that some Member States are simply opposed to it, and you simply have a very complicated explanation. You listen, you think and you do not understand.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are the main criticisms being voiced in this discussion, but things look promising. After discussions on the proposed bond, when and if they are completed, we will launch a pilot project. We think that we can involve more private money in these investments, which will definitely facilitate growth.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr Cancian, continuing on from what Siim Kallas has just said, if we want to take action to achieve growth and not just talk about it, my belief is that the basic platform for this growth economy that we are seeking is clearly this vast market of 500 million consumers and 22 million businesses, which needs easier communications and fewer obstacles or divisions from an administrative, fiscal or regulatory perspective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is our goal with the Single Market Act and that is why, Mr Cancian, we have identified, in the 12 levers for growth, the communications and the infrastructures that we need for energy, transport and the digital sector. That is also why the time will come – very soon, I hope – when the governments will be ready to accept project bonds because the aim is clearly to invest massively, together, in communication infrastructures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You also asked me, perhaps with reference to my responsibility, about the infrastructures of financial companies. Financial infrastructures are one of the conditions of growth. Everything that we have been doing with you for the past two years to re-establish rules, transparency, responsibility – I would also add here morals, where they had disappeared – and to get the financial services to work for the real economy and the financial infrastructures to function on sound, solid bases are also preconditions for restoring confidence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is precisely what we are doing now. I want to remind the European Parliament that, as I speak, we have given you virtually all of the texts needed to establish the regulation requested by the G20. Now you just need to take the democratic time to adopt these texts with the Council. I hope that in a few months, we will have clearly built this basis for sound, solid financial infrastructures in order to get the financial markets working for the real economy rather than for their own benefit.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is good to hear you talking about infrastructure, because investment in infrastructure is so critical to growth and competitiveness. But, Commissioner Barnier, last week, one of the UK’s largest insurance companies said they may move to Hong Kong. Then the head of the British insurance industry warned of large reductions in infrastructure investment, and a huge infrastructure owner told me their investors’ increased costs could add over 10% to every project investment. All of this is due to uncertainty regarding Solvency II, so it is a very simple question, Commissioner: please will you ask Mr Balz to stop rewriting Solvency II through the Omnibus Directive?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Ms Ford, we have naturally had many opportunities to talk, in both your committee and in plenary, about this entire regulatory agenda, which I mentioned in my answer to Mr Cancian. Naturally, as part of that agenda – which I did not invent as it came from the G20 – decisions were taken before I joined the European Commission on Basel for the banks, on Solvency for insurance, and on the revision of the Pension Funds Directive. It is my job, with you and the Council of Ministers, to put this agenda in place as intelligently and speedily as possible, without improvising. This is true for the measures you are referring to and for all of the measures affecting the 8 300 European banks. I am therefore happy to continue the dialogue with you and with the rapporteurs you mentioned. My texts are on the table. I tried to draft them as precisely as possible in all areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am nevertheless worried, Ms Ford, about the cumulative effect of all of these texts, particularly when they concern three key investment tools: banks, which finance 75% of the economy of European regions, pension funds and insurance companies. I am therefore watching things very closely – indeed, in a few weeks, we are going to be publishing a comprehensive study on the cumulative impact of all of these measures – and I am very keen to safeguard the investment capacity, especially the long-term investment capacity, of these three sectors: insurance, pension funds and banks. However, with regard to the point that you raise, I am, of course, happy to continue the dialogue with the rapporteurs concerned.</p>

Around a dozen of them have already been approved, including this week in fact, thanks to you, the regulation on short selling, soon to be followed by the regulation on the key derivatives sector. As far as insurance is concerned, we are working on the measures for the technical implementation of Solvency. We are also working on pension funds.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I take a great deal of time, Ms Ford, to listen to everyone. Very recently, I was involved in a major conference on pension funds, which was attended by hundreds of people. We have to take the time to study, to listen, to consult the impact studies. Then, in a few weeks, we will publish the cumulative study on all of this legislation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We can always do more. However, I just want to say that we are paying very close attention to this issue, and I told you myself that I am concerned about the impact of all of these measures on growth. Nonetheless, in general, I think that if we work well together, we are going to establish sound and solid bases for Europe’s financial services, and that will give us a competitive edge.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What has curbed growth for four years is the absence of rules, the absence of transparency, the absence of responsibilities in many companies in the financial sector.

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Andor a question. The free movement of workers is indeed not just an attractive European Union freedom, but also a factor increasing European economic competitiveness. Countries to which skilled workers migrate gain a competitive advantage. However, at the same time, the countries left behind by many skilled workers lose competitiveness. Furthermore, there is increased pressure on the sustainability of pension and social security systems. I would like to ask what steps the European Union should take and how the European Commission proposes to balance the benefits that the free movement of workers can provide for the competitiveness of all Member States? Will the European Commission provide for actions to compensate for the losses experienced by countries enduring mass emigration? I asked the Commissioner this a while ago and perhaps, now that some time has passed, there has been a shift forwards. I would therefore like answers to those questions.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-495-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="László Andor" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">I agree with the implication of your question: that we need not only to promote free movement in Europe, but also to balance the benefits of free movement in the European Union. Our action to promote free movement takes the form of ensuring that the barriers come down. These barriers are of various kinds; while there are still administrative barriers, and issues related to the single market such as the recognition of diplomas, there are also natural barriers linked, for example, to the existence of many different languages, including the 23 official languages. This is also significant, especially if we compare ourselves to the United States.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, difficulties also arise in connection with the great imbalances – and uneven wage levels – between various countries, which drive movements of workers from one country to another. This occurs, especially, where regions – or sometimes even countries – are in recession, with high unemployment rates, and people move to countries where there are jobs available.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is important to ensure that there is freedom of movement and that people who arrive in a country are welcome if they come to work. However, we are also working to achieve a more circular form of free movement whereby, after a certain period in the course of which they gain experience and income, people also return to their home country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also want to ensure that such movement becomes more demand-driven, and that people do not just leave their homeland but have a greater awareness of the concrete vacancies that exist. That is why we developed the Vacancy Monitor as part of the Agenda for new skills and jobs. That is also why the forthcoming new initiative on the EURES programme will help develop EURES – which is a great network for advising people who seek work in another Member State – to be more robust and more demand-driven.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, in order to fully counterbalance the trend of population and labour movements inside Europe, we obviously have to take cohesion policy very seriously and ensure that more peripheral regions do not remain in stagnation or recession, but regain the potential for economic growth.</p>

Indeed, I agree with much of what you said, but, at the same time, I would like to ask for your reaction and that of the other Commissioners to a party’s webpage in the Netherlands, which encourages discrimination against, and hatred of, those workers coming to the Netherlands from Central and Eastern Europe, because, as you have said just now, the free movement of workers makes a direct contribution to both the competitiveness and the gross domestic product of the country in question.

This was followed by the EPSCO Council where Minister Kamp gave his views about this situation to fellow ministers from other European Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think this case is very, very unfortunate. Countries like the Netherlands, where there is a greater level of prosperity – although there are difficulties at this time in terms of growth and budgetary issues – in comparison to the rest of Europe, are in quite a good situation, with a relatively low unemployment rate, and should demonstrate a more welcoming approach and a greater level of cooperation concerning free movement in general and also cooperation on social security coordination.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my question is directed at Mr Andor and Mr Barnier. Do you agree with me that the Charter of Fundamental Rights enshrines the fundamental rights of the citizens and the workers of Europe? I have heard that the Commission is planning a Monti II Regulation which states that the fundamental right to strike can only be exercised if it is in proportion to the freedom to provide services. This means that if a service provider wants to go in for social dumping, it can do so. However, if the trade unions call a strike to oppose this, they must first ask themselves whether this could cause damage to the service provider. As a result, the right to strike will be significantly restricted. The question I have is: can you explain to me what the benefits of a Monti II Regulation of this kind will be? Furthermore, who will benefit from it?</p>

      <p sl="en">This follows in the footsteps of a Monti I Regulation, which did the same in the context of cross-border trade, so in this respect, this forthcoming regulation is not inventing anything particularly new. It actually applies an existing approach to a new issue area, which is cross-border services, like, for example, construction or temporary agency workers coming to agriculture on a temporary basis, because that is the nature of posting.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not about restrictions and this is not about reversing the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. We clarified this a long time ago. This is the way we are developing and finalising the text of this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We are working together to implement an agenda that you are familiar with because several EP committees – particularly the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, but others, too – actively participated in it with rapporteurs. The Single Market Act contains 12 levers for growth, including one on social cohesion and another on services. The 12 key proposals include the text that my colleague and friend, Mr Andor, just mentioned in relation to the posting of workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I just want to say, in general, that that is how we are working on the implementation of this first phase of the Single Market Act and how we are preparing – as President Barroso said this morning – for the second phase, scheduled for autumn, involving 12 new supporting proposals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Each of them – and we had made this commitment to a number of Members of this House and this House itself – is examined from the point of view of its social impact. Each of these measures must, Ms Schroedter, respect the collective and individual rights of workers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, in general, I, personally, together with my colleagues and Mr Andor in particular, have ensured that this agenda is built on the foundations of a competitive social market economy: competitive, social, market, economy. The four words are important; not just one, two or three of them, but all four.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consequently, in the new phase of the Single Market Act, and when implementing the current measures, I will ensure that we safeguard the balance that you can see clearly in the 12 levers for growth that we have identified and on which we are working.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, my question is for Commissioner Andor and Commissioner Barnier. Some Member States, having survived the sudden economic collapse at the outbreak of the global economic crisis, have returned to a path of growth, while others are still unable to cope with the debt problem. Does the Commission analyse the cases of Member States that are emerging from the crisis, so that other countries can take advantage of their experience? What steps is the Commission planning on taking to ensure that austerity measures are combined with measures stimulating growth and employment? Last week, Commissioner Andor participated in a public hearing of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) which I organised, where one of the topics discussed was the role of social investment in emerging from the crisis. How does the Commission assess the role played by social investment in returning to a path of economic growth in Europe?</p>

      <p sl="fr">Ms Jazłowiecka, this is also a very important question. We need to find a good balance in terms of what we are doing in each country, with a great deal of courage on the part of the governments, in order to control public finances, sort out the budgets and reduce the current deficits or debts, which will be the taxes for our children. Along with the collective measures that we are putting in place with your support, with the ‘six-pack’ and soon the new fiscal treaty, we need to ensure that there is good management in Europe and good management in each country, while ensuring that these measures, which are all rigorous, do not curb growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In my opinion, it is time to develop a European growth initiative and to implement together, in a proactive plan, short-term measures, such as those taken or currently being taken to revitalise the interbank sector – and that was the very important role of the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank – the targeted reallocation of the Structural Funds and the project bonds that Mr Kallas mentioned a few moments ago. Those are short-term measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then there are the medium-term measures, for which we need time to adopt the texts. They form the ecosystem that we are creating together with these 50 measures to support the internal market. They include mobility, investment, innovation and risk capital and, Ms Jazłowiecka, among these measures is the sector that you are talking about and one that is very important, in my view. It is not by chance that it is included in the 12 levers. It is social business, which today accounts for between 15% and 18% of Europe’s employment and GDP. It covers all of the social economy businesses, for which we have already submitted to you the statute for a new financial vehicle: social investment funds. More recently, we have had the Statute for a European Foundation. We are going to continue to support this sector, which is very important, in my view. These are, of course, profitable businesses, but they are also businesses that have a particularly ethical dimension, be it in the composition of their staff, for example, disabled people or trainees, or in the markets that they are trying to capture from a social or environmental perspective. I will therefore continue patiently to develop the measures aimed at facilitating the financial and regulatory aspects and the visibility of this sector of social business.</p>

      <p sl="en">I can answer very briefly.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the annual growth survey for 2012 highlighted the importance of addressing the social consequences of the crisis, and many recent initiatives, including, for example, the Youth Opportunities Initiative, underline the importance of the European Social Fund in addressing these issues and intervening where it can.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why a few minutes ago, when the discussion was about Greece, I also underlined the importance of, for example, the ESF in supporting the continued provision of social services so as to prevent the recession from causing even greater damage.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are working with the Member States, especially those most severely affected, to find new solutions. These new solutions very often have to be cost-effective and budget-neutral, because we also have to ensure that fiscal consolidation goes ahead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Consequently the Commission’s services and the exchange of experience between Member States are very helpful for those who have to make progress in terms of social investment and in finding new ways to address social needs.</p>

I would like to ask Mr Kallas whether there has been a follow-up in terms of the compliance of passenger rights for the thousands and thousands of people who were stranded in airports at that time.</p>

I recently said that the Basque Country, which operates under the same legislation as Spain, has half the national unemployment levels due to its economic and productive development, but there has also been a great deal of development in the social economy. Is an improvement in legislation for the social economy across Europe included in your thinking?</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, I would like to know the role of the regions in countering the economic crisis, and the political and social crisis, given that good practices exist, such as those used in the Basque Country, which could be applicable as a model Europe-wide.</p>

We have also dealt with complaints by requiring Member States to implement the rules on passenger rights. Of course, there are always complaints that have not been dealt with satisfactorily, but the system generally works.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now having a discussion about revisiting passenger rights. We have legislation on passenger rights concerning all modes of transport, and we are engaged in consultation processes with stakeholders.

      <p sl="en">I am saying that because, although Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, in the Basque country, it is relatively low. It is half the national average and it is partly because of the very developed nature of the social economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I can start simply by saying that you will have the multiannual financial framework on the table very soon. This will be one element where the European Union can stimulate growth and support various regional and social programmes. So I can only urge you to support the Commission proposal and the ideas in this proposal, which can support economic growth in countries.

      <p sl="fr">Mr Mitchell, if we have to tell people the truth, and it is important to respect them by telling the truth, in many countries where efforts are needed, where the deficits and debts have to be reduced, we have to repair, correct and learn from the mistakes that were made in the past: too much debt, sometimes poor management, often a lack of supervision. We are learning collectively and individually.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have to tell the truth in order to respect the future generations and start again with a more solid foundation. Collectively, we have also taken the right decisions. Now we simply have to do what we said and we will see a more positive spiral beginning to take shape.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Can we provide budgetary stimulus, Mr Mitchell? You, yourself, are not asking for it. There are no more public funds to use as budgetary stimulus, like we did in the past. However, we can create the conditions to increase confidence through this internal market ecosystem. I am using the word that you used and it is crucial. We know that confidence is one of the keys to growth and, if we are talking about money, I think that we need to ensure that the Structural Funds, which are regional solidarity appropriations that your country receives, like many others, Ms Bilbao Barandica, are as effective as possible. Moreover, having managed that policy, I saw how your country used the Structural Funds successfully in the past for training, small and medium-sized enterprises and research.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Then – and we will state it for a third time – we have to be courageous and bold enough to implement the Commission’s proposal on project bonds. We can pool a number of future loans on investments needed for the single market, growth and businesses.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Kallas a question. Indeed, the European Union has adopted rather ambitious plans to link the trans-European networks and your portfolio is a great credit to you and thanks should go to you personally, but we have a major problem with air transport. A few years ago, a directive was adopted which prevented states from supporting air carriers. This happened. We were forced to privatise, we privatised them and many of these privatised air carriers simply went bankrupt. There is a similar situation in the Baltic region, including Lithuania. We have made a significant investment in a varied tourism strategy and will continue to invest in the future. Do you not feel that we should nevertheless conduct a comprehensive European Union study on the development of air transport in the Baltic region, so that if certain circumstances change in future, we would have very clear conclusions on how to develop air transport in this region and Lithuania?</p>

      <p sl="en">I probably cannot answer the last part of the question on studies but, of course, we can always discuss how to develop and examine regional cooperation and some regional projects. This can be a matter of concrete discussion, but with regard to State aid to airlines – State aid is in the hands of our competition authorities. The Commission is always responsible for ensuring that competition is fair. There are certain State aid possibilities for regional airports, for instance, and in order to facilitate and support regional economies, but the Commission can never accept that obsolete companies, which cannot survive, be sustained through the use of taxpayers’ money. This creates unfair competition and others will ask for the same and then everything will come from taxpayers’ money.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is a basic principle concerning concrete cases. Concrete cases are always under very careful examination. It takes a long time but, if the Commission finds that the rules are violated and the situation is not fair, then these kinds of practices must be finished.</p>

In that time, the European Union has expanded from 15 to 27 Member States. If we look at a map of the TEN-T, we can see that it is almost non-existent in the new Member States. Do you intend to review the TEN-T structure with investments in transport in mind in the period ahead?</p>

      <p sl="en">We have proposed a new trans-European network map; this is currently under discussion in the Council. This definitely increases the role of the eastern part of the European Union substantially because we have a TEN-T network which was adopted before the accession of the new Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nobody has so far said that this is not enough in terms of money. Let us first decide this part of the European budget, and let us create mechanisms enabling financial contributions from the private sector, such as project bonds. Contributions from national budgets and the national governments should be made according to the plan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The governments themselves will decide whether everything will be implemented, and whether to allocate a much bigger amount of money for the trans-European network. This can definitely make a substantial contribution to the growth and development of transport.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, the EU can and must play a role in stimulating competitiveness, and the competitiveness of an economy is not based solely on wage costs. We all agree on that. A trained workforce that lives and works in a society that offers social protection and in a state where the private and public sectors invest in research, with highly advanced communication and transport infrastructures, is a workforce that will make the Union more competitive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For months, we have been calling for more sensible management of the crisis focusing primarily on budget cuts and investment to promote growth, employment and social inclusion. However, the texts on economic governance continue to threaten the wage indexation systems that help to maintain domestic consumption and collective agreements.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Unacceptable declarations against the European social model are being made at the highest level. Do you not think that all of these ideas, particularly with regard to some social protection and the budgets of the Member States and the Union, the added value and lever effect of which are undeniable, are, in reality, obstacles to the competitiveness that we so desire?</p>

      <p sl="en">I share your view that a country cannot develop competitiveness in the long run purely by holding wages down. Wages also play an important role in terms of sustaining aggregate demand in the economy, and demand is also very important if we want economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, given how the single market and the single currency have developed in the European Union, we now have to ensure that imbalances do not undermine the stability and the growth potential of the European economy as such. While it is true that the European Commission has no competences as regards wage-related questions, we have to see how, in the broader framework of economic governance, wage-related questions – wage trends, wage-setting mechanisms – can play a role in terms of developing a more stable and more dynamic environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why last year, in the economic semester, some of the country-specific recommendations also pointed to certain wage-setting mechanisms which may have a role in helping – or, if they malfunction, undermining –economic competitiveness, which is why we engaged in dialogue with the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">But this was – and continues to be – a dialogue. The Commission is not imposing certain solutions on the Member States, but we would like to see a constructive approach, and an understanding of the importance of these methods, on the part of the Member States also.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Thank you for your answer, Commissioner. I think that it must be in the framework of a dialogue that we determine what suits certain countries best, depending on what has happened to them in the past, and perhaps see if we can apply that to other countries.</p>

      <p sl="en">(microphone off at start of speech) … your earlier report in the European Parliament did, of course, make a substantial contribution to the debate on minimum income, but I would like to repeat what I said to you some months ago, which is that it would be extremely difficult to envisage legislative proposals on this issue at European level.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, within the Member States – depending, of course, on national traditions and conditions – there is great potential to ensure that there is progress. There are measures, including legislative ones, which can prevent the rise of poverty. Especially in times of crisis, we have to protect the income level of the population, and particularly of the most vulnerable groups, which can include pensioners. That is why – in cooperation with Michel Barnier, who was also part of our efforts to develop sustainable and adequate pensions – we also sought to ensure that, regardless of whether someone is working or retired, there is a guarantee of a decent income level.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are maintaining this holistic approach to governance. As regards wages and wage setting, which was the original focus of your question, we will definitely continue our cooperation with the social partners, who have a fundamental role in this area in the Member States.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, competitiveness and economic growth are obviously not going to be restored with one single measure. We need to take a whole number of measures. And, obviously – as Mr Barnier has already mentioned – a huge number of new regulations are now being unleashed on the financial market. However, small and medium-sized enterprises remain the basic engine of economic growth in Europe and the new financial regulations are, in many cases, also having a negative effect on the granting of credit to those SMEs.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My question is quite specific: what is the Commission going to do to continue to ensure that those SMEs are granted the credit which they need?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second question has to do with the internal market. In that context, it is obviously quite clear that TEN-T and the Connecting Europe Facility could play a significant role in encouraging and strengthening the internal transport market. However, it seems to be very difficult to sell this project to Member States and, moreover, there seems to be a great deal of resistance in the Council to the selection of a number of trans-European projects of a cross-border nature.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr De Backer, with regard to your first point, I am very pleased that, for the first time since the start of this Question Time, someone has mentioned the role of small and medium-sized enterprises. Indeed, 90% of the economic fabric, 90% of the 22 million European businesses, are small and medium-sized enterprises, sometimes even individual enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore want to confirm our position of two years now. Indeed, I announced it at the very start of my term. We want to bring small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers closer to the single market. For too long, they felt that it was not for them, but for the big and the mighty.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr De Backer, you should have a close look at all of the texts that, with our colleague Mr Tajani in particular, we are presenting or publishing, and at what is contained in the Single Market Act, in particular. In each case, you will find that special attention is paid – sometimes for the first time – to the role of SMEs, their capacity for investment, the ease of their administrative procedures and simplification in order to give European SMEs the best ecosystem.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I will give you one example: the bank capitalisation measures, since that is the topic you raised and mention was made earlier of where to obtain funding and cash flow. With Mr Tajani, we asked the European Banking Authority if we could go further – more balanced, less rigorous measures – for the banks when they are obliged to apply prudential measures when lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. We are going to maintain this more favourable criterion for SMEs in the prudential measures.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition to the instrument that we have just presented for risk capital, which is of particular interest to SMEs, we presented a passport, which is currently being debated in Parliament. I am working, notably within the framework of MiFID, on the idea of a European SME grant or a network of European SME grants.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have simplified the reporting obligations for SMEs in terms of their accounts when they are listed on the stock market – I am talking here about listed companies – with the simplified prospectus and more straightforward transparency obligations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We have made it easier for SMEs to access public contracts by reducing drastically the administrative requirements for participating in calls for tender. In the framework of the Small Business Act, for which Mr Tajani is responsible, we have also monitored very closely all of the measures designed to facilitate investment by and thanks to SMEs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Of course, the trans-European network and the TEN-T project are major undertakings. The results are very concrete for every Member State, so the discussions are really very serious. We will be having a Council meeting next week at which we expect the Council to adopt the general approach concerning the TEN-T guidelines, namely, the maps and the network.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are definitely ready to make some compromises, but we will definitely keep the basic principle that this must be a trans-European network. What follows will be more difficult. This is a discussion about connecting Europe which is not in the hands of transport ministers, but mostly in the hands of finance ministers.</p>
      <p sl="en">So there are two parts. I think that the TEN-T maps and TEN-T guidelines will be more or less satisfactory with regard to the trans-European dimension of this project. If they are not satisfactory, the Commission definitely will not accept any watering down of this project.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, it is true that, in the debate on trans-European networks, some Member States are continuing to raise barriers – in particular, to the provision of capital to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="nl">My question is quite specific. In the framework of economic governance, the European Commission has been granted a number of new powers. How can it use those powers to reverse the large number of growth-inhibiting measures which Member States are even continuing to propose today, from time to time, even within the context of budgetary control? How can the Commission see to it that growth-stimulating measures are passed in those various budgets?</p>

      <p sl="fr">As you know, this governance package is being monitored by our colleague, Olli Rehn, who has a very difficult task. You know that we are currently emerging from this difficult crisis and are entering a more positive phase in which we are talking about and working towards growth.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am talking about the recommendations put forward on the structural reform and budget cuts, which the Member States will have to follow. Perhaps they could learn from good examples – and there are some in Europe – and focus their efforts on the sectors and areas that encourage growth. I, personally, believe, and I know that Olli Rehn agrees with me, that everything relating to future investments and investment through small and medium-sized enterprises in education, research and training must be safeguarded or encouraged even if additional efforts are required.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As for the rest, Mr De Backer, we have this whole agenda of supporting measures; some 50 in all that we are putting in place. If you read the Single Market Act carefully, together with the 12 levers for growth and all of the proposals that are before you – at least 20 of them are on the table, with rapporteurs working very hard – you will see very clearly that 80% of them are of interest to SMEs in the ecosystem that we want to create, in which the single market is now an area of opportunities rather than an area of constraints, especially for SMEs. In conclusion, there are many other examples: from the patent to risk capital, from the simplification of accounting standards to the rules on transparency and the prudential measures in the banking sector.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, I have a simple question for the European Commission: In your opinion, does Hungary still have any reason whatsoever to remain a Member State of the European Union? Why am I asking this? I am asking this because in the previous debate, a fellow Member from the Netherlands said that the Dutch had had enough of employees from Eastern Europe, including Hungary. I must say that we, in turn, have had enough of Dutch and other Western European colonisers. Similarly, we have had enough of the process that started when the European Union lured Hungary into joining it under degrading terms and deceptive promises. This process then went on to become all-out colonisation under names such as the free movement of capital, which, of course, was unidirectional, and the free movement of labour, which, on the other hand, went in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It can be called by many names; we call it colonisation. It all continued with Hungary’s being put week after week in the dock, each time for different fabricated charges. This process reached its culmination today when the various finance ministers shamelessly adopted a decision to suspend Cohesion Funds support. Do you believe that after this, you will be able to take over our very own lands as well, when the moratorium expires on 30 April 2014? Tell me, did you ever hear of 1956 and the Hungarian people’s love of freedom?</p>

      <p sl="hu">Ms Morvai, I believe that your words reflect the rather tense relationship that currently exists between the European institutions and Hungary. However, I find it important that we take a level-headed, calm approach to the matter. Vehemence will not lead us to any solutions. At the same time, it is very important to correct the historic overview you gave. After all, the influx of capital to Hungary, for example, began long before the country’s joining the European Union. I suggest that we focus on the present and, in this respect, I find it very important that you understand that the European Commission intends to help Hungary. It intends to help it in regaining investor confidence and more dynamic economic growth, in restoring financial stability and in enabling the government to guide the economy in conformity with European norms and laws.</p>
      <p sl="hu">This presupposes very close, constructive cooperation. The cooperation has begun and, since early January, the government has expressed in a number of ways its intention to reach an agreement on certain disputed issues. The consultations are under way. It is regrettable that, from time to time, the process is infiltrated by noise that carries unnecessary vehemence and sometimes personal attacks. I do hope that we will be able to resolve all issues under dispute in a constructive manner.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through today’s vote, we will officially give the green light to the procedure leading to the adoption of the 2013 budget.</p>
      <p sl="it">When it comes to budgets at times of crisis, the key word is definitely austerity, and I do not think we can ignore that at the moment. However, I think that the EU will never be able to respond properly to the current economic and social crisis or prevent future crises without further political integration, common instruments and measures to strengthen solidarity between the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">There are a number of problems related to the crisis which are troubling the European economies: the reduced competitiveness of our businesses, problems in accessing credit, and the extremely high levels of unemployment, especially among young people. Indeed, I would like to reflect just briefly on young people. The youth of today are more educated, technologically advanced and mobile, and we must support them because they are – and will be – the most important resource for growth in the Union.</p>
      <p sl="it">Unfortunately, however, the statistics to hand are alarming: one young person in five under the age of 25 is looking for work and cannot find it. Moreover, we have 7.5 million young people under the age of 24 who are not in work or education. Accordingly, I think it is essential to use the resources at our disposal to help young people to develop skills that meet the needs of the job market, guaranteeing opportunities for work experience and training in order to ease their path into the world of work.</p>
      <p sl="it">I strongly believe that in order to respond properly to these problems, we need to implement a ready-made and coordinated European initiative, including targeted investments to ensure that we meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs, particularly in terms of youth employment.</p>
      <p sl="it">In this context, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises takes on fundamental significance, as they have the biggest potential for economic growth and innovation, and have provided 85% of new jobs over the last decade. Young people, growth and competitiveness: these are the targets that Parliament has put at the centre of its budget for 2013, both to quell the crisis and to get the European economy moving again, once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="it">The guidelines that we will vote on tomorrow do not go into the specifics of the individual headings and policies. Part of the reason for this is that it would be too early: we are waiting for the Commission to present the draft budget before starting to work on the numbers, when we will be depending on the valuable contribution of each specialised committee for their guidance.</p>
      <p sl="it">We do, however, want to send a message to all Member States, which concerns the major added value that the EU brings. National budgets alone are not enough and no Member State can think about getting through this period by itself. Accordingly, we need to find real synergies between national and European budgets during the European Semester.</p>
      <p sl="it">I must add one final thought on the issue of payments: 2013 is the seventh and final year of the financial perspectives: we all remember what happened during last year’s conciliation procedure and, hence, we have got to expect an increase in payment needs. Therefore, Parliament hereby declares that it will not look favourably on any artificial cuts in budget payments, because this puts us in danger of coming to an unsustainable level of payments in 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">A pure ‘net EU budget contributor/net EU budget beneficiary’ approach does not take due account of the great positive spill-over effects the EU budget produces between Member States to the benefit of common EU policy goals.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome in the name of the Commission the position of Parliament on the guidelines for 2013 and, what is more, I agree with the major points as presented by the rapporteur, Giovanni La Via.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, properly shaping the last budget of the multiannual perspective 2007-2013 is quite a challenge, as is shaping it in the context of overall consolidation of national finances.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nowadays, austerity and consolidation are not the only dimensions of the economic debate in Europe. What is next and what is equally important is how to boost investment, how to boost employment opportunities, especially for the younger generation, and how to support small and medium-sized companies in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here is the place and here is the added value of the European budget and here is the perspective we should also seek for the European budget in the discussions over 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to properly shape the budget for 2013, we should take into account the logic of the multiannual perspective. It is a very well known logic.</p>
      <p sl="en">Everything is moving late, but moving at cruising speed at the end of the financial perspective, and we should remember, as mentioned by the rapporteur, the lesson of 2011. Another important lesson is the full implementation of commitments and payments, but also more than 100% consumption and implementation in many areas, for example, competitiveness and innovation – 135% implementation; lifelong learning – 107%; Social Fund – 111% of what was assumed for 2011. There is also the lesson of reimbursements. Bills for reimbursement came late in December. The inability of the Commission to pay what it should pay for legitimate projects in several countries is also affected by the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are not able, due to the shortage of money, to repay Rome over EUR 2 billion, to repay Madrid more than EUR 2 billion and to repay more than EUR 1 billion to Athens. This is an important lesson for drawing up our draft budget for 2013 and, I think, for the conciliation procedure of 2013. There is also inflexibility over financial regulation; that is, the inability to transfer what is underspent to what should be spent at the end of the year. These are the reasons for the cash-flow problem today and it cannot be repeated next year with the accumulation of all sorts of problems.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, in 2013, we should be equally sensitive to negative priorities, that is, what is under-implemented, but also how to boost the growth opportunities and investment opportunities for the younger generation via existing means at our disposal. Additionally, we have to find a place for ITER financing and we also have to accommodate Croatia joining as Member State Number 28 as from July 2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, concerning the area of savings and to prove that we are really taking into account all sorts of things in the environment of today’s Europe, we must consider administration. That is why we should not grow in administration. In the Commission, we are starting the programme of annual cuts, not waiting for the next financial perspective but starting for 2013 – 1% cuts in the administration of the Commission every year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us hope that this time, we are drawing on the lessons of experience and I count very much upon the wisdom of the people elected by the people, here in Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I shall restrict myself to one point with this reduced speaking time.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to thank and congratulate Commissioner Lewandowski and say that after two years of budgetary austerity, the situation of the European budget is becoming untenable. For the Member States which finance most of the budget, the level of payment appropriations is no longer sustainable. Some Member States are themselves ruined; they can no longer increase their contribution to the European budget. The others are busy paying the previous budgets; so they, too, are unable to increase their contribution, which is calculated on the basis of the payment appropriations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, however, as regards EU programmes in these latter years of the current multiannual financial framework, the level of payment appropriations is so low that, in reality, the Union is practically in default. This is not a default that affects lenders but local authorities, companies, researchers, innovators, all those who are carrying forward investment projects, on which a return to growth depends.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, before any negotiation on the next budget, we have a duty to closely examine the precise state of the requirements and the consumption of the payment appropriations. The more difficult the political agreement, the greater the need for us to guarantee that we are all actually talking about the same figures. We must be realistic, but a budget based on the principle of reality must start out from the same figures. I hope that, from there, we shall be able to arrive at the optimal solution both for the Council and for Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, there are increasing numbers of people in Europe who have identified that as the problem, but the real problem is this Europe of austerity, sanctions and obligations that many of us here today disagree with. I say this because when debating political guidelines, it is more important to agree our strategy than go into details about how we are going to fund the policies, which is where I believe we are failing here.</p>
      <p sl="es">I really hope the proposed budget for 2013 is in line with what you have expressed today because we will be on the right track in that case. Up to now, however, you have prioritised temporary and short-term debates over a structured and long-term approach. You have paid more attention to resolving the consequences of the crisis rather than the causes, and you have imposed austerity as the only way out of the crisis. As you mentioned, history shows us that austerity has never worked. For this reason, in this report, we call on you to use the budget to put measures in place that promote solidarity and stimulate sustainable economic growth.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is clear that the European budget is too small to get us out of this crisis, but it can and should play a decisive role when it comes to deciding our priorities when using this EUR 150 billion. On 30 January, the members of the European Council issued a statement in which they stressed the need for investment in growth and job creation, particularly for SMEs and young people. The Commission made a major announcement that we were going to invest EUR 82 billion, but we have not really heard much about this great announcement since. It has gone from being a headline to complete silence.</p>
      <p sl="es">You have to work on the European Union budget to develop the policies for the Europe 2020 strategy, which we always forget about, with the goal of promoting competitiveness and innovation. You have to present a budget that supports SMEs, so that they do not have to reduce their investments due to the crisis. You have to adopt a sustainable industrial policy. You have to urgently tackle unemployment and the rising poverty levels within the European Union. All of this can only be realised through a serious and responsible budget, coordinated with national budgets, with the aim of fulfilling the Union’s priorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, if you continue to view the budget as a table of figures where cuts can be made, you will be going about things the wrong way. If you believe that cutbacks in innovation and research are the way to finance ITER, then you are again in the wrong. By continually focusing your approach on cutbacks or delays in payments, you are not only going about things the wrong way, but also infringing on the legislation that you yourselves have approved.</p>
      <p sl="es">Commissioner Lewandowski, we know that these are difficult times, but we also know that things can be done differently and in a better way, which you mentioned here today and I hope you keep your word. Therefore, we should work together to make our resources work and meet our objectives.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, thank you, Mr Lewandowski, for the proposal you have submitted. It is not easy to present a budget when so many different interests are involved and Mr La Via has succeeded in highlighting the majority of Parliament’s priorities. In my opinion, there are three decisive aspects to the budget guidelines: the budget must be balanced, it must be sensible and it must be responsible. Mr Lamassoure has just referred to the fact that we have had two austerity budgets in a row. This is absolutely the right thing to do in this situation. During this period, the Member States have only been able to provide limited resources. At the same time, as the previous speaker rightly pointed out, we need to make investments. These are, of course, complementary measures. First of all, we need to create the necessary structures, which are based on a responsible approach to the use of taxpayers’ money, so that we can make investments. Otherwise, we will be throwing good money after bad and this cannot be in our interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, I believe it is important that we remind ourselves of this in the guidelines from the parliamentary side. We played a significant role in ensuring that the Member States agreed on automatic sanctions after the summit on 1 and 2 March and this must now be put into practice. I would like to see the Commission and not the Council taking responsibility for this, because then we could be sure that it would be implemented. At the same time, however, we need to give the Member States support with regard to European added value. The issue of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been mentioned. They form the backbone of the European economy. It is not the large organisations and the multinationals that create jobs. It is the medium-sized companies which ensure that Europe’s engine for growth and employment continues to function.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, we need to make targeted and sensible use of money. More funding does not necessarily mean better policies. Finally, I would like to express my full support for what Mr Lamassoure said about the need to resolve the problem of the outstanding commitments or reste à liquider . Most importantly, as far as the budget is concerned – and it is a pity that the Member States are not represented – it would make sense for us to draw up a sensible budget right from the start, so that we do not find ourselves in a difficult situation because amending budgets are required.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, all 27 Member States of the European Union are faced with a number of tasks. They must put in place a debt brake, they must make progress with the necessary structural reforms and they must invest in new competitiveness.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Lewandowski has just rightly said that consolidation is the one important task, which, although it is not enjoyable, is absolutely necessary, but that is not enough. The question is how we are to make particularly clever investments over the next few years. It goes without saying that the European budget does not include any debts. It also only amounts to 1% of the gross domestic product of the Member States, but nevertheless, it is clear that the European budget has an essential role to play with regard to the way in which the European Union will invest in future developments over the next few years.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Parliament and the Council have agreed on a modernisation strategy, which is the Europe 2020 strategy. This is primarily about investing in inclusive growth and in sustainability, which means renewable energies, new energy grids and research in this area that will genuinely improve our position on both the European internal market and the world market.</p>
      <p sl="de">Only when we have new sustainable products will we be able to create new jobs. New studies indicate once again that if we invest in sustainable agricultural policy and in sustainability using the Structural Funds, we will create more new jobs than was possible with the old measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sadly, we have just had the first anniversary of Fukushima. You have said that we must do everything possible to continue funding the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. I think this is the wrong decision, because this technology also generates nuclear waste. We would be well advised to invest our resources, which we really must concentrate in specific areas, in no-risk technologies and new sustainable technologies and products. This would allow Europe to make faster progress.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this budget comes at a time when it is important to take into account the economic and budgetary constraints at national level. That means that it is going to be important to strike the right balance between austerity and sound, judicious investment.</p>
      <p sl="en">In that respect, our rapporteur has set out a number of principles which we are happy to support. I strongly agree with his assertion that we need a budget that focuses on jobs and growth. He is right to point out that this is best achieved through clear prioritisation and targeted, coordinated investment amongst the Member States. In particular, I strongly agree with him that the key test for EU expenditure must be the creation of European added value.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would also impress on him, however, the need for value for money. I would urge greater thought to be given to the efficiency of this budgetary process. Specifically, inaccurate budgeting and the growth in the ‘Reste à Liquider’ both lead to large sums of unspent money, both of which suggest that we should be looking for ways to increase flexibility in the budgeting process.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the one point that is missing in this report is a commentary on the size of the budget. At a time when most of Europe is experiencing austerity and most of Europe’s governments are cutting expenditure, it is most important that we, too, show a determination to reduce our expenditure wherever possible. Can I therefore recommend to our rapporteur that in his future report, he calls for a freeze in the size of the budget?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to start with the positive aspects. I would like to emphasise that we welcome what Mr La Via’s report says on the subject of growth, which is that the focus must be on growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">We need growth that creates jobs and that can help combat youth unemployment. We think that this is very important. I would like to highlight the fact that we welcome the points relating to research and investment in research. However, I think we need clearer statements on fighting poverty within Europe and also in the world as a whole, on a global level. Moreover, the report did not look at how we are to combat climate change.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very critical of the opening section of the report, which concerns automatic sanctions. I think that threatening the Member States with automatic sanctions is a mistake, given that they are already in a difficult situation with regard to their budgets. We are opposed to this.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I want to highlight one point which I think is very sensible and that is increased coordination of the budgets of the Member States and the EU using a process which has democratic legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one final remark on the subject of cutbacks. I want to emphasise that we do not believe that budget cuts are appropriate. We have already made it clear that Croatia will be joining the EU during the course of the year. We will have a whole series of new jobs to do in the EU and we have had new supervisory bodies in place now for more than a year. We need these bodies and we need funding and staff for them, so that they can work effectively and prevent future crises. This will ensure that the expenditure is a sensible investment which will help us to save money in future. In my opinion, these are the crucial points. Most importantly, we hope that we can work to ensure that there are no budget cuts. For us, that is essential.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we already know that billions in taxpayers’ money was wasted in financing the failed Lisbon Agenda, but the EU institutions will never admit their responsibility for helping to create this crisis. Instead, they are asking for more money from EU citizens to finance another failure to come: the 2020 Agenda. This is treating EU citizens as fools. When will this Parliament realise that stimulating growth and jobs requires much less red tape and much less pointless legislation? Why can this Parliament not admit that growth-targeted spending would be best directed at Member State level?</p>
      <p sl="en">Year after year, this Parliament is happy to put more taxpayers’ money in the hands of the Commission, an institution which – as the auditors tell us – is unable to ensure the proper use of EU funding. Of course, the Commission never runs a deficit, and it never will, because it can always go back to the Member States and tax them more to balance its books.</p>
      <p sl="en">If this House refuses to show common sense and responsibility, it will be the architect of its own downfall. I, for one, am calling on the British Government to reduce its contribution to the 2013 EU budget by 10% in comparison with this year’s contribution. However, when it comes to the UK coalition government, I will not be holding my breath.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the EU budget is one of the most important visible representations of the solidarity between the Member States and between the generations, particularly at this time of crisis. I very much welcome the fact that the guidelines highlight the particular importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU. Between 2002 and 2010, they created around 85% of all the new jobs in the EU. They are the backbone of future economic growth and, therefore, they need more support than they have been given in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report focuses on the serious problem of high levels of youth unemployment in Europe. In this area, we must take the necessary measures quickly and decisively. The results of the Europe 2020 strategy depend, to a large extent, on the young people of today. They are well trained, they are up to date with the latest technology and they are mobile, which is why they represent the most important capital for growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Budget resources must be diverted from all the Structural Funds, so that we can provide EUR 28 billion to support SMEs and to combat youth unemployment. This is the first step in the right direction.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to say that I very much regret the fact that the Danish Presidency is not present here. I do not know the reason for this absence. I hope that the Danish Presidency, using modern methods and technologies, will listen to us on the Internet or otherwise. I am sure that many of the arguments made here will be repeated in the negotiations that await us this year.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, Europe needs growth-enhancing investments. In times of crisis, we need to strengthen the competitiveness and innovativeness of the European economies, but we also need – and this is very important – to support small and medium-sized enterprises, because they create new jobs. I would also like to repeat something we often discuss in connection with other programmes and other EU policies, namely, the importance of supporting young Europeans in finding their first job. Young Europeans are increasingly well-educated but, at the same time, they face ever greater problems finding a niche in the labour market and finding employment.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am convinced that the catalyst for investment in jobs and growth is the European Union’s budget. It is therefore very important that we adopt an appropriate budget for 2013, a budget that allows for the implementation of agreed and key EU policies and commitments. I would also like to emphasise that 2013 is the last year of the multiannual financial framework. We must therefore have an appropriate level of payments to meet our commitments.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, we should stick to tried and tested principles when considering the 2013 EU budget today. It is, above all, necessary to take a realistic view of the situation. The report’s claim that deepening integration and EU budget growth can avert the economic crisis and prevent other crises is wide of the mark. We must not take advantage of the current crisis to increase budget expenditure. We need, on the contrary, a stable budget at about the current level of expenditure, which will be adopted quickly and without the unnecessary arguments and interinstitutional clashes we have seen in the last two years. The 2013 budget must take account of current developments in the EU, including the accession of Croatia, and also the fact that for the first time since 2004, farmers in the new Member States will receive the same direct payments as their previously better funded West European colleagues. We must also take account of the fact that we are still in a situation of economic stagnation – and in some places even crisis – where national budgets are forced to make cuts and limit expenditure. We should do likewise.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I completely agree with Mr La Via as regards the concerns over the advantages to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially when it comes to the huge problems they currently face in obtaining EU funding.</p>
      <p sl="it">That said, there is one important thing that needs to be flagged up, on which I have tabled an amendment that will be put to the vote tomorrow: European funds should only go to those businesses that invest in their local area to boost its competitiveness. Under no circumstances can we fund enterprises that transfer their business elsewhere by relocating to cheaper countries. The existing rules on this should be toughened up and anyone who breaks them should pay back the funds.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is not much money available: SMEs cannot even manage to get hold of loans provided to Europe’s banks by the European Central Bank precisely to support them. What little we have should therefore be used as well as possible and absolutely must not end up in the hands of those who take advantage, often at the expense of workers.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, today we are debating the report on the 2013 budget by Giovanni La Via, a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). It is about solidarity and about handing over even more power to Brussels. Here is a quote from the report: ‘Parliament takes the view that solidarity and austerity measures undertaken at national level should not lead to an equivalent decrease at EU level’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Yes, you heard that right! While citizens in the Member States are doing their utmost to save money, Brussels says: just carry on partying, because we will not be making any cuts. We, the Euro elite, will never give up a single cent. You know that it is our children, more than anyone else, who will be the victims of this terrible policy of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats and the PPE Group. The day will come, Mr President, when the Netherlands, as a Member State, will not only reject the previous year’s budget, but also that for the new, coming year. The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is going to do exactly that right now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I will finish with a warning from Woodrow Wilson:</p>
      <p sl="nl">‘When government does not know what it is supposed to do, it ends up with trying to do everything. Liberty has never come from governments. The history of liberty is a history of limitations of government power, not the increase of it’.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, efforts to stabilise national budgets are necessary, but they undermine immediate growth. Beyond the measures for a return to balanced budgets, a number of necessary structural reforms, such as Basel II, Solvency and so on, have further weakened the natural economic dynamic. Without investment, without growth, the recession cancels out the debt reduction policies, increases deficits, makes competitiveness and purchasing power collapse and, all told, we get the opposite of the desired result.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Investment in three priority areas is necessary to re-launch our economies: innovation, education and infrastructure. It is precisely at European level that these areas are most effective. Applying a pure logic of austerity at European level is to believe that each State individually will recover better due to restraint. The structure of the European budget, its use and its objectives are different from those of national budgets. Even though it is modest, this budget is still the best integrated anti-crisis tool and, as such, it must be energised, not restricted.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the 2013 budget must be a budget for economic growth, employment and cohesion. To this end, I am hoping for a positive and realistic attitude from the Council, so that it might make available sufficient funds for payment appropriations. The present multiannual financial framework is in cruise control and entering its final stages. It would be unacceptable if there were insufficient cohesion policy funding for the various Member States’ projects.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Union budget is of undeniable benefit and, for this very reason, it should be increased, particularly in times of crisis. In this context, it is crucial to support the implementation of specific measures, redoubling budgetary efforts to support competitiveness, innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), since therein lies the majority of the European Union’s economic potential.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In conclusion, Mr President, I advocate the implementation of measures for promoting youth employment and I would make a suggestion in that regard: funds left over from administrative expenditure – that is, heading 5 – should be spent on SMEs and young people.</p>

The funds to meet commitments should therefore increase this year. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult. It is worth noting that the level of overdue commitments in the EU is increasing. At the end of 2011, the figure amounted to EUR 207 billion, and in 2013, at least EUR 152 billion will be needed. We are well aware that the EU does not have this kind of income in any year.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is vitally important that the EU budget is focused on addressing the economic and financial crisis. With EU countries sliding back into recession, it is vital that EU funds are efficiently targeted at jobs, growth and investment to try and turn the EU economies around. Austerity alone cannot rescue us from the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 2013 budget year will prove to be a very difficult one with, on the one hand, a real need for budgetary constraint and austerity but, on the other hand, significant demands for payments from Member States as we come to the end of this financial perspective. As the Commissioner pointed out, with at least EUR 5 billion of payments which were carried over from the last financial year, it is absolutely vital that the Commission get a clear idea of the likely drawdown for 2013 from Member States. There can be no surprises or else it is going to be very difficult to try and shape a sensible budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to see us aim for a freeze in real terms of the 2013 budget but this must be tempered by the fact that we are nearing the end of the financial perspective and the budget must reflect that fact.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the tough economic and financial climate created by the crisis has tested the Member States’ already wobbly budgets to the limit. This has caused a major fall in public investment in key sectors for reviving employment and economic growth. The guidelines set out for the 2013 budget focus on creating jobs for young people, in particular, by supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises that make up 90% of the EU’s production base.</p>
      <p sl="it">A suitable level of funding for the EU’s 2013 budget is crucial, since it is the final year of the current financial programming and this funding will form a model for what is to follow. It ought, also, to set out a pathway to growth, jobs and competitiveness in view of the Europe 2020 strategy.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, despite all the warnings about the shortage of credit, the EU has, as we know, focused on the various Basel directives, although the Anglo-American countries, which is where these calls are coming from, were careless about implementing Basel I. However, a one-off subsidy in the form of EUR 28 billion for small and medium-sized businesses is, in my opinion, not enough to compensate for the mistakes of recent decades.</p>
      <p sl="de">Firstly, the Basel directives need to be revised and we must give small and medium-sized businesses permanent access to EU subsidies.

The clear way in which the objectives to be pursued have been set out, along with the budgetary implications of these objectives, also sends out strong signals regarding the form the budget will have to take in the coming years. The European Union has large ambitions and needs a budget to match.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, however, I disagree with the wording of Article 9.

The illness in this case is the current economic crisis, but it could just as easily have been domestic violence, international tension or painful haemorrhoids in the elderly. The remedy would still be further political and economic integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">If you think that comparing the EU with travelling salesmen is unfair, listen to this: ‘Parliament … takes the view that austerity measures undertaken at national level should not lead to an equivalent decrease at EU level’. And this is the best bit: ‘since one euro spent at this level can generate savings in the 27 Member States’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I once bought a second-hand car from somebody who asked me on what I was going to spend the money that he had saved me. To parody the words of Norman Tebbit about the EU: ‘if it talks like a spiv and acts like a spiv, perhaps it is a spiv’.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am in agreement with the absolute majority of your comments. Just a short response to Ms Andreasen – Mr Hartong may stick to the habit of leaving the room before the answer comes – and also to Mr Brons.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even in austerity, you have to pay your bills, the electricity bills and the other bills, and the responsibility and credibility of the European budget lie precisely here. Our inability to repay, to reimburse to Athens, to Rome, to Madrid, to Lisbon, the countries under financial stress, money for what was accomplished, what was legitimate, is clearly inconsistent with the political declarations that we should supply; we should do our utmost within our means to help these countries to get out of the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that this simple truth could be our guide in the forthcoming procedure for 2013, but even with the best will in the world, we are not able, given the pressure upon the budget, to repay all the outstanding commitments, and this is my short answer to Mr Zemke.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having given the rapporteur the final word in the debate as usual and I would like to apologise to the Commissioner who came and had already left to take the place of Mr Lewandowski. Allow me to finish up by saying thank you to the Commissioner, obviously, and to all my fellow Members for their contributions to the discussion.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, I would just like to emphasise a couple of points. The first, which came out in various speeches, is the payment requirement. We are at the end of the multiannual financial framework and there are bills to be paid, there are commitments made in previous years that have generated – and still generate – payments that have to be made. These payments must be honoured. On this point, I would obviously like to ask the Commission to be unabashed in the 25 April budget proposal, bearing in mind the bills to pay and the payments to be made, setting out fairly what has to be done.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to thank everyone for their support for the strategy on small and medium-sized enterprises, which – I am absolutely sure – is a key driver for job creation and economic recovery, so I obviously hope that the budget will reflect this. I did not look into the priorities of the individual budget lines because I believe that is what procedure dictates. Evidently, we will have time to identify Parliament’s priorities, both positive and negative. However, I would like to appeal to the other institutions – the Council is not here right now, but we all hope it is following our work and our debate – for robust interinstitutional cooperation so that we can see this process through together and come up with an EU budget that is sizeable enough to face the challenges ahead, especially at a difficult time of economic crisis like the present.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is a sensitive time to be discussing budgetary issues in current economic conditions. The guidelines for 2013 put forward by Mr La Via echo our previous calls for the Council to balance austerity with investment. We have repeatedly stated that economic recovery cannot be achieved by austerity alone. Promoting growth and job creation requires specific actions and enhanced budgetary efforts to support European competitiveness, innovation and SMEs. Entrepreneurship is another theme we should support, especially female entrepreneurs. International Women's Day reminded us of the great financial contribution women employers and business owners make to the economy. Supporting female entrepreneurs fits the EU 2020 strategy. Another important issue is payments. I strongly urge EU Member States to reduce the level of payments for 2013. The level of payments should take account of actual budgetary needs and existing agreements with other countries and institutions. If payment levels are reduced, the EU’s ability to respect standing agreements and obligations will also be reduced. The 2013 guidelines should be seen as a tool to boost growth and ensure Europe is prepared to address future financial difficulties. We need to guarantee a responsible budget that will strike the right balance between our needs, our responsibilities and our commitments.</p>

      <p sl="fr">By defining the general guidelines for the preparation of the 2013 budget, Parliament wanted to focus mainly on support for jobs (especially for young people) and SMEs. These priorities bear a strange resemblance to the priorities Parliament defined for the 2012 budget. Now, the difficulties of the latest budget negotiations are already putting in doubt the result of the discussions that are soon to take place on the drafting of the 2013 budget. Are the budget guidelines merely Parliament’s pious hopes? I fear so, as the negotiations have followed the same tragic route for two years: the draft budget from the Commission, supported by Parliament, undergoes cuts by the Council, which is more interested in reducing its contribution to the EU budget than in the budget’s added-value. This fool’s game has been played since Parliament failed to use its new powers of budgetary codecision to oppose the Council’s sterile wishes in 2010. 2012 will also be the year when the 2014-2020 financial framework is drafted. It will be difficult to prevent the Council’s short-term ‘in times of crisis’ vision from being applied to the definition of the ‘post-crisis’ financial perspectives. We must, however, support an ambitious position, for a Europe in line with the expectations of Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Appropriate allocation of the 2013 budget is particularly important to both the Member States and the EU as a whole because the impact of the crisis can be felt continuously, and effective, concrete action is becoming increasingly urgent. One of the most important issues concerns SMEs. Generating the vast majority of new jobs, this sector is the engine driving our economy. The Europe 2020 strategy sets economic growth, job creation and the generation and maintenance of competitiveness as some of the EU’s key objectives. I am of the belief that we must allocate considerable resources to small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensure a suitable environment to assist start-ups. The recovery and invigoration of the SMEs sector would generate increased labour market demand. In this context, emphasis must be given to another relevant subject, namely that of young people, who represent the future of the EU. Resources spent on education, research and development and innovation also represent indirect support to SMEs. We need only think of how many enterprising youths there could be, and how few young people actually take the risk of starting their own business. Instead, they put their creative and innovative ideas to use at various multinational companies, which is a barrier to the EU’s competitiveness. There are numerous alternative solutions to help invigorate the sector, such as investments in business incubators, whether they are start-up centres that help and monitor the establishment of businesses, or technology centres that are clusters of sites suitable for innovative, technologically oriented enterprises. For all this to be implemented, we need new budgetary resources, a possible source of which could be Eurobonds or the introduction of a financial transaction tax.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The EU will only be able to respond adequately to the current economic and social crisis, or prevent future crises, if the integration of common instruments such as automatic sanctions and the Commission having the right to take legal action in a deficit procedure is realised in political terms. Without joint programmes financed from EU funds and funds for their operation, this will not happen.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Many countries have shifted a large financial burden to future generations, and for many years, their public spending far exceeded their income. Financial markets will not be willing to refinance public debts if governments do not consolidate and resolve the discrepancy between public revenue and expenditure.</p>
      <p sl="sk">They will monitor consolidation and the strengthened fiscal framework at European level closely. The EU budget is one of the most important instruments for expressing solidarity between Member States. If the EU’s policies were to be financed solely by Member States, their costs would skyrocket. The European budget is a clear common saving.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The austerity measures adopted at national level should not lead to an equivalent reduction of funds at EU level. Every euro paid out at this level may generate savings in the Member States. The annual budget of the European Union with its leverage effect, priorities set out in national budgets, and all other European policy instruments, must support the policies for the recovery of the Member States, and must be in accordance with the growth and jobs strategy, Europe 2020.</p>

      <p sl="el">Decisive steps need to be taken in 2013 in order to end the crisis and start economic recovery. The EU budget is in a position to strengthen solidarity, kick start growth and support increased employment. The slogan for the decisions to be taken on the EU budget for next year should be ‘growth and employment’, rather than ‘austerity’. It should also be made clear to the Council that it cannot continue to ignore real needs and outstanding payments if we are to avoid a repeat of what happened last December, when the Council refused to finance claims of EUR 10 billion. As a result of that, the payments in question were postponed to 2012 and are expected to cause numerous problems towards the year end. Finally, I should like to point out that the accession of Croatia to the EU should be accompanied by suitable additional financing and to emphasise that I am totally opposed to any form of rearrangement of the top priorities of the European Parliament in terms of financing for ITER.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The European Union’s 2013 budget represents the closure of the current seven-year financial framework. It is this year that Member State cohesion programmes will be at full swing, and it is now that the largest sums will need to be disbursed. At the same time, the 2013 EU budget will also reflect the individual institutions’ ideas regarding the future as, in the absence of a consensus, this year will serve as the basis for the next period. The European Parliament sees the European budget as a means of recovery from the crisis and an engine of growth and job creation: a reflection of the intention to create a strong Europe guided by common policies and possessing sufficient funds. Some Member States are interested in a smaller EU budget and, focusing on short-term goals, would rather reduce their contributions. This carries an enormous risk, as it diminishes faith in European solidarity and in the EU, and leads citizens to turn away from the EU institutions. In the long term, this could jeopardise the very existence of the EU. In the medium term, the success of the Europe 2020 programme could also become questionable if we fail to provide sufficient financial resources for its implementation. We must not tarry, but show citizens that they live in a European Union which uses its funds in a sensible and appropriate manner to achieve common goals and strengthen the European idea.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, it falls to me to launch a debate on two issues that are linked but different. The first is the International Cocoa Agreement 2010, for which Parliament’s assent is being requested, and the second is a motion for a resolution on child labour in the cocoa sector. I am the rapporteur for the Committee on International Trade and the author of the resolution that the same committee is tabling before Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards the former, the Committee on International Trade is unanimously proposing that Parliament authorise the Council to conclude the International Cocoa Agreement 2010 for three key reasons. Firstly, the agreement makes the International Cocoa Organisation (ICO) better able to take action in this sector. Secondly, the agreement confers greater clarity and transparency as regards how the ICO operates, and increases civil society participation in its work. Thirdly, the aforementioned agreement introduces new provisions intended to promote sound labour relations and a sustainable cocoa economy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The agreement requires the contracting parties to improve working conditions, in line with the internationally recognised rules and principles of the International Labour Organisation. It also encourages the contracting parties themselves to promote the sustainable development of the cocoa economy and to implement programmes and projects with a view to achieving these goals. As one of the major cocoa importers, the European Union has an increased responsibility to guarantee that production of, and trade in, cocoa are undertaken in the most transparent and sustainable way possible. The International Cocoa Agreement, which is, in fact, provisionally in force, is currently our best ally in taking up this responsibility.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards the resolution that I mentioned, I believe the issue of child labour on cocoa plantations is too serious for us to ignore it when giving our consent to the International Cocoa Agreement. That is why I tabled, and the Committee on International Trade adopted, the motion for a resolution expressing our concerns about the continued use of child labour on cocoa plantations, particularly in western Africa.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the last 10 years, increasing awareness of this issue amongst consumers and producers, as well as amongst political decision makers, has been leading to the welcome mobilisation of the international cocoa industry to work together with all stakeholders, such as international institutions, trades unions and NGOs, to eliminate, at least, the worst forms of child labour in cocoa production. Nonetheless, much remains to be done. Children working in cocoa fields are exposed to serious health risks. There are no reliable data on the scale of the problem. The estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Whatever its extent, it is enough for us to be concerned, and for us to stretch ourselves to breaking point to eradicate child labour in cocoa production, and its most serious forms in particular.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The issue of child labour should be dealt with comprehensively, involving political decision makers, stakeholders and, obviously, the EU institutions. I await the comments of the Commission, to which we would pose specific questions: we would like concrete and satisfactory answers on how it believes the EU should respond to this issue.</p>

    <intervention id="2-585-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Andris Piebalgs" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Moreira and the Committee on International Trade for their proposal that this House consent to the conclusion of the International Cocoa Agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission agrees with Parliament’s view that the new agreement is a good platform to promote international cooperation in the world cocoa sector and that it will contribute to the strengthening of the national cocoa economies. This agreement will enable the world markets to strive towards obtaining fair prices for both producers and consumers, while also leading to equitable economic returns and promoting a sustainable cocoa economy. All these elements are of paramount importance for cocoa producer countries, which also, in most cases, happen to be developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Being the world’s main importer and consumer of cocoa, the European Union has a clear role and a responsibility to promote the increased sustainability of a fair cocoa trade in these countries. With this responsibility in mind, we recognise that the question of child labour represents one of the most difficult challenges – the controversial aspect being that, in our view, the idea is abhorrent, while in some other traditions, it is an accepted practice.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we agree with the ILO, ICCO and the World Cocoa Foundation that the agreement is a good starting point to address the issue of child labour in this particular sector. We could even go further on this issue by saying that the problem of child labour goes well beyond the cocoa sector and, unfortunately, affects nearly all our developing partners.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the rights of the child are enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is a priority for us to protect and promote these rights, and the Commission is deeply committed to this cause. The EU remains engaged in eradicating the worst forms of child labour at global level and in ensuring that a child’s education is not sacrificed to the need to work and that children’s physical and emotional development is not adversely affected. At international level, under Article 32 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, children have the right to be protected from economic exploitation and from child labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">Nevertheless, the Commission has repeatedly expressed its profound regret that, despite the efforts of the international community – including the near universal ratification of ILO Convention 182, which requires the complete eradication of this practice – an ever increasing number of children are engaged in activities that meet the ILO definition of child labour. I would like to point out that today, a shocking 124 million children are engaged in the worst forms of child labour and that the overall trend in sub-Saharan Africa is up by nearly 30%. This should give us all food for thought. I therefore really appreciate and welcome the interest that Mr Moreira and a large number of Members of this House attach to this issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">But the issue is complex. In developing countries, and in particular in the cocoa sector, the problem of child labour cannot be considered in isolation. An integrated approach must tackle other very relevant issues stemming from the root causes of poverty and the subsequent need for child labour and trafficking of children for this labour.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the draft recommendation rightly acknowledges, 90% of cocoa farmers in West Africa are smallholders. These are family farms facing huge challenges. They are sometimes located 40 km down a dirt track and have extremely difficult access to infrastructure. In these circumstances, children will, of course, be working on the farm. In order to assist communities to provide the conditions where children will no longer need to be employed, the Commission is fully engaged through its development cooperation and its policies that we apply in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU’s engagement is outlined in the 2010 Commission staff working paper on child labour and the June 2010 Council conclusions. Policy coherence and coordination are essential components to this effort and, with this in mind, we have in place a coordinated EU approach, working with the relevant international organisations and bodies. This is coupled with helping West African countries to address the issues themselves, including through cooperation on improved infrastructure and farming methods and providing for more and better labour inspection and market organisation.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, I would like to reaffirm my strong belief that a child’s place is at school and not in the fields or factories. Eradicating poverty is the first objective that we should try to achieve: tackling the root cause of child labour in Africa and in all developing countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am therefore very grateful to the European Parliament, which has once again put this very important issue high on its agenda. The Commission, as usual, will address the issue in its work.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members from the other groups for their cooperation. I think that this report and, most importantly, the accompanying resolution represent a very good compromise. It goes without saying that the new version of the International Cocoa Agreement is an important, long-term step in the positive collaboration between cocoa-producing and cocoa-consuming countries. Giving cocoa farmers and their families the security to plan ahead, creating food security, introducing general cooperation on development and combating exploitative child labour all make an important contribution to sustainable growth in the cocoa sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are responsible for ensuring that producers can continue to develop their businesses in future under fair conditions. The fight against exploitative child labour, which I have just mentioned, is the subject of the resolution by the Committee on International Trade. As I have already said, we have been able to agree across all the groups on some basic points, including, most importantly, the definition of child labour, because not all child labour is equally exploitative and dangerous.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is reflected in the situation in the largest cocoa-producing countries. Cocoa is cultivated and harvested almost exclusively on family farms where the children help their parents. Important factors here are access to education and the general development of the children. We must focus our attention on exploitative child labour which harms children’s health and we must use all the resources at our disposal to combat it. I believe that this resolution highlights the concerns of the European Parliament in a targeted and, above all, balanced way. In my opinion, there is no need for any changes to the resolution and I will be pleased if the rapporteur can ensure that the positive and fruitful cooperation which we saw in the committee continues in plenary.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mr Moreira on his excellent work, on both the resolution and the agreement.</p>
      <p sl="es">This new International Cocoa Agreement, which we will vote on tomorrow, undoubtedly contains very timely measures that are an improvement on the previous one. There are measures to aid the development of the economies of the producing countries, for fair prices for both producers and consumers, and for a sustainable framework both in environmental and social terms.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe the focus of the resolution is precisely within that social framework. This resolution accompanies the agreement and will also be voted on tomorrow. I think the fact that it is basically focused on eradicating child labour is a major step, as it is one of the problems we face. Also, as the Commissioner said, we have been fighting the cause for some time, but the figures that were provided, of 124 million working children in the world, do not fill us with joy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Therefore, I think it is a very difficult struggle and it is one of those struggles that needs to be tackled from different fronts. I would like to state three specific fronts, which I believe are of vital importance. The first would be to make it compulsory for all states to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The second, which I believe is important and has not been mentioned here, would involve the application of advances in research and development in cultivation and collection techniques so that child labour is not required. Lastly, the drafting of a European standard for traceability and sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think it would be advisable for the Commission to try to study those proposals and I would also like to know the Commissioner’s opinion of them.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in contrast to the blessed sweetness of its finished product, the cocoa market has been practically cursed from the very start.</p>
      <p sl="it">When Francesco Carletti, a Florentine trader who was the first to circumnavigate the Earth using merchant ships between the late 1500s and early 1600s, brought cocoa to Europe, he denounced a business in which the main financing for investments in this plant was derived from the slave trade. Ever since then, the inhumane nature of the cocoa trade has persisted.</p>
      <p sl="it">If the product comes from Ghana or Côte d’Ivoire – which account for almost 60% of global output – then the use of children is a given, the majority of whom are less than 14 years old and often subject to genuine trafficking, which sees them taken away from their families in nearby countries and shut away in the plantations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Last week, I was in Côte d’Ivoire for an annual meeting of Euro-African liberal democrat members of parliament. There, I met the President of the main non-governmental organisation (NGO) that fights against the exploitation of children in cocoa plantations. The organisation is not without support, since even the wife of President Ouattara has come to its aid, opening the national surveillance committee against child exploitation and labour.</p>
      <p sl="it">That said, we need to move away from depending on volunteers, good examples and harsh words, and instead imbue the markets with a sense of social responsibility that has so far been lacking in the cocoa plantations, with their distinctive non-intensive, non-mechanical culture, and the aggravating factor of the use of pesticides that are harmful to workers.</p>
      <p sl="it">The agreement that has been signed – for which I should like to thank Mr Moreira and the Commission – is a step in the right direction, making the chocolate supply chain more transparent, involving NGOs and promoting fairer prices around the world. Since the EU controls most of the votes of importer countries in international cocoa organisations, it has a special responsibility to put the agreement quickly into action and use it as a way to make the production of this popular treat more humane.</p>
      <p sl="it">As significant as it is, however, this agreement alone will not suffice. We also need consumers to be more aware so that they can make ethical purchases, while also promoting the production and sale of fair trade chocolate, which guarantees prices for producers and that no children were exploited in the plantations of Africa during the process. The EU can do much more in this area, including by setting out regulations on (European) certification that has so far been a private initiative.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana are responsible for 70% of the cocoa produced globally and the European Union imports 80% of its cocoa from West Africa.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr Moreira’s resolution is a good one. It highlights one of two ways in which we can prevent child labour. One of those two ways is ensuring greater cooperation, by exchanging know-how, by ensuring that everyone works closely together and, indeed, by ensuring that the distribution sector shuns any producers who use child labour, at any stage of the cocoa production process, without giving them a second chance.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the second method, ladies and gentlemen, is ensuring fair, good prices. And the International Cocoa Agreement ought to do more about that. It ought to have the clout and the teeth to do something about that because, let us face it, if we have good prices, adults can earn their own money. If prices are low, then we have poverty. Poverty leads to child labour, so ensuring fair prices is an absolute necessity and is a central plank of this debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is important that on the second occasion in only a short period of time, the European Parliament is condemning the abuse of children who are used as cheap labour or slaves. We are in favour of this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">Nevertheless, in the Committee on International Trade, we had a shameful debate about whether we should condemn only forced child labour or also child labour under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p sl="de">In two areas, we may be forced to take a step backwards and, therefore, we need to resolve the issues involved. Mr Sturdy, recital E, which has been tabled by your group, gives the impression that the hard work done by children on the cocoa plantations is harmless. These children are being deprived of the opportunity to take part in education and their future is being taken away from them. We should delete this paragraph.</p>
      <p sl="de">Ms Köstinger and the other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which tabled recital D, want Parliament to turn a blind eye to the fact that children are being abducted and sold in West Africa to do hard and dangerous forced labour on the cocoa plantations. This is the appalling reality in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana in particular, as has already been mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="de">I recommend that you watch the documentary ‘The Dark Side of Chocolate’, which reveals that a child costs EUR 230. The children are being abducted from Mali and the International Labour Organisation estimates that there are more than 12 000 children without relations working on the Ivorian plantations. The next time we eat chocolate, we should specifically ask ourselves how many children have suffered to give us this pleasure. We must take a much more decisive approach to combating this problem.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we know that the cocoa sector is under pressure. As a result of the growing demand for chocolate from Asian countries, for example, more cocoa is needed and this, when combined with crop failures, could lead to a shortage of 1 million tonnes of cocoa within a few years. This is the total annual production of the largest producer country, Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the EU should not overlook the growing influence that the Ivorian Government is exerting on the domestic cocoa market. For example, because of the agricultural reform under way in the country, the 2012 to 2013 cocoa harvest was sold early in secret auctions. The millions of cocoa producers and the millions of workers who depend on chocolate production are, in many cases, working in inhumane conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">Although the EU is making a commitment to introducing social improvements and bringing an end to child labour as part of this agreement, the concern is that the improvements will only take place on paper and that the EU, as the world’s largest consumer of chocolate, will simply be absolving itself of responsibility for the situation. Instead, we should be focusing on certified, sustainable cocoa production.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this dossier presents us with a dilemma. On the one hand, we are opposed to all child labour. I must make it quite clear that, as the father of four children, I feel quite ill at the thought of what other children have to do to enable my children to have a cup of a chocolate drink in the morning.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, on the other hand, we cannot deny the fact that we need to put these countries in the position where they can introduce minimum social standards, find the funding for schools and education and establish social security systems. The dilemma we find ourselves in is that if we do not trade with these countries, then they will not earn the money to introduce all the developments that we would like to see. If we do trade with these countries, then we are faced with our current dilemma, which is intolerable. This is why I very much welcome this agreement.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to my fellow Members who have looked at this subject in detail in the committee. I am firmly convinced that this agreement is a move in the right direction. We are not afraid to express our criticisms, but we are not saying right from the outset: ‘We will not trade with you unless you put your house in order’. Instead, we are attempting to draw up a realistic, joint timetable to help these countries to resolve this dilemma. We have a joint interest not only in enjoying a good bar of chocolate or a cup of a chocolate drink, but, much more importantly, in ensuring a positive future for the children in these countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the goals of the agreement are all highly commendable and it should therefore be adopted. However, we cannot forget the big social question that cuts across this sector: a trade that improves the quality of its product, offers fair prices and develops the industry cannot fail to bring about an improvement in the economic status and living conditions of 5.5 million smallholders and the 14 million workers who depend on cocoa production.</p>
      <p sl="it">Since the European cocoa industry is the biggest in the world, we must urge our processing companies to commit to fighting the exploitation of children and for a sustainable and fair cocoa supply chain. That is what this resolution sets out to achieve and that is why it deserves our support.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, according to UNICEF, there are roughly 158 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 who work, which is one child in six worldwide. Millions of children work in conditions which put their health at risk by actually bringing them into contact with various harmful chemicals. In West Africa alone, more than 100 000 children toil under the harshest working conditions in the cocoa fields, with 10 000 children being victims of human trafficking. The low sale prices offered for cocoa force farmers to use child labour, which has far-reaching consequences for the children’s health and their schooling.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that access to education is a fundamental condition for reducing poverty and ending child exploitation. The EU has several necessary instruments available for putting an end to these practices. I should mention in this regard the possibility of suspending trade preference agreements as part of the GSP, as well as the need for all trade agreements with third countries to include provisions for abolishing child labour.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, like others, I, of course, support the International Cocoa Agreement. I think that it will help in terms of the social and environmental stability of the cocoa industry, but I also express grave concern at the existence of child labour in the industry. Let us be clear, though: the responsibility for tackling this issue does not lie with the European Parliament or with consumers in Europe, but with the industry itself. Over the last 10 years, the industry has made EUR 700 billion. That is a phenomenal sum of money, and the industry spent precisely 0.0075% of that investing in its workers’ working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The industry has a responsibility to provide schools for the children that it exploits. It has a responsibility to improve factories and conditions to make sure that the health of workers is protected. As I said, I welcome this agreement, but, in the end, the best way forward is for us to continue to buy and support Fair Trade products.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, as a crop that is grown on more than 8 million hectares of tropical land in forty countries, cocoa brings gains to the countries that cultivate, process and consume it. This is, above all, a sector on which the livelihoods of 50 million people around the world depend. I therefore consider it essential to adopt a transparent legal framework to ensure much more equitable conditions in the global chain – from producers, through intermediaries and exporters, to end users. Sustainable world trade in cocoa must be based at all stages of the chain on the principles of economic viability, and on respect for social and environmental standards.</p>
      <p sl="sk">For this reason, I firmly believe that a fair price for cocoa and the related fair revenues in particular for producers, who are often small farmers in developing countries, will help to resolve problems as well as issues relating to the unfair exploitation of child labour in this sector.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, chocolate and cocoa are something to be enjoyed not just by children, but also by adults. It is true that we are now in Strasbourg, but we are often in Brussels, where many people like to buy Belgian chocolate and to give it as a gift. Most of them do not think about where the cocoa comes from, under what conditions it is cultivated, and how the chocolate is manufactured.</p>
      <p sl="de">This debate has already made it clear that we must understand that the cocoa which we import has, in many cases, been produced using child labour.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Ms Köstinger has said, this is not just about finding out whether the children are there with or without their families and whether or not forced labour is involved. We must also be aware that the conditions under which these children work are damaging to their health. Cocoa is produced under conditions which are extremely harmful to health, including that of children. We need to stop this from happening.</p>
      <p sl="de">We must do everything we can to buy cocoa fairly from countries like Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire which are attempting to bring about better living conditions for their people. This has already been said on several occasions and, therefore, I think that introducing a quality mark would be the right approach to take. I am pleased that there is widespread agreement in Parliament on this subject.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I think there has been a great convergence of views during the debate. It is true that cocoa is a great product. It is also true that for many countries, such as Côte d’Ivoire, it is an important product for the economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fair trade should be practised and a fair price should be paid for the product. It should also be the industry’s responsibility to ensure that the products they sell are not tainted and use sustainable labour practices. It is also important that we include all elements of the fight against poverty in the same package; that is what we are doing in Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and other countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">But further measures are needed to address the problem of child labour. I will just recall a couple of them: the European Union is conducting a lobbying campaign to support the ratification of ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and two optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p sl="en">Child protection with regard to child labour has been identified as an EU priority in a number of the human rights country strategies that the EU has been drawing up. This is a very important point because we are engaging in political dialogue with our developing partners. This is where we could and should address this issue, with the aim of ensuring that countries also see it as a clear priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has also produced its Guide to Socially Responsible Procurement, which pays attention to labour practices. There are also relevant projects and programmes in development assistance. Some of these are specifically targeted at child labour; for example, the EUR 14 million TACKLE project on child labour and education which the ILO is carrying out in 14 ACP countries, and last year’s EUR 10 million call for proposals to combat child labour under the ‘Investing in People’ programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">More specifically in the cocoa sector, the EDF Cocoa Sector Support programme effectively contributed to improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and making cocoa production more sustainable in Ghana.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to assure all of you that the Commission is fully committed to maintaining policy coherence in all its initiatives related to trade, development, human rights and corporate social responsibility, bearing in mind that in developing countries, the problem of child labour cannot be just looked at in isolation as a separate problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">Taking into account the importance of ensuring that trade agreements include effective provisions on poverty reduction and the promotion of decent work and safe working conditions, the Commission is concretely looking into the issue of traceability of goods produced using forced child labour.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I should like to thank all those who took part in this debate and, in particular, to thank the Commission for its final commitments as regards combating child labour; they are welcome, they are timely and we would like to tell the Commission that we want to believe in them. In fact, I think it is important, first of all, to use our political clout to encourage these countries to ratify and actually to implement the International Labour Organisation agreements on child labour. Secondly, development programmes should be used to make gains regarding the sustainability of the cocoa sector. Thirdly, the idea of making cocoa traceable should be explored, so as to create a ‘child labour-free cocoa’ label, which could be a means of asserting the importance of this issue in cocoa production.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would add one more thing: this matter cannot be absent from the EU’s international trade relations or from international trade agreements. I believe that this matter cannot be absent from discussions on economic partnership agreements with cocoa-producing countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. To this end, the EU has a huge array of means at its disposal that it cannot fail to use in a wide-ranging and holistic way. This includes one that we have omitted but which I do not want to fail to mention, which is corporate social responsibility, which the Commissioner also mentioned and which seems to me to be important, given that a significant proportion of the major players in this area are European companies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It would reflect very badly on us if they also failed to play their part in combating this scourge.</p>

      <p sl="ga">For the past number of years, the media are drawing the attention of the public and politicians to the issue of child labour. According to a recent study, however, the sector’s efforts in tackling child labour have been unfair and imperfect and nothing has happened in the case of 97% of farmers in Côte d’Ivoire. Unicef estimate that half a million children are engaged in labour on farms in Côte d’Ivoire, a country that produces 40% of the world’s cocoa. Some 80% of the EU’s cocoa comes from West Africa and the European cocoa industry is the world’s largest cocoa industry. Therefore, the EU has a duty to ensure the sustainability of the cocoa sector, and, morally and practically, issues in relation to child labour must be central to EU trade agreements. It is a positive aspect of the International Cocoa Agreement that Articles 42 and 43 of the agreement relate to child labour. However, the Commission must look at labelling that declares that products ‘free of child labour’ are being imported to ensure that the voluntary conventions in relation to putting an end to the worst kinds of child labour are being properly implemented.</p>

      <p sl="it">The International Cocoa Agreement 2010 will replace the existing 2001 agreement to which the EU is a party. Overall, the agreement intends to bring more transparency and sustainability into a sector on which 50 million livelihoods depend throughout the world. In particular, it aims to create conditions for fairer and more sustainable global trade in cocoa by strengthening international cooperation. The EU imports over 80% of its cocoa from West Africa. The European chocolate industry is the largest worldwide. Over 90% of the world’s cocoa is cultivated by 5.5 million smallholders, with a further 14 million rural workers directly dependent on its production. I believe that this agreement could have a positive impact on all actors participating in the cocoa economy and I hope that it will translate into tangible long-term benefits for small-scale farmers. Unfortunately, the issue of child labour in the fields is widespread and, even though a lot of child labour is done within the family framework, the situation is worrying. Being the world’s main importer and consumer of cocoa, the EU should actively commit to resolve this problem as a matter of urgency.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Once again, we are led to defend the working conditions of an entire sector. I would remind you that cocoa is one of the primary materials most in demand internationally, after coffee and sugar, and most of the added value in the production chain goes to the countries of the North. Out of the overall production costs of a bar of chocolate, less than 5% goes to the countries of the South. The major chocolate manufacturers would therefore appear to have forgotten that they are wholly dependent on the millions of small-scale cocoa producers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, the International Labour Organisation estimates that 215 million children around the world are obliged to work, with over 250 000 of them working in West Africa’s cocoa plantations, while 15 000 have been reduced to a state of slavery. The reason is simple: as they are unable to make a profit from their activity, the producers are forced to look for cheap labour. We must therefore demand of the Commission effective legislation to combat the forced labour of children in the cocoa sector and to put pressure on all of the players in the supply chain to ensure that the farmers are able to obtain equitable returns from their activity.</p>

      <p sl="de">Child labour is one of the most appalling aspects of a purely profit-oriented economy. It is highly unjust and also unwise because it permanently destroys the future prospects of the societies where it takes place. Responsible people have spoken out against it on numerous occasions by drawing attention to the scandalous conditions and bringing about improvements by means of legislation. As a result, child labour has been almost entirely eradicated in Europe. Therefore, bringing an end to child labour in other parts of the world is undoubtedly a legitimate goal, in particular, with regard to important everyday consumer products in Europe, such as the chocolate which is produced from cocoa. The condemnation of child labour in this sector which accompanies the recommendation on the Council decision concerning the cocoa agreement is therefore another important step in the right direction. It should act as an incentive for us to pay close attention to ensuring that child labour is outlawed in all the European Union’s trade relationships.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Commissioner, I am grateful to this Parliament for taking the initiative in organising this debate and in drawing attention to this important issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish today to thank in particular the co-chairs, Ms Schaldemose, Baroness Ludford, Mr Busuttil and Ms Matias for their leadership and, of course, the members of Parliament’s working group on diabetes, which sponsored the motion for a resolution before you. They continue to work tirelessly to raise the profile of the effects of diabetes on the health of citizens across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Throughout Europe, chronic diseases in general pose an enormous challenge to patients and their relatives and society at large. This calls for a new and coordinated approach and increased cooperation. The biggest challenge in this context arises from the fact that we live longer and do not live healthily enough. This means that ever more Europeans develop diabetes and other chronic diseases.</p>
      <p sl="en">The implications are obvious: mounting pressure on our health sector and a situation where fewer young people are entering the labour market to pay for rising public costs.</p>
      <p sl="en">Diabetes is one of the four most common chronic diseases. At present, around 30 million people in the European Union are diagnosed with diabetes. This figure is expected to rise to around 40 million by around 2030. Around 10% of the EU Member States’ health care budget is spent on the direct treatment of diabetes. This amounts to about EUR 80 billion, which does not even include the cost of treating associated illnesses or complications.</p>
      <p sl="en">At present, diabetes can be neither reversed nor cured. Current therapies do not prevent the progression of the disease. Equally, they cannot eliminate the threat of long-term complications. The growing burden of diabetes must therefore be addressed through prevention, early detection, effective management, education and research.</p>
      <p sl="en">Prevention can be very effective. According to the World Health Organisation, Type 2 diabetes – which represents between 85 and 95% of diabetes cases – can be prevented by basic changes in lifestyle, including healthy diet and regular physical activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">What can be done within the EU to face up to this challenge? Health issues are, first and foremost, a matter for Member States. The European Union has only limited competence in this area, but that clearly does not mean that we are inactive. In December 2010, the Council launched a reflection process on the issue of chronic diseases. It invited Member States and the Commission to identify options to optimise the response to chronic diseases and spur cooperation among Member States. This process is carried out in close cooperation with the relevant stakeholders and will result in a reflection paper. Work is ongoing and is being managed at senior level within the appropriate Council bodies. It is expected to be finalised next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Danish Presidency is fully supportive of this process and will use its time in office to advance it as much as possible. In fact, chronic disease is one of the main priorities of the Danish Presidency in the field of health. It will be on the agenda of the informal meeting of health ministers in Horsens in Denmark this April, where the question of patient empowerment will be in focus. Patient empowerment is also the topic of a conference organised under the Danish Presidency, which will take place on 11 and 12 April in Copenhagen.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am also pleased to announce that the European Diabetes Leadership Forum will take place on 25 and 26 April this year. A wide range of stakeholders, including politicians, government officials, health NGOs, health care professionals and business organisations, will be represented at that forum, and the Danish Presidency is proud to support it. The Presidency is convinced that these events will not only bring together experts across a range of fields; they will also support the reflection process on chronic diseases under way in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">Considerable efforts are under way to address the challenges of chronic diseases, including diabetes. The work in the Council is one of many strands of work which are contributing to these efforts – but more could and should be done. Our discussion this afternoon, and the resolution which you will vote on tomorrow, will help increase awareness of this challenge to our collective health.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore look forward to hearing your views on this issue and to reporting back to the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Parliament for its commitment to improving the lives of people with diabetes. The European Commission shares your concern. Diabetes translates to great suffering for over 32 million Europeans and their families.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission believes we need to attack the root causes of diabetes further. As such, the European Commission fully endorses your call to Member States to develop strategies on diet and exercise to prevent Type 2 diabetes, as expressed in your resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">We know that not all diabetes is preventable, but when it comes to Type 2 diabetes, we do know what the main causes are: being overweight, obesity and a lack of physical activity. The rate of obesity has more than doubled over the past 20 years. More than half of adult Europeans are overweight or obese. One in four European children aged six to nine are already overweight and, as such, at greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. This is why the focus of Commission action to address diabetes is to tackle its main causes: being overweight, obesity and the lack of physical activity.</p>
      <p sl="en">It was in this spirit that, back in 2007, the Commission developed a strategy on nutrition and physical activity to support national efforts to prevent obesity. The strategy works first by fostering an exchange of experiences amongst Member States, encouraging joint approaches and coordinated actions. This includes joint food reformulation approaches, for example, for key nutrients such as salt.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, it mobilises partners across society to take action, through the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, which, very importantly, also includes diabetes organisations.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this framework, the Commission encourages action by food producers, media and advertisers on food reformulation and commercial communication standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, it mobilises other policies towards this cause. I will give you some examples. Through the EU research policy, the Commission has co-funded research on diabetes and obesity, worth EUR 340 million in the sixth and seventh framework programmes for research. Since 2007, over EUR 207 million has been devoted to diabetes and obesity research.</p>
      <p sl="en">We further support research and innovation to address diet-related diseases more generally, with the Joint Programming Initiative ‘A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life’. As such, we welcome your resolution’s call for coordination of diabetes research across the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the EU agriculture policy, the Commission brings fruits and vegetables to millions of school children every year via the School Fruit Scheme. Through the EU education policy, the Commission is also supporting physical activity with initiatives such as the EU guidelines for physical activity. Finally – and it is important to mention this – in the field of audiovisual media services, the Commission seeks to reduce the pressure of food marketing and advertising on children.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition, the Commission has also financed action through the health programme to support Member States’ responses to diabetes prevention and care and to improve European capacity for monitoring the diabetes epidemic. Special attention is given to juvenile diabetes and factors related to childhood.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is persuaded that the EU framework programme for research and also the health programme contribute to research breakthroughs in the prevention and treatment of diabetes and in better understanding the interaction of diabetes with other diseases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your resolution further calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure adequate follow up of the UN summit on non-communicable diseases. In this regard, I would like to inform you that the Commission has already launched a reflection process, together with Member States and stakeholders, to identify areas for added-value action at EU level.</p>
      <p sl="en">I trust you will recognise the Commission’s commitment to addressing the diabetes epidemic and to supporting Member States in their efforts to prevent and manage diabetes. The Commission will carefully study your resolution and how to accommodate your request for further action.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission agrees with the European Parliament about the need to do more on diabetes: for example, to prevent diabetes, in particular, amongst children and adolescents; to support patients, and enable them to live a fulfilling life; and to offer the best available diagnosis and treatment options to people affected, to minimise complications and the risk of associated diseases.</p>
      <p sl="en">This being said, as you know, the Commission believes that it can provide most added value by focusing work on the challenges and causes common to many chronic diseases such as obesity, rather than focusing on the individual diseases one by one.</p>
      <p sl="en">By addressing obesity, we address diabetes and many other chronic diseases at the same time. This is why the European Commission favours a horizontal holistic approach instead of specific strategies for individual diseases. It is in this spirit that the Commission takes note of the fact that the resolution calls on the Commission to develop and implement a dedicated EU diabetes strategy and to monitor Member State action in this area.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, let me assure you that by addressing the risk factors, developing the evidence base and by supporting Member States, the Commission can, and will, continue to play its full role in addressing diabetes.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, I am very pleased that we are holding this debate, since we have been working for two and a half years to hold this debate in this hall and obtain this resolution. This satisfaction is also shared by my colleagues who work on this subject, and who are present here today. As has been stated, 32 million citizens suffer from diabetes; apart from this, another 32 million people suffer from hyperglycaemia and risk suffering serious problems during their lives if they develop diabetes. Allow me to add that up to 50% of those who suffer from diabetes are not even aware of their condition. I am not a doctor, but there is one thing that is very clear to me: we are facing a very serious problem. And it is for this reason that we are meeting here today to discuss the problems posed by diabetes, which is affecting the lives of millions of citizens. It is our duty to work together to find effective solutions to these problems.</p>
      <p sl="mt">It has often been said that the potential financial burden which tackling such a problem would involve would be too hefty, but I am of the opinion that this argument is not valid in the context of diabetes. Why? If we control diabetes today, we will be saving on expenses in the future. Therefore, it is good that the Danish Presidency has listed this subject as one of its priorities, and I hereby call on the Commission to do more, first and foremost, by creating a strategy to combat diabetes, and also by encouraging the Member States to create national strategies in this regard.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and Mr Wammen for their positive contributions and for their support for the fact that we really must take more action than we are currently doing when it comes to diabetes.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would just like to reiterate a few figures: 32 million EU citizens already have diabetes today and a further 32 million have the early stages of diabetes. The majority of them have Type 2 diabetes. What is interesting – and it has actually already been said – is the fact that we are, in fact, able to prevent Type 2 diabetes. I am therefore extremely pleased to have your support for the need for us to do more.</p>
      <p sl="da">Of course, it is also a question of getting to grips with the causes of diabetes, including obesity. A great deal more research can be done into the causes and also into how we can get citizens to lead healthier lives. However, I also believe that the Commission can do more than that. We can also ensure that we have common standards for how we collect data on the status of the situation with diabetes and the other types of diseases. This sort of data collection is, in fact, necessary in order for us to see whether any progress is actually being made in these areas, in which we are now implementing a large number of political initiatives.</p>
      <p sl="da">With regard to the Member States, Mr Wammen, I would like to say that I am pleased to hear your assurance that the Council will give its attention to this matter, but one example of something important that I believe can be done in the Member States is to update the national action plans for diabetes. After all, that will help us to focus on what we should do for citizens at a national level.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would therefore like to thank you for your assurance and for the fact that you will be involved in getting something done for European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the diabetes time bomb has stopped ticking and has actually exploded, so I am delighted that the Danish Presidency – as well as Parliament (where we also have Danish influence) – are supportive of a specific focus on diabetes. The fact that it accounts for 10% of our health care costs is reason enough. While the onset of Type 1 diabetes in children and teenagers is quite sudden, Type 2 diabetes is often not diagnosed until it has been present for some years. This leads to complications such as blindness and kidney and heart disease, which are both devastating and expensive and account for a lot of those costs. As the Commissioner noted, not all diabetes is preventable, and I would specifically mention those 10 to 15% who have Type 1. Even tiny babies are getting it. An exclusively horizontal approach does tend to ignore Type 1.</p>
      <p sl="de">There seem to be two main explanations for the lack of urgency to date on diabetes. One is, I think, the perception that people get along with it OK: they just have to be a bit careful about what they eat, and they do not die from it. In fact, some do die directly from diabetes, but many more die early from the devastating side-effects that I have just mentioned. I think a second reason for inaction is prejudice – the perception that it is only about a lazy lifestyle. Again, I think an exclusively horizontal approach reinforces that.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission promised only to reflect. I think we are going to need a lot more, and we need to push the Commission firmly to actually develop a diabetes strategy in the form of an EU Council recommendation. I do not accept that the horizontal approach and the specific focus are mutually exclusive.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the European Parliament indicated in a resolution as early as 15 September 2011, in the run-up to the UN summit on non-communicable diseases, that it is entirely in Europe’s interests to adopt a comprehensive approach and, moreover, to contribute additional input to the policies of competent authorities in Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In October 2010, we also organised a joint meeting in the European Parliament of the Diabetes Working Group, the MEP Heart Group, Members against Cancer (MAC) and the MEP Group for Kidney Health, of which I am chair, which also stressed the importance of coordinated action. Prevention is essential and, indeed, also possible, because the risk factors for all these diseases are already known.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With that in mind, I therefore somewhat regret the fact that members here seem to have abandoned that joint approach to a certain extent and prepared a resolution dealing with diabetes alone. The added value of last year’s resolution escapes me somewhat, because other diseases which are also non-communicable, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases, have been disregarded to some extent. However, I have no problems, obviously, with the contents of the resolution and we will therefore support it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, as has already been mentioned, diabetes affects more than 30 million people in Europe. Those are the figures of an epidemic, in fact. That is why I believe there is also justification for a specific resolution on diabetes; all the more so because this is the first time that Parliament has addressed this issue. This is the result of a collective effort; an effort that does not cancel out the work done until now on chronic illnesses: on the contrary, it reinforces it and reinforces this capacity that we have for collective intervention.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We have around 325 000 deaths per year associated with diabetes because we know that diabetes is the principal cause of, for example, heart attacks, blindness, amputations and failures of vital organs. In my opinion, we have two choices in the face of these figures. The first is to say that it is not that serious; that we can get on alright with this and that each government should look out for itself. The second is to say that the lack of a European strategy in this area is part of the problem. I believe we have much to do in this regard. We also have much to do on early diagnosis, on coordination and on investment in research. That is why this resolution represents a first step in working together to this end.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Awareness not only of the integrated management of diseases, but also of prevention, since it is actually extremely important that citizens are aware of what they can do early on and, of course, what they can do later, when the disease develops. What this change to their way of life means. Not just taking medication, but actually changing their lifestyle.</p>
      <p sl="sl">This is also an opportunity for civil associations, which are especially strong in this area, to also play a role in raising awareness among citizens, in cooperation with the experts, of course. This is an opportunity for politicians and experts to find their synergy together with responsible and disciplined individuals.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, the climate of economic crisis and budgetary cuts affects public health care and leaves research centres without funding. This is the case with the Prince Felipe centre, which specialises in diabetes and is located in the autonomous region in which I live, and this resolution is very welcome, it is very appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="es">We need a single European strategy for diabetes and we need a recommendation from the Council telling States that they should step up research, even on stem cells, that they should coordinate their results to make the best use of them, and that they should establish programmes for healthy eating and lifestyle habits. In summary, we must put people’s health before anything else and, in this case, research, coordinate and develop national programmes that are coordinated by the Commission to obtain data about diabetes and, in that way, protect the lives of Europeans, and ensure their quality of life.</p>
      <p sl="es">If we devote more funds to this, maybe some will take a little longer to recover, but those who currently have problems will definitely have a better quality of life and we, as States, as a Council and as a Commission, will be fulfilling one of our obligations, which is to watch over the health of our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, today, we are discussing an important issue. The United Nations General Assembly has confirmed that diabetes is one of the four major non-communicable diseases in the world. We can say that it is a global problem and already an epidemic. The figures are really shocking: 33 million people with diabetes in the European Union – 10% of the entire population. At least another 32 million are at risk of developing diabetes. Diabetes causes significant losses not just in terms of health deterioration but the high costs of treatment. In many Member States, the cost of treating diabetes represents more than 10% of health care spending. It is also a major burden for people with diabetes themselves. It is therefore essential to take and implement effective action immediately with regard to European Union and Member State measures to address diabetes. So far, little more than half of all Member States have appropriate strategies: first steps, public education and information on the risk factors; the introduction of health, prevention and screening programmes. There must be a focused and coordinated operation covering the efforts of institutions developing health policy, the European Union’s scientific potential and non-governmental organisations. I congratulate the principal rapporteur, Simon Busuttil, and hope that following the adoption of the resolution with really comprehensive proposals, we will be able to combat diabetes in the European Union more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the proposed resolution calls for the coordination of procedures at the level of the Member States and of the European Union, but only indirectly mentions the responsibility of the individual. We do not have a mandate to release citizens from this responsibility, but the degree of solidarity in public health insurance systems should reflect demonstrably harmful lifestyle choices. Similarly, we must respect the decisions of Member States, because health care is within their remit. The financial possibilities open to the Member States vary, so, for example, Slovakia today cannot afford the levels of funding for the treatment of diabetes enjoyed by the countries of old Europe. I therefore agree with the recommendations in the Joint Declaration on enhancing the exchange of information and best practices. This applies especially to Type 2 diabetes.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, thank you for seeing to it that this important topic is on today’s agenda. I would like to highlight a fact that you already know: that about one in four people with diabetes do not actually know that they have the disease. In the Netherlands, approximately 1 million people out of a total population of 16 million have diabetes and a quarter of them do not know it yet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is therefore, as you say, extremely important to work on prevention, on the many things that people can do at home to reduce their risk. To that end, we need a lot of innovation and a lot of high-tech advances. It is now, at last, possible to use your smartphone to keep track of your diabetes. In other words, you can use it to find out what kind of medication you need. It is possible that, in the future, people will also be able to receive better long-distance care and will find it easier to do a test at home to find out whether or not they have diabetes.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There are, therefore, opportunities for an innovative and high-tech approach and that ought to be included in the active and healthy ageing strategy and, in particular, in the digital agenda. In addition, it is important that we also work on making these products more accessible to other countries because, at present, you could hardly describe free movement of medical innovations as one of our strengths. We could be cleverer and more efficient in our provision of care, as well as doing it more cheaply, and we also need more effective support for people who do not yet know that they have diabetes.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, if we analyse closely the figures on the incidence of diabetes among the population of the European Union, whether it be Type 1 or Type 2, it is obvious that serious efforts need to be made to combat this disease. I, too, wish to urge prevention, both because prevention is best in terms of cost efficiency and because, unfortunately, in the case of diabetes, as with other chronic diseases, we are currently focusing more on treatment and less on prevention. Promoting a healthy lifestyle and combating risk factors are vital measures for tackling this disease.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition, the fact that we are now debating the Horizon 2020 research programme provides an excellent opportunity for improving the system, ensuring better coordination of the research being conducted into diabetes and for guaranteeing the necessary funding and infrastructure. We need a European strategy focusing on prevention, early and effective diagnosis, management of this disease, informing the public and carrying out relevant research.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I wish to speak about child diabetes, an issue which I have an additional personal reason for monitoring very closely: eighteen months ago, my niece, an only child now six years old, was diagnosed as having Type 1 diabetes.</p>
      <p sl="el">I will never forget her parents’ initial efforts; I will never forget her father’s efforts to try and agree with and explain to his insurance fund that it should cover the special equipment needed by the child to measure her blood sugar, because it had not been included in the agreed arrangement.</p>
      <p sl="el">I shall never forget that, when they took the child to the playschool which had accepted her after the diagnosis and on the doctor’s advice, some people tried to convince the parents that the child start school later, so that she could, in their words, stabilise.</p>
      <p sl="el">What I want to say is that there is still a great deal of ignorance about these issues in modern Europe even today. There are prejudices and misunderstandings that ultimately result in discrimination which, as we all know full well, is not allowed. We therefore need to make very serious and intense efforts in the information sector.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the growing epidemic of diabetes is a serious problem in civilised society, and the EU really cannot ignore its increased incidence. More than 90% of cases concern Type 2 diabetes, in which the loss of ability to utilise glucose is due to poor diet and physical inactivity. This disease, which, until recently, was mostly prevalent in adults, is now also increasing significantly among children.</p>
      <p sl="sk">As we cannot yet cure diabetes and the disease will have an increasingly detrimental impact on the patient’s life up to the time of death, our actions must be oriented to effective prevention, which entails changing harmful eating habits and increasing people’s physical activity. By levying special charges for the consumption of health-threatening products, such as tobacco and alcohol, for example, we could contribute to greater consumer orientation towards healthy, natural food products. We could then use the funds raised to encourage people to undertake regular, light sport for fitness purposes.</p>
      <p sl="sk">There are certainly other options for bringing about positive changes to current habits, but the Commission must know how to work with them creatively and then to introduce them into people’s lives effectively.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the incidence of diabetes in EU Member States is growing ever greater, affecting the lives of approximately 32 million people, which represents nearly 10% of the European population. Diabetes is also the cause of fully 325 000 deaths in the EU. Type 2 diabetes results in a decreased life expectancy of five to 10 years, and Type 1 diabetes, of one to about 20 years. By 2025, the number of people suffering from diabetes will increase by a further 16%.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The costs involved in treating EU citizens suffering from diabetes account, on average, for 10-18.5% of the total health expenditure in a given country.

      <p sl="fi">Health is like trust. We often only understand how precious it is when we have lost it. Diabetes is one of the commonest non-communicable diseases. It affects more than 32 million EU citizens, which is to say, almost 10% of the Union’s entire population. Diabetes affects quality of life. It also leads to other diseases and raises the mortality rate.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to combat diabetes and other diseases that affect the population. We need action at national, but also at European, level. At present, just 16 EU countries have a national action programme to prevent diabetes. The other 11 countries need to produce one as soon as possible. Merely a desire to eat and live healthily is not always enough. People also need information on healthy lifestyles. In this way, Type 2 diabetes, in particular, can be prevented. More research is needed to recognise the risk factors associated with Type 1 diabetes – hereditary factors, for example. Finally, I would like to say that we decision makers should also have the courage to take decisions that support healthy choices.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In recent years, an increase in the incidence of diabetes has been noted. The problem affects a growing number of people and, in the European Union, over 32 million people suffer from the disease. These figures are disturbing, and therefore I think that an EU strategy on diabetes, including its prevention, diagnosis and management, as well as education and research, needs to be implemented as soon as possible. According to statistics, by 2025, around 4 million people in Poland will be diabetic. It is therefore clear how important it is for Member States to develop and implement national programmes to prevent diabetes, because this disease is one of the most significant burdens on public health and health care, not only medically, but also socially and economically.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I would like to highlight the importance of the resolution in addressing the EU diabetes epidemic in the context of the European health agenda. Diabetes affects more than 32 million EU citizens, or almost 10% of the Union’s entire population. Diabetes is one of the non-communicable diseases responsible for 87% of deaths in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Type 2 diabetes is a preventable illness. It is the practice at present, however, to begin to treat it at a fairly late stage, and this has serious effects on health. Early diagnosis should be the priority in national diabetes programmes, so that treatment can be started in the disease’s early stages. In addition, the Commission should initiate measures to establish a Europe-wide diabetes strategy.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Last month, the UN General Assembly adopted a declaration on non-communicable diseases. It serves as a reminder to decision makers around the world of the significance of chronic diseases for their health policy agenda. The main guidelines contained in the declaration relate to more advice and guidance, economic policy instruments, the robust promotion of healthy food, and access to health care and services for all. Parliament’s resolution also makes reference to this declaration, and it is important that the recommendations in the UN declaration are taken seriously.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although there is no cure for diabetes, it can often be prevented. In 2007, the Commission published its strategy on nutrition and obesity, which emphasised how clear and accurate information about food can help prevent diseases such as diabetes. So, five years on, what has the strategy achieved? It has promoted voluntary codes and a self-regulatory approach to the advertising of foodstuffs to children. However, according to the Commission’s own progress report, some Member States have not yet adopted a voluntary code, whilst others have no mechanism in place to check whether their code is being implemented.</p>
      <p sl="en">Unhealthy foods which increase the risk of obesity and diabetes are still being aggressively marketed to children. The strategy on nutrition also highlighted the role of the Health Claims Regulation in ensuring that consumers are not misled by inaccurate or confusing claims. But this regulation cannot function properly because the Commission has not yet proposed key elements of it. So the health claims legislation is not yet in operation and, in the meantime, junk food continues to be advertised to children. The Commission and the Member States must re-think their approach to information and education about food if they are serious about tackling diabetes.</p>

      <p sl="sk">In my country, Slovakia, our life expectancy lags behind the EU average by almost five years for both men and women. I therefore welcome any initiative to promote health that can also be implemented in national health promotion programmes. We are also observing an increase in the incidence and prevalence of diabetes in adults. Over the past 20 years, it has almost doubled, and is rising every year.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Given that there is currently no European strategy for tackling diabetes and a lack of funds for competitive research, it is up to the Member States to complement national health support programmes with diabetes programmes aimed at promoting health and bring about a gradual change in attitude regarding people’s own health. So that this does not happen only in national programmes, however, the Commission must draw up a targeted EU strategy in all respects concerning the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes, as well as research into the disease.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I think that now, when roughly 10% of the EU population has diabetes, we must assume the leading role at global level in looking for the most suitable solutions for reducing the incidence of diabetes. Some of the actions we need to take include allocating additional funds for measures to prevent diabetes among the population and identifying the most appropriate measures for encouraging consumers to have a healthier lifestyle. We would say that initial measures are being taken in this direction. I am referring here, in particular, not only to the regulation on nutritional and health claims made on foods, but also to the reform of the common agricultural policy, which offers an opportunity to increase the population’s access to healthier food.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In addition to taking preventive measures, we must consider the early detection of the disease and, by extension, the development of instruments for tackling the social inequalities among the population groups at risk. To achieve this, we need to have access to data on chronic diseases in Member States and get involved in cooperation because we can overcome scientific challenges only through joint efforts. Furthermore, we need to focus more on education and its role in selecting the healthiest models of consumption.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, Commissioner, the economic and financial crisis has been, and is being, expressed differently in the various Member States. This reflects the existing divergences and imbalances; it reflects the inequalities existing between the Member States. These inequalities are expressed in multiple ways. One of these concerns the capacity for accessing and using EU funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The countries with weaker economies, which need more EU funding, are often also those with the greatest difficulties in accessing these funds. For years, this resulted, in large measure, from the restrictions on public investment, imposed under the pretext of the Stability and Growth Pact, which made it hard to mobilise the required national effort. These restrictions are currently being greatly exacerbated by the IMF and EU programmes under way in countries like Portugal, Greece and Ireland.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The political choices set out in these programmes are leading the countries that have been bailed out and their populations into a tragic and profound economic recession, destroying a major part of their economic and social fabric, and affecting both their capacity for private investment – particularly, small and medium-sized enterprises – and public investment, which is and has been reduced to record lows in some cases.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The coastal communities most dependent on fishing cannot avoid this general framework. There is an aggravating factor in this specific case: years of decline and breakdown resulting from the specific changes that have occurred in this sector can be added to this general framework.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There has long been a need for this Commission proposal to increase EU cofinancing for these countries and to reduce correspondingly national contributions; it has come too late.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It has already been two years since the European Commission itself pointed out significant under-execution of the European Fisheries Fund. It even identified the causes of this under-execution. This proposal, then, has long been needed and has come regrettably late. For this reason, it is clear that the need to adopt it is urgent and we believe it is important to adopt it at first reading. However, despite this, let us not forget the limitations that this proposal also clearly demonstrates. I also wish to express some of these here, in the hope that the Commission will take due account of them.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We believe that the Commission should analyse the extent to which this change actually provides the Member States with the funds necessary for supporting projects and the recovery of their economies, as provided for in the Commission proposal. It should be noted that the restrictions imposed on investment by the bailout programmes could, even under the new conditions, continue to make it hard to mobilise the required national contribution of 15% and 40%, for eligible and ineligible regions respectively, under the umbrella of the Convergence Objective.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As such, we believe the Commission should consider the need to remove restrictions on investment, on the one hand, but also the possibility of reducing national cofinancing even further. Moreover, it should be stressed that the Commission proposal does not increase the budget available to each Member State. The practical result of this choice, as a result of the reduction in national contributions for the countries in the greatest difficulties, will be to channel an overall sum of investment into the sector that is comparatively smallest in relation to that which was initially envisaged. As a result, the prospects for growth opened up by the investment made in these Member States will be reduced. Once again, it is the principle of cohesion that could be under threat, so the Commission should consider the possibility of increasing the funds made available to these countries.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Furthermore, the rules for calculating deficits in public accounts should separate spending on investment from other public spending; the former should not be considered, so as not to prioritise so-called budgetary consolidation over economic growth, without which any consolidation will be rendered unviable in the medium and long term.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I shall conclude, Mr President, by asking you why the regulation establishing Union financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy has not been included in the Commission proposal. This regulation funds very important areas, such as the collection of data and scientific opinions, and the percentages of EU cofinancing in this area are generally low: 50% at most. Why was this regulation – and the measures that finance it – not also covered by the Commission proposal?</p>

    <intervention id="2-642-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Maria Damanaki" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is obvious that many of our Member States face a lot of difficulties relating to the economic crisis. I do not want to undermine the severity of the problems and, of course, I do not expect to solve these problems through today’s proposal. As you perhaps know, however, the Commission committed at the Euro summit of July 2011 to provide more liquidity to the Member States most affected by the crisis by increasing the cofinancing rates in EU Funds, and this proposal follows on from that.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the proposal is a positive measure: we are trying to facilitate the absorption of the funds. We are trying to help Member States facing difficulties, but, of course, the crisis, and all the problems deriving from it, are a very important issue that cannot be solved in the margins of this discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal is limited in scope, since the purpose of these amendments is specifically to provide more liquidity to Member States. Parliament and the Council have already adopted the necessary amendments for the European Regional Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development. Now this House will vote on similar amendments to the European Fisheries Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">The sustained financial and economic crisis is indeed increasing the pressure on national financial resources as Member States reduce their budgets. I share the rapporteur’s concerns about this. Ensuring the smooth implementation of national operational programmes adopted under EU funds is, therefore, of particular importance. The implementation of fisheries operational programmes, in particular, injects funds into the fisheries and aquaculture sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">We want to allow the most affected Member States – those that have received financial assistance under the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism or from the Balance of Payments mechanism – to continue to implement their European fisheries programmes on the ground and disburse funds to projects. To achieve this purpose, our proposal would allow the Commission to reimburse newly declared expenditure by an increased amount for the period in which a Member State was under these support mechanisms. This increased amount would be calculated by applying an additional 10 percentage points to the applicable cofinancing rates of each priority axis of the operational programmes.</p>
      <p sl="en">The total financial allocation for the period from the EFF to the countries and the programmes concerned will not change; the proposal will thus not affect the overall budget. Actually, the new budget is in front of this House, and you can discuss this greater issue in the framework of this discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">The cooperation between Parliament, Council and the Commission on this file has been excellent, since all parties were aware of the importance of adopting the proposal as quickly as possible. I expect that a positive vote in plenary will lead to the proposal’s imminent adoption, which will enable us to come to the assistance of those Member States that most need this facilitation as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, welcome Commissioner. I would like to express my satisfaction at the European Commission’s proposal of establishing more favourable conditions for Member States that are in serious difficulties, or under threat of such difficulties relating to their financial stability, to really benefit from the European Fisheries Fund (EFF). I second the rapporteur’s highlighting of the urgent need to adopt this proposal at first reading.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, I believe the proposal could and should have gone a little further. I believe there are two key issues to be taken into account in this context, which should not, in fact, be separated. Firstly, that it covers all measures that facilitate the increase in the rate of execution of the EFF; secondly, that it should focus on the possibility of revising the priorities of the EFF and even reprogramming it, so as to adapt it better to the real needs of a specific time and place. This is the only way it will be possible to achieve the fundamental objective of not only increasing execution rates, but also optimising results; that is, of promoting reproductive investments and guaranteeing a genuinely positive impact on fishing communities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In this context, I would highlight two key issues that correspond to the two aims I have just set out. The first of these is the requirement to take into consideration the fact that each community could have specific needs, to which the EFF should respond appropriately, such as modernising boats in terms of safety, hygiene and environmental best practices; in relation to this latter aspect, environmentally friendly fishing techniques and increasingly less polluting engines are particularly important. There should be provision for these actions.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is also important to take into account the resolution recently adopted by Parliament on the multifunctionality of fisheries and their capacity for producing public goods, which draws attention to the variety of activities downstream from fishing and to the sharing of benefits throughout society that results from it. It should, therefore, be possible to apply the funds flexibly and in a variety of areas.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, Commissioner, I unreservedly support this legislation with all my heart because it really is a demonstration of solidarity. The saving of vital resources, resources worth EUR 20 million in the case of Greece, is not the only positive point; the facility to access European resources acquired by these companies is also a positive point.</p>
      <p sl="el">Many countries have been hit by the crisis. The crisis has hit the whole of Europe and today, certain countries which are unable to give their contribution, have seen the ugly face of it. Reducing the own contribution rate will allow these countries to use these resources, resources which, in the case of Greece, total EUR 207 million; resources that could not otherwise be used.</p>
      <p sl="el">These resources offer an opportunity to finance the Fisheries Fund’s priorities, such as sustainable development, sustainable fisheries and the development of coastal areas and support for young fishermen. That is very important at a time when the harsh face of the crisis is the face of youth unemployment, which is close to 50% in many of the countries that have been hard hit by the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">This legislation clearly gets to the heart of the problem. The real message for the Mediterranean countries that will benefit from this regulation and for the other countries in the European Union is that we must seize the opportunity to apply either the Mediterranean Regulation or other regulations on fisheries, so that we can guarantee that there will be fish, so that we can guarantee that fisheries resources will be protected, so that there will be fish in the sea and the jobs we so sorely need.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Europe’s fisheries sector is going through a tough time at the moment, and if we also refer to the fishing sector in countries with economic austerity programmes, then the situation is even more dramatic. For that reason, I would like to congratulate the Commission because through the increase in cofinance for the European Fisheries Fund programmes, we are helping different countries, such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal, to have more liquidity and to continue to run the cohesion programmes that will aid their economic recovery through job creation and the growth stimulation.</p>
      <p sl="es">The retroactive nature of the measures, from 1 January 2012, will help with that, and we hope that its application through to 31 December 2013 will be enough, because that will mean Europe is emerging from this depression.</p>
      <p sl="es">I think that with this decision, the European institutions will be demonstrating that they are up to the task. I hope, therefore, as the rapporteur stated, that this will be approved at first reading.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, there is really not much argument on the topic of this discussion tonight in plenary; those countries that are eligible to increase cofinancing of the EFF have indeed severe budget constraints today, and we support this step to make it easier for them to implement their fisheries programmes and invest in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think that in this context, it is important – especially for those countries that have declining areas which are very dependent on fisheries – to take the opportunity offered by this amended regulation also to review and update operational programmes and adapt in order to become competitive in the future. In our opinion, the proposal for a new European maritime and fisheries fund that will replace the current European Fisheries’ Fund shows the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is only one way for Member States aiming to mitigate and reduce the risk of future crises in the fisheries sector, and that is to rebuild stocks. No young person in the European Union today wants to invest their future in a business that is not sustainable but is dependent on subsidies; if there were, consumers would not accept it. Fisheries have to be ecologically sustainable in order to be economically and socially sustainable in the long term. With no fish, there can be no fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="en">The future EMFF must be designed and implemented in order to support the objectives of the CFP, especially the sustainable exploitation of marine resources. In these times of budget restraints, it is even more important that the entire European Maritime and Fisheries Fund be geared for supporting sustainability. Public aid should be restricted to investments that are in the public interest.</p>
      <p sl="en">Considerable amounts of money from the Structural Funds used to be awarded to building new vessels and modernising existing ones. In the new EMFF, the Commission is proposing some significant changes, including the suggestion to terminate public aid for scrapping, which is still available under the current programme.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Court of Auditors has criticised the scrapping aid for not having contributed to the reduction of fleet capacity. Indeed, if a ship owner knows that a handsome subsidy for leaving the fleet in the future will always be available, there is good reason to stay on and hope that the situation improves. Such aid is not consistent with the promotion of sustainable fishing.</p>
      <p sl="en">Aid for the modernisation of fishing vessels is rarely in the public interest either, and while the idea of paying a ship owner to install a more energy-efficient engine which emits less CO2 may be seductive, it is, in reality, impossible to ensure that the fishing capacity and effort are not increased when an engine becomes more energy efficient. Significant changes to the EU fishing fleets will be needed. If they are to be achieved, public aid could help in different ways. It must, however, be limited to measures which reduce the environmental impact of the fishing operations by such means as the conversion of vessels and gear to methods which are more selective or inflict less damage to the sea floor.</p>
      <p sl="en">Social support measures during the restructuring of the EU fleet will also be critical. So far, such social support has been directed too much towards ship owners and too little towards the crew, and this imbalance must be redressed through measures such as retraining. Only in this way will the fishing sector be sustainable in the future.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Ferreira on his excellent work. In view of the financial situation the EU Member States find themselves in, this report is of fundamental significance for the fisheries sector. We should take this opportunity to pay particular attention to the situation of small-scale fisheries, which are most exposed to the effects of the current economic situation in Europe. The common fisheries policy currently being discussed in the Committee on Fisheries devotes a separate chapter to this area of fisheries. This is extremely important not only economically, but also culturally. Tradition, the continued existence of an occupation, the ability to pass on experience, and, most importantly, responsibility, has always been associated with this form of fishery. We should ensure that this occupation can continue to survive and create conditions encouraging the younger generations to practise this occupation, so that this generational tradition does not disappear.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The European Fisheries Fund must therefore act as a form of assistance, to support the development of the industry, and not as an instrument encouraging fishermen to give up their jobs. Member States must, with the support of the European Commission, and in the framework of the European Fisheries Fund, pursue a balanced policy not only in the context of the natural environment, but also in the context of the fishing environment. I congratulate the rapporteur, and I would like to say that we will support the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, better late than never. At last, there is a proposal to reduce the level of cofinancing required of the Member States in order for them to benefit from the European Fisheries Fund.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This principle of European Union/Member State cofinancing is a bad principle because it restricts the weakest countries, those which are feeling the full force of the austerity plans that the Union imposes on them, which boils down to nothing more than lending only to the rich.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a disgrace to see the European Funds not being released because the Member States concerned find it too difficult to provide the share of the financing required to unblock these funds. It is also scandalous to see that the biggest share of the fund is allocated to financing the scrapping of fishing vessels, rather than to helping the activity and to jobs in the fisheries sector.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It has to be admitted that this proposal is late in arriving as traditional fishing in the Union is dying, which, in fact, resolves nothing in relation to the necessary conservation of fisheries resources, which are threatened by the factory ships sailing under Japanese or Russian flags. It is the small-scale fishermen who are paying the price whilst the representatives of those who exploit the seas are quietly lobbying in the corridors of Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why, if we wish to maintain a fishing industry that sails under the flags of the Member States of the Union, the European Fisheries Fund must be urgently re-directed towards production and jobs, towards sustainable fishing, towards safety and towards research into more fuel-efficient engines. Above all, Europe needs a truly global fisheries policy for the 21st century that finally turns its back on the liberal dogma of regulation through the market.</p>

      <p sl="el">Speedier financing and the financing facilities offered by the European Fisheries Fund will definitely help in implementing the objectives of the common fisheries policy. This proposal is very important because it has come along at a very important time. We shall soon be required to vote on the Union’s new common fisheries policy, which will set out fisheries policy for the next ten years.</p>
      <p sl="el">Providing adequate resources and eliminating malfunctions in terms of their take-up are vital if we are to achieve the desired results and safeguard levels and the sustainable exploitation of maritime resources.</p>
      <p sl="el">As we have heard, the take-up of resources from the Fisheries Fund is very low. I must emphasise that, in Greece in particular, small-scale and coastal fishermen make their living from fishing, meaning that it is very important that we increase resources and facilitate the allocation of resources to fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="el">At the same time, alongside a smaller national contribution to available resources, please recommend an increase in these resources in the new budget, Commissioner, because fishermen have been hard hit, as we all know.</p>
      <p sl="el">This report acknowledges the pressure being exerted and how the continuing credit and economic crisis is affecting the income of fishermen and fisheries policy in general. The economic and credit crisis in the Union is, of course, expressed differently in the different Member States, but the whole of Europe is affected. We therefore need to find ways to speed up payment of funds. Please make an effort along these lines and channel money where it is needed without obstacles, in order to generate economic growth and new jobs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Fisheries Fund exists to support fishing and coastal communities. It is important that the fund be allowed to contribute to the difficult economic conditions that many countries and communities find themselves in. However, I want simply to draw your attention tonight to my constituency of Northern Ireland. It is the only part of the United Kingdom to share a land border with another country that finds itself in a financial programme because of ongoing economic difficulties. You will then understand that many of the fishermen that I represent look at the disparity in the way some of these proposals will treat them as opposed to their colleagues, who are simply 100 miles down the road. Yet both these fleets suffer from exactly the same problems, and the coastal communities suffer in exactly the same ways: declining fleets and coastal communities that are experiencing ever greater unemployment and economic difficulty.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the death blow for many of the fishermen that I represent in Northern Ireland was the results of the December Council meeting, which almost certainly will see the end of the white fish fleet in Northern Ireland. You can understand how frustrated and concerned the fishermen that I represent are by the perception of disparity that they find. Frustratingly as well, they find problems not only with cofinancing and the rates at which they are allowed to cofinance, but also with the administrative burden that the European Fisheries Fund has laid upon them. The fund has been very difficult and burdensome, both for the administrator and for the applicant, and I would like to see some progress made on this front, both for the immediate future and for the longer-term, post-2014 situation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Spanish socialist delegation, we can only congratulate ourselves for the initiative and support it, because we totally agree that it is necessary for those countries that are suffering a great deal more with the economic and financial crisis, and the austerity policy that is being implemented and pushed through by the Council of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">We believe that through increasing the allocation from the fund, it is possible to help these countries, so that they can not only implement the European cohesion policies, but also sustainable development of fishing and job creation in their countries. This is particularly possible as we believe that the level of adoption of the programme, which is to conclude in 2013, is 28%, that is, a figure that really shows that we are experiencing a crisis that stops those countries and us, the Spanish, from addressing the approved policies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, following the savage report from the Court of Auditors, there is a need for a radical overhaul of the way in which we allocate funds in the fisheries sector. Mr Ferreira’s report seeks to overcome problems with the implementation of the current EFF due to spending constraints caused by the economic crisis. But we need to take on board the key criticisms of the Auditors before we set about creating the framework for the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">Their main complaint was centred on the overcapacity of the EU fleet. They stated that, although the alignment of fishing capacity to fishing opportunities is one of the cornerstones of the CFP and the EFF, fishing overcapacity has never been defined or quantified. The Commissioner said in a recent speech that building up healthy fish stocks in our waters is the best way to increase fishermen’s incomes. But we cannot hope to build up fish stocks unless we tackle the overcapacity of the EU fleet.</p>
      <p sl="en">We cannot tackle overcapacity if we use taxpayers’ money to subsidise the construction of new fishing vessels or the modernisation of existing vessels or indeed, as Isabella Lövin said, the upgrading of engines, supposedly to make them more fuel efficient and to cut CO2 emissions, but probably to make them more effective at catching fish. So let us take close cognisance of what the Auditors said, make sure the EMFF is used for the best effect in future: for funding selective gear for safety on board vessels, marketing for POs and for boosting EU aquaculture.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the proposal for a resolution does not serve the interests of small-scale and poor fishermen; on the contrary, it will speed up their demise. The common fisheries policy, the instrument of which is the European Fisheries Fund, is resulting in the disappearance of small-scale coastal fishermen by financing the destruction of small fishing craft, with painful economic and social consequences for workers and inhabitants of continental and island areas.</p>
      <p sl="el">The concentration and profitability of large corporate groups active in fisheries and aquaculture and in processing and selling fish products is being reinforced. There is no sign of a reversal in, or an end to, chaotic overfishing and environmental destruction, even in Natura 2000 protected areas. All of this is rubberstamped by the governments of the EU Member States because the criterion of the common fisheries policy is to increase the profits of the European monopolies.</p>
      <p sl="el">The reduction in the Member States’ contribution to the European Fisheries Fund is very unlikely to turn out for the best for small-scale fishermen because total funding from the European Union will remain the same, which will translate into a reduction in planned projects and actions and even more selective financing of them.</p>
      <p sl="el">The only eligible projects will be those that come within the strategic objectives of the common fisheries policy and capitalist restructurings under the EU 2020 strategy and bolster the competitiveness and profitability of the European monopolies active in the fisheries sector, thereby speeding up the demise and destruction of poor, small-scale fishermen, especially small-scale coastal fishermen.</p>
      <p sl="el">This is the capitalist growth planned by the European Union, the governments of the Member States and the plutocracy for the common fisheries policy. It will bring about poverty, impoverishment and the persecution of small-scale fishermen and an increase in profits for the European monopolies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the EFF has EUR 4.5 billion to spend on fishing over the period 2007 to 2013 covering scrapping of fishing vessels, aquaculture, inland fishing, sustainability and administration of the fund. But fishing managed very well before the CFP was introduced, livings were made, fish was plentiful. Since its inception in 1973, the CFP has introduced rules and regulations to control fishing. Now the EFF – why? After all, fishermen have been plying their trade for centuries without all this, and a viable industry has been passed down the generations. Fishermen are not stupid. They have looked after their stocks, just as a farmer looks after his livestock and land.</p>
      <p sl="en">This proposal, of course, is a backdoor way of giving extra financial support to countries which have been bailed out, bailout funds under the EFSM will trigger this extra support from the EFF, and yet more taxpayers’ money goes down the drain. So this whole scheme, purporting to help fishing with more funds, is really an addition to bailouts, which are supposed to be loans by way of bond issues with time limits for repayment. Does that mean that the extra EFF money will not be included in bailout repayments? Does it mean that cash will be available without issuing bonds? If so, EFF funding will be a gift to offset a debt. What kind of finance is that?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have done very well, Commissioner, to promote this initiative and this regulation, but I would like to return to one problem – the only thing I want to pick up on in my speech – which is the under-execution of funds. The Commission must intervene because here we are facing an example of under-execution of funds. You have moved very intelligently to accelerate this process.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr Ferreira makes some excellent points, because there are a number of questions over this issue: I do not think that we can transform the common fisheries policy over these two years, but I think we can direct our resources appropriately, especially to the most vulnerable countries, which are in greatest need of assistance at the moment.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would add, Commissioner, that in order to make this expenditure effective, I would also suggest that the procedures for the execution phase should be simplified; that is something I would focus on. Sometimes, a closer look at the execution of spending and simplified procedures can further assist in this process. I would like to pause for just a second if I may, Mr President, on the Court of Auditors. We must be wary of considering the Court of Auditors’ report as applicable to the whole of Europe. Within the report, there are many different areas where efficiency was different. Thank you and excuse me, Mr President, for running over time.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, as you know full well, I have always taken the view that the common fisheries policy was bad for the fish and bad for the fishermen. You have been the first to recognise that a lot of mistakes have been made in the past, and the trouble is that it is very difficult to overcome some of these mistakes.</p>
      <p sl="en">My constituency, the East of England, used to have a large and vibrant fishing industry. Sadly, this is no longer the case. Earlier today, I was talking to a fisherman in my region who has been involved in fishing for some thirty years and now has one of the last seven boats in what was the great fishing port of Lowestoft. His boat is under 12 metres; in fact, 97% of the UK fishing fleet is in this category, but they have an allocation of only 4% of the total allowable catch.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course these fishermen do not want to see stocks decimated or wasted – they want to make a decent living. To be able to do this, they need flexibility and a better quota. Like most of our citizens, they are outraged by the discard policy. My local fisherman has to throw away more than he is allowed to land. I know you want to put a stop to discards, but we cannot wait until after 2016. There will not be any fishermen left by then.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the lack of cofinancing capacity is certainly, at the moment, one of the biggest obstacles preventing the effective use of European funds, including the European Fisheries Fund. Due to the budgetary constraints it has produced, the financial crisis has made the situation even more difficult for European countries whose level of development is below the general average for the European Union. This is why the proposals from the Commission on all the categories of funds are good news for the Member States involved.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I should point out that there is yet another problem which remains unresolved. I am referring to the lack of resources for the private cofinancing of investments. This situation applies to all categories of European funds, especially to those intended for small enterprises and agriculture. In this regard, we need credit and public guarantee facilities to support potential beneficiaries. It is also vital to make the procedures simpler.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we welcome the increase in the interim payments by 10 percentage points above the current cofinancing rate for each priority axis. Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, thereby extending the scope of the common fisheries policy to the Black Sea. These countries have accepted and fulfilled all the requirements for joining the common fisheries policy and are now eligible for support from the European Fisheries Fund.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There is no global agreement on the regional management of the Black Sea fish stocks, apart from bilateral agreements. The Commission’s support is needed to develop regional dialogue aimed at devising a common marine strategy in the Black Sea region, also involving the other states bordering the Black Sea. I think that setting up a Black Sea consultative forum is appropriate, which will provide a technical platform for communication and cooperation for the operators in the fisheries sector. If a basic sharing agreement continues to remain in abeyance, there is a risk of the resources collapsing, and the economic damage already caused to certain fisheries resources will become widespread.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I wish to repeat what I said earlier, that what the Commission is trying to do with this proposal is to deal with an emergency. This is an emergency measure. We are trying to help the Member States in real trouble due to the economic crisis, so that they can reduce the national contribution rate for Fisheries Fund programmes. This will ease the pressure on them.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, it will take more than this to resolve the problem, because the take-up of European Union funds is not just a question of the national contribution. We also need suitable programmes financed in accordance with the regulation. Nonetheless, it will bring some relief and that is what we are trying to do at this very difficult juncture for certain Member States.</p>
      <p sl="el">A number of general comments were made in the debate about the Fisheries Fund, especially about the future composition of the Fisheries Fund, based on the proposal we have made to reform fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="el">I agree with many of the comments. The programmes need to be simplified because we have a very low take-up rate. We need to focus on actions that support sustainability, because there is no point in handing out European taxpayers’ money to finance a policy that does not result in healthy fish reserves. The only way to increase fishermen’s income is to have healthy fish reserves.</p>
      <p sl="el">I agree that we need to support coastal fisheries and small-scale fishermen in particular. That is why the proposal for the new fund will include increased financing for all small vessel owners of up to 75% for every country.</p>
      <p sl="el">Naturally, there are problems for which the national governments, not the Commission, are to blame. I wish to clarify that, because it is all too easy to say that the Commission is to blame, for example, because small-scale fishermen are disappearing and because they only receive 4% of the quotas in national allocations. We allocate the quotas by Member State and the internal allocation is then based on decisions taken by national governments.</p>
      <p sl="el">I therefore think that all this needs to be borne in mind when the House debates the new financial regulation for the next period.</p>
      <p sl="el">Today, we are talking about an emergency measure which, it should be noted, will not increase financing by the Member States; it will simply speed up financing. We are not therefore giving additional resources to the Member States and certain members need not worry on that count. What we are doing is to help to expedite financing, in order to help them in these difficult times.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, a few very short comments in the short time still remaining to me. Naturally, I should like to express my thanks for the comments and observations regarding the report. First of all, I should like to say – and you have just confirmed this, Commissioner – that this is not a demonstration or show of solidarity. This is a show of flexibility that is late arriving, unfortunately: this proposal lacks such solidarity, which would only be the case if the funding available to these Member States were increased, which is not happening. However, it was important that the Commission consider this possibility.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Moreover, this proposal – and I would highlight it again – does not guarantee full use of the funds available. The amounts of national funding required are still 15% or 40%, depending on whether the region is eligible for convergence funding or not. However, in addition to the problem of under-execution of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), to which a number of speeches referred, we are facing another problem. As well as measures to increase the take-up of funds, we need to reorient the priorities of the EFF itself. This was mentioned in a number of speeches and we entirely agree. There is a need to focus on and not forget that more than 50% of the EFF has been used to scrap boats, when what we need is to steer it towards productive activity, towards the renewal and modernisation of the fleet and support infrastructure, and towards using job creation and vocational training to bring young people back into the sector. There needs to be positive discrimination favouring coastal and artisanal fishing, so we have a certain amount of concern about the limitations placed on some of these areas by the future European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which needed to stimulate such productive activities.</p>
      <p sl="pt">One final word in conclusion, Mr President, regarding the amendments made by the Council and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats): we consider these amendments unnecessary and inopportune. However, we believe that, given the urgent need to adopt this proposal, we should not oppose these amendments because what is needed, in fact, is for it to be adopted as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on this report tomorrow will bring to an end a trade dispute that has lasted for 14 years. It dates back to an arbitration award by the World Trade Organisation in 1999 which went against the European Union. Since then, we have been forced, so to speak, to import hormone-treated meat from the US and sanctions have been imposed by both sides. I do not want to talk about the past, but I do want to express my pleasure about the fact that we have succeeded in putting an end to all of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Danish Presidency has already endorsed my report on behalf of the Council in an informal trialogue. As a result, there are no more obstacles in the way of our vote tomorrow, which will conclude this dispute. Against this background, I would like to ask you all to support my report. It is true that it represents a compromise. However, in my view, the compromise is very balanced. The European agricultural industry in particular will now have the security to plan ahead, which has not necessarily been the case in the past.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, this report is also an important indication of an improvement in transatlantic relations. We must put aside many of our differences of opinion. This is the only way we will be able to establish joint international standards. We should not be under any illusions. Only the US and the EU together will be able to hold their own in tomorrow’s globalised world. Therefore, I also welcome the fact, for example, that we have now set up a high-level working group on jobs and growth in which we can work together to establish the necessary conditions for growth.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to look at one more point and this is an issue which concerns the future. Since the cases of BSE in the EU, the US has had in place an import ban on beef from the EU. However, there is no legitimate scientific reason for this any more, as there have been no BSE cases here for several years. The fact that the US has not yet lifted the import ban is purely due to protectionism.</p>
      <p sl="de">This is unacceptable. Therefore, as part of this legislative procedure, I have written to all those involved and held a number of meetings. In particular, I have asked the US Secretary of Agriculture, Mr Vilsack, and the US Trade Representative, Mr Kirk, to complete the process of lifting the import ban as quickly as possible. Now I have some very good news for you, which I am particularly pleased about. On Friday, 9 March, the Department of Agriculture in Washington published the draft rule that forms part of the mandatory consultation procedure. This is the first step towards taking the important measures to lift the import ban.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to ask the United States not to jeopardise the cooperative atmosphere in this area and to complete this process as soon as possible. I would now like to extend my wholehearted thanks to the Commission and to the Council Presidency for their cooperation, but, most of all, to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I know that for my fellow Members on the committee, some of the steps in this process have been very difficult, but you have been more than cooperative. I would like to thank you very much for this.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, first of all, I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl, and all of the members of the Parliamentary Committee on International Trade for their work and their commitment to achieving this agreement at first reading, as Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl mentioned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The proposal to increase the tariff-rate quota for ‘hormone-free beef’ is included in the Memoranda of Understanding signed with the United States in 2009 and with Canada in 2011. By creating reciprocal opportunities in the market on both sides of the Atlantic, these memoranda are a crucial step in bringing an end to a dispute that has lasted for a decade. The United States has got rid of the sanctions affecting some European Union products, whilst the European Union has offered significant access to its market for hormone-free beef.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am pleased to note that Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and the Committee on International Trade fully support this agreement. Phase II of the memoranda are scheduled to come into force on 1 August 2012. I hope that this will lead to the dispute over hormone-treated beef being resolved once and for all at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am very aware of the fact that exports of European veal and beef to the United States are still blocked due to US restrictions related to BSE, as Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl mentioned. As you know, these restrictions are not in line with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) rules, which specify that trade in beef must be authorised between countries in the same risk category, as is the case here. The European Union and the United States are in the same World Organisation for Animal Health risk category, in other words, the controlled risk category.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I have met Mr Vilsack and we had the opportunity to speak about these matters. Very recently, in Nuremberg in February, I met Mr Vilsack’s assistant at the US Department of Agriculture, to announce the mutual recognition of the rules on organic agriculture. On that occasion, I once again asked the US administration to do everything it can to make progress on the BSE issue as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As has been mentioned today, we see that draft standards on this issue were published by the Federal Register on 9 March. This publication marks the start of a consultation period with the interested parties and, therefore, also opens the way to clarify this issue which should also be, as I have said, in accordance with international rules and standards.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I hope that we will manage to conclude this issue quickly and ensure that beef producers on both sides of the Atlantic can enjoy specific access to the market.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I once again thank the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament as a whole for having very quickly and effectively supported this draft regulation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, as my colleague, the rapporteur from the Committee on International Trade, and the Commissioner pointed out, it is 14 years that the trade war between the US and the EU over the ban on hormone-treated beef imports to the EU has raged, both in the WTO where we lost twice, and in the form of tit-for-tat sanctions from the US against EU exports into the US market, causing real damage to both the EU and the US I would argue. This deal negotiated by Baroness Ashton in 2009 will, at long last, draw a line under this issue once and for all. Let us be clear: it is a win-win for both sides. In the EU, we get to keep our ban on hormone-treated imports of beef and we also lose the US trade sanctions that have been put upon many of our exports. In return, the US gets 45 000 tonnes of access to the EU market for high-quality beef cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an important step forward in normalising our trade relations with the US and it is already beginning to pay dividends. As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, on Friday, the US announced new BSE rules for beef imports. I would hope that all colleagues in the Chamber here tonight would urge the US Government to adopt these new rules as swiftly as possible and build on and reinforce the trust between both the EU and the US on trade issues. This can only bring benefits to both consumers and producers in the United States and in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my very special thanks go to the rapporteur, Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for her hard work. I believe that the result of the vote in the committee shows that she has succeeded in reaching a good compromise in her report on this sensitive subject. She has my warm congratulations.</p>
      <p sl="de">By bringing an end to this dispute, both the European Union and the United States have taken a major and important step forward. The agreement on introducing tariff quotas on high-quality, hormone-free beef represents the end of a trade dispute that has had a negative impact on many areas of foreign trade and caused great damage. After several rulings by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and restrictions and trade barriers imposed by both sides, which affected not only the agriculture industry, but also many product areas within the EU, we now have a situation which is safe for European consumers and exporters. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has spoken out clearly in favour of the report in its statement. European citizens do not want hormone-treated meat and European exporters do not want trade barriers.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, this report is a clear win-win situation for all of us. However, we now need to take an assertive approach to resolving the outstanding problems. The ban on imports of European beef into the US is totally unacceptable. It is essential for us to work constructively on this. I would like to make it clear how important it is to put an end to trade disputes, in particular, between the EU and the US, and to devote our energies to other tasks.</p>
      <p sl="de">The European Union is faced with major challenges and must focus on competitiveness, innovation and growth. Trade disputes do not help us in these areas. Unfortunately, disputes of this kind often leave third countries in a better starting position in relation to the European Union. It is important for us to be aware of this fact.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vote on opening up the tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef marks an important moment in good transatlantic relations. What is more, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is, for the first time, playing a fundamental role in approving this sort of decision. This fact increases the United States’ interest in and understanding of Parliament, as we saw first-hand during the meetings held with the US Congress by a delegation from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) last June.</p>
      <p sl="it">This agreement puts an end to a long-held, age-old dispute, thereby enabling the sanctions imposed by the US to be lifted, while also maintaining the ban on imports of meat treated with hormones so as to guarantee our own high standards on food quality and safety.</p>
      <p sl="it">For these reasons, the AGRI Committee – which I am honoured to chair – gave staunch support for the conclusion of this agreement and did not present any amendments, in the spirit of deepening transatlantic trade relations and improving dispute resolution within the framework of the World Trade Organisation. My heartfelt thanks to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and to the rapporteur for our committee, Mr Lyon.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we welcome the conclusion to these trade wars over beef and think it should be a moment for reflection. With the rise and growth of the economic power of the BRIC countries, the US and the EU share a huge interest in ensuring that the WTO rules are respected. Long-lasting conflicts such as this one, which has lasted for almost 15 years, do huge damage to effective multilateralism. This report should be used as a stepping stone for broader EU-US trade relations.</p>
      <p sl="de">We ask our American counterparts to respond in good faith and remove the BSE ban on EU beef. In both the EU and the US, we can benefit from keeping the global perspective in mind. Doing so should push us closer to breaking down trade barriers and moving towards a more integrated trans-Atlantic market space to drive jobs and growth and to launch the free trade negotiations at the next EU-US Summit. Our cooperation should be based on mutual trust, reciprocity and complementarity. In line with this sense of urgency, I believe we should all – Parliament, the Commission and the External Action Service – work to encourage the US to stop any disproportionate protectionist measures.</p>
      <p sl="de">The remarks by President Sarkozy, who wants to match the ‘Buy American’ clauses with ‘Buy European’ measures, shows what kind of downward spiral this can lead to, and it would be undesirable. Our perspective should not be focused inward; we should be on the ball and aware of global competition: the competition for trade, talent and, eventually, values. So we should work together with an open mind.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my constituency – Northern Ireland – has an export-oriented agriculture sector. We export about 70% of everything that we produce, and this is particularly true in the beef sector. My government will, therefore, always be looking for new markets and the opening-up of markets for the beef sector from Northern Ireland. We view this development as a step in the right direction. It rectifies the unjust stance taken by the US in relation to agricultural produce from the EU, and I hope that it can be viewed as recognition of the high-quality, safe and wholesome food that is produced by European farmers and which is so eminently traceable.</p>
      <p sl="en">Like others in this Chamber tonight, I would look for an early resolution to the import ban and hope for the early adoption of the new BSE rules by the US. I would also hope that this kind of development will lead to the opening up of further markets for EU agricultural produce, and particularly beef. However, I want to finish tonight with a word of warning, one that is very clear from the beef sector in Northern Ireland. It is that the new proposals for the common agricultural policy have at their heart a disadvantage to the beef sector in Northern Ireland, which tends to be more intensive and is characterised by small family farms, and we fear that the new CAP will only advantage landlords.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, it is a major agreement that has been reached today with the amendment of the regulation authorising an autonomous tariff quota for imports of high-quality beef, albeit in very limited quantities. We are living through the aftermath of a long-standing trade conflict between Europe, on the one hand, and the United States and Canada, on the other. Like those who have already spoken, let us indeed thank the rapporteurs and, in particular, my colleague, Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for their work. Let us also, however, add our voice to theirs in the call for support for the implementation of the second phase of the agreement. This victory has been won by European diplomacy; it is the victory of the respect that we owe to Europe’s citizens, as hormone-treated beef is banned once and for all from our stores.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The sanctions that our transatlantic partners imposed on us to try to make us change our minds did not shake our conviction of the need to find an agreement. Still, the system for restricting entry to their market especially penalised a large number of European food products as import duties, let us remember, could run as high as 300%, which, in fact, pushed them out of these markets. We all remember, in the case of my country, the sorry tale of Roquefort and shallots.</p>
      <p sl="fr">At a time when Europe has to re-establish its trade balance, the end of these sanctions therefore seems like a shot in the arm for European producers. A year has already gone by since the Americans lifted all of the restrictions that they had imposed, eight months prior to the date set out in the agreement. Therefore, we now need to go further. The discussions that we have held have been fruitful. They have shown the extent to which we have been able to work together. Let us then continue to work in the same direction in an informative, demanding and diplomatic manner, but, above all, on the key basis of reciprocity, because reciprocity does not exclude openness. Reciprocity guarantees a win-win situation, mutual respect and joint success.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, this is the first time that Parliament has worked on a matter of this kind under the same conditions as the Council, in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, to agree to the amendment of a regulation that is, as the rapporteur has said, a well-planned undertaking.</p>
      <p sl="es">This regulation enables us to resolve a conflict which has been ongoing for many years, as previous speakers have pointed out. The European Union banned imports of hormone-treated meat. The United States and Canada’s response to the European Union was an increase in tariffs on certain products they considered sensitive. This meant products like chocolate, bread, pork products and fruit juices, with the effects felt over a wide area, particularly in my country, in the Levante region.</p>
      <p sl="es">This agreement is, firstly, good news for European consumers. The European Union was successful in retaining its ban on imports of hormone-treated beef and, in exchange, has agreed an additional quota for imports of high-quality beef.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, it is beneficial for European producers who were disadvantaged by the tariff increase, which represented an additional burden of EUR 190 million for the European Union: EUR 6 million for my country alone.</p>
      <p sl="es">Also, it thereby increases market quotas for these products in the United States and Canada, whose exports have fallen by 90% over the last ten years. We should therefore also congratulate the European Commission on these negotiations, which prevented the United States from applying ‘carousel’ sanctions in 2009 to increase the number of products subjected to higher tariffs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, we support the commitment that the European Union has obtained, which ensures protection for European consumers and enables us to normalise trade relations with the United States and Canada.</p>
      <p sl="es">Negotiations of this kind are a good example of how conflicts may be resolved. We have been talking about beef imports from the United States. There has not been an outbreak of spongiform encephalitis for some time and we are now free of risk. Therefore, we should ensure that we resolve long-standing and hitherto insuperable problems through this type of agreement.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, my thanks to the rapporteur and other colleagues who worked on this dossier. It seems that everyone is in very good humour this evening because we have solved, we hope, a trade war that has lasted for far too long: 15 years. So we can be grateful that we are at this stage and that it augurs well for the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Indeed, I too welcome, as the Commissioner did, the publication of the draft rule by the US authorities on Friday. I think it is an act of good faith and we hope that it follows through with the reopening of the market for EU beef to the USA. But there is one issue which I think has not been resolved and has not been mentioned here, so there is still some caution on this.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we have made the agreement but we have to do the detail. It is my understanding from the US side that the regulations on the use of lactic acid treatment for the carcases is not to their liking, is not at all practical. I suppose, from the EU perspective, it is not good to hear this, but this is what they are saying to us and therefore they will need more clarity on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Equally, I would be somewhat concerned that without that clarity, we will not see the movement on EU beef exports to the USA. So yes, we have achieved a great deal and we have broken the deadlock on a trade war, but I think we need to do a great deal more for both sides to benefit from this solution.</p>
      <p sl="en">My last point, and I will repeat it, is on the issue of practical regulations. I know in this House we have concerns sometimes around how detailed and complex and bureaucratic our regulations are. It would be unfortunate if the US is saying to us, and it is from what I hear, that our regulations on this issue are far too impractical. So perhaps the Commissioner would refer to that and perhaps also to concerns around Russia and their proposal to ban livestock exports because of the Schmallenberg virus?</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, it is recommended that we should not eat too much red meat. According to some studies, it increases the risk of cancer and heart conditions. However, I welcome the compromise which has been reached as part of the WTO arbitration on the ‘beef hormone dispute’ between the US and EU. The EU will be able to obtain compliance with the animal protection rules for beef, the cause of the dispute for the last 13 years, while the US will gradually allow certain categories of European products to be imported, especially traditional ones. The first products entered in the relevant European database also included a product from Romania, Topoloveni jam.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there is a saying that good things come to those who wait. That is not always the case. Sometimes, the situation gets worse the longer you wait. However, here we can work on the assumption that the long negotiations and the long struggle have ultimately paid off. The major conflicts with the United States over our exports and their exports in these areas have lasted for 10 to 15 years and that is a long time. For this reason, I believe that the solution is a good one. We now have fewer problems exporting some products to the US that we previously could not export at all or only with great difficulty. We are importing high-quality beef and the quotas for this have been increased. I do not know whether it is absolutely necessary to bring high-quality beef into Europe, because we have our own, but in negotiations, both parties always have to make concessions. That is what has happened in this case. I believe that the end result will be a good one. Ms McGuinness is right in saying that we must, of course, monitor very closely what happens in the future, but we can ultimately be satisfied with what we have achieved.</p>

    <intervention id="2-681-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, in conclusion, I can but welcome the fact that we have reached this stage. As some of you have mentioned, so that it can be said that both sides are happy, the issue of BSE must also be finalised on the US side.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What happened on 9 March was a step in the right direction. Ms McGuinness mentioned the question of treatment with lactic acid. The European Commission has said several times – in fact, at every opportunity when dealing with the United States – that this issue of lactic acid has to be dealt with scientifically, rather than as a bargaining chip.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the same way that we are also asking for the issue of BSE to be treated in a scientific manner. When there is scientific proof that we have this disease under control, this measure should not be used as a non-tariff barrier. As regards lactic acid, this is the method that the European Commission has chosen to handle this issue. The EFSA has carried out scientific studies on the treatment of carcasses with lactic acid. The European Commission will come to a position on the basis of the scientific analysis and I hope that this issue is not going to hold up the United States’ decision on BSE.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the most practical regulation for the quota system, some might find it is not perfect but, unfortunately, we do not have a perfect system. We are actually in the process of analysing, in the wake of complaints from various importers, how these systems can be improved for greater transparency and predictability. Here too, however, we are restricted by the methods with which we are familiar.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Ms Băsescu, as regards the geographical indication quality system, we are still in negotiations with the United States to reach a mutual recognition of geographical indication quality systems, other than for alcoholic beverages and wine, for which we have the elements of a specific agreement. However, we are also hoping to achieve recognition for this geographical indication system at the World Trade Organisation. Moreover, with some countries, some large countries like China, for example, but also with others, we always deal with the issue of recognition of geographical indication systems in bilateral agreements. We are also hoping to make progress with the United States on this issue.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A good sign that things are moving forward is the recently concluded agreement on the mutual recognition of our certification systems for organic products. European products can now be exported to the US market with a European organic certification, and this is also the case for US products on the European market. This shows that negotiations and agricultural and food industry diplomacy can also produce good results.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My thanks once again to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl for the reports and thanks also to the European Parliament for showing once again that the codecision system not only gives legitimacy to the decisions taken at European level, but it also allows it to be done quickly and effectively.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, your last remark was the best. It is true that, in this very case, the codecision that we have had since the Treaty of Lisbon has shown its worth.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report not only concerns high-quality beef, but is also a clear indication that many of the relationships between the US and the EU, which have recently become rather bogged down and have not looked very optimistic, could begin to improve. In that respect, the whole situation is positive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the report looks to the future. As you have all said, there remains a lot to do and the previous speaker, Ms McGuinness, is right in saying that we must, of course, pay attention to the details. This is only the beginning of improved transatlantic trade relationships.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to make one last point and I believe, on the basis of many years’ experience of Parliament, that it should not be taken for granted. The Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have come to the same conclusion in the case of a sensitive product. This is not something completely new, but it certainly does not happen every day. That is why I am so pleased. I would like to thank everyone once again.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I welcome the fact that a Memorandum of Understanding has been reached between the EU and US, as well as between the EU and Canada. I think that the prompt conclusion of these documents is in the interest of European producers. The EU and US economies account for roughly half of global GDP. The transatlantic partnership is crucial for the economy, trade and European jobs, and trade disputes make cooperation difficult between both trade partners. At the same time, the resolution of the European Parliament of 8 March 2011 must be respected, which called for an end to the sanctions imposed by the US and Canada on products originating from the EU and the provision of clear guarantees regarding beef imports which need to come into line with the food safety requirements stipulated by European legislation. In this respect, I welcome the proposal that the European executive can suspend the EU’s annual tariff quota if the agreement is not implemented or maintained by the US and Canada.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The problem of trade restrictions between the European Union and the United States on imports of beef has been going on since 1988. After many years of negotiation, mutual export restrictions, sanctions and retaliatory customs duties, there is a chance that this dispute might finally end, and that it might end to the benefit of both parties. The United States and Canada have suspended all sanctions imposed on agricultural products from the EU in return for zero duty on an increased tariff quota of high-quality beef containing no growth hormone (which was the reason for the ban on imports into the EU). It only remains for us to meet the agreed deadlines, in other words, to approve the second stage of the agreement, so that it can enter into force on 1 August of this year. I fully support the rapporteur’s position and advocate a favourable opinion of the European Parliament on this issue. The agreement will have a very favourable effect on transatlantic economic and political relations with our major trading partners.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this report, which is known as ‘Omnibus I’, involves adapting the entire body of EU commercial law and all our procedures to the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon and, in particular, Articles 290 and 291 thereof. The Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Parliament the right to a say in trade issues, which no other parliament in the European Union has in the same form. We have taken the US Congress as our model, rather than the national parliaments.</p>
      <p sl="de">Until now, European commercial policy has essentially been excluded from the current comitology procedure. Instead, the decisions were ultimately made by the Council. Now this special regime has come to an end and the executive decisions concerning trade policy will be made by the Commission, as in other areas of policy in the European Union. However, the Commission cannot do this in a vacuum.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to outline briefly the most important changes proposed in my draft report. Firstly, there is the issue of taking account of the common understanding. The European Parliament has reached a common understanding with the Commission and the Council which makes the use of delegated acts and of implementing provisions subject to a uniform model. To my great surprise, the Commission has not taken this into account in its proposal. Therefore, my report deals with this and is based on the terms of the common understanding.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the report endorses the introduction of delegated acts in all of the areas proposed by the Commission. Thirdly, we come to the question of examination procedures or advisory procedures. The report confirms the Commission proposal to use the examination procedure when applying implementing provisions in the vast majority of cases. However, there are sometimes cases in which the examination procedure would be too time consuming. Here, we need another procedure and we recommend the advisory procedure.</p>
      <p sl="de">Fourthly, there is the consultation procedure. We endorse the Commission’s proposal to replace consultations, which are no longer necessary when procedures are initiated as part of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, with a requirement for the Commission to inform the Member States. We do not want to extend the time limits in the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulation to the maximum permitted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Industry and trading partners need certainty in order to be able to plan ahead. This will only be the case if the time limits are shorter, which also makes the measures more effective. Therefore, the draft report proposes that the time limits are shortened, but it always allows for exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, the report recommends requiring the Commission to report to the European Parliament and to the public with regard to most of the regulations in question. The importance of this is demonstrated by the current discussion on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) procedure, which was not entirely transparent. We live in the age of the Internet and, therefore, we can never do enough to provide information to the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">My report reflects the changes brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon. It is, in fact, a very technical report and it is very complex with regard to the purely technical issues. At the same time, it is highly political because it represents the start of a new era in the very important field of foreign trade relations. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and Mr De Gucht. Mr Cioloş, please would you pass my thanks on to him.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="2-690-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Dacian Cioloş" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me to mention first of all that Commissioner De Gucht had already planned an overseas trip today. Due to the late confirmation of this item on the agenda, he was not able to change his itinerary and be here with you today, as he had hoped. That is why he asked me to speak about this file on behalf of the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission is much obliged to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and to the shadow rapporteur, Mr Moreira, as well as the other members of the Committee on International Trade, for their constructive approach with regard to this proposal. This is an important proposal as it represents the first and most significant step towards aligning existing legislation on the matter of common commercial policy with the new arrangements relating to implementing acts and delegated acts. The Commission is committed to working with Parliament and the Council to conclude this legislative issue as quickly as possible. A very high number of amendments will be voted on this week. Clearly, I cannot comment on each and every one of them. Detailed work must take place within the three institutions in order to deal with these amendments. I will limit myself to making some general observations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, in principle, the Commission can accept all amendments which suggest using the advisory procedure for provisional measures. Secondly, the Commission recognises that delegated acts should be inserted into the regulation on provisional safeguard mechanisms for China. Thirdly, the Commission acknowledges those amendments relating to the anti-dumping regulation.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The Commission supports those amendments seeking to address the issue of time limits for the application of new comitology rules to the anti-dumping regulation. However, these amendments pose some practical or legal problems. The Commission expects and hopes to find an effective way of addressing these problems as part of the discussion due to take place between the three institutions at the end of voting in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to finish by expressing the Commission’s appreciation for the work carried out to date. At this stage, all that remains is the prospect of working together to finalise this issue, in due course, with a view to its adoption.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much regret that we are holding the debate on this very important subject so late in the evening in the absence of the public and the Commissioner who is responsible. That is by no means a criticism of the Commissioner, but I genuinely regret that this report, which deals with a number of issues that Parliament has been fighting for over the last few decades, particularly in the area of common foreign trade policy, will not receive the attention it deserves from the public. This report that Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl and several other Members have drawn up over recent weeks and months implements the Treaty of Lisbon in many areas of common foreign trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">As Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl rightly says, the powers which the European Parliament has had since 1 December 2009, and which are also being granted to us by the Omnibus, are not found in any other parliament in the world, with the possible exception of the United States, but other parliaments, such as the parliament in Germany, the country where I come from, have never had powers of the kind that the European Parliament has in the area of common foreign and security policy or, above all, in foreign trade policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl for introducing shorter time limits in the area of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy instruments. I believe that this is urgently needed. I am also grateful to Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl for her highly meticulous approach to this subject. I would like the European Parliament to be aware of its responsibility with regard to the common foreign trade policy of the European Union. We are no longer just the people who complain that they are not taken seriously enough, as was the case before 1 December 2009. Instead, we have a specific responsibility and I would like us to do justice to it and to take a serious approach to all the dossiers in our area – the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has already been mentioned – and to evaluate them properly.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, if you will permit me, I have another comment concerning something which is particularly close to my heart. We in the European Parliament should use all the resources and means at our disposal to ensure that Parliament’s administration is in a position to monitor and implement all the comitology procedures in practice, so that we can fulfil our control functions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, not before time, Parliament is bringing the legislation in force on the EU’s external trade policy into line with the new system of delegated acts and implementing acts resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. Let us recall what the treaty says: firstly, that the European Commission can only have legislative powers in the shape of delegated acts, at the decision and under the control of the EU’s two legislators; and, secondly, that the executive power generally falls to the Commission and not to the Council, under the control of the Member States and not the Council itself.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As regards common external trade policy, it is important to stress that this is an exclusive EU policy and competence not controlled by the Member States; a policy that follows the Community method of Commission initiatives approved by the two legislators. That is why we must be especially demanding in the application of the new rules under the Treaty of Lisbon, which means two things: Parliament must retain full control over producing EU legislation, meaning that we must classify as delegated acts all cases in which the Commission is charged with complementing or amending EU legislative acts; secondly, in the case of implementing acts, we cannot allow the Member States to have a power of veto over the executive power of the Commission, precisely because it is an exclusive EU competence. As such, application of the examination procedure, which gives the Member States power of veto over the executive power of the Commission, must be the exception rather than the rule.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Please permit me to conclude by congratulating the rapporteur, Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on the excellent work she has done and on the spirit of compromise that she has achieved in this report.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, every aspect of European trade policy has changed. The policy has a completely new legal basis and it is particularly obvious that the new Treaty has had major consequences for the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="de">The subject we are currently discussing concerns what at first sight are technical questions and these involve complex concepts, such as the introduction of delegated acts and the adoption of implementing provisions. However, behind these concepts lie tangible trade policy interests. We only need to think of the time limits for anti-dumping procedures or for the regulations on anti-subsidy instruments. In these cases, time really is money.</p>
      <p sl="de">The new requirements for transparency in the case of non-confidential information are also of great interest to the general public. Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl has already mentioned the subject of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). If we had had more transparency in this area right from the beginning, who knows how many of the discussions could have been avoided.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think that at this point, I simply need to give my thanks to the rapporteur, who has guided us confidently through this subject and has managed the cooperation with her fellow Members very well. I hope that we will very soon reach a conclusion in this area.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, this report on common commercial policy, better known under the name Omnibus I, is definitely one of the most important reports with regard to the way in which the European Parliament works with European foreign trade policy. We should not be deceived by the technical complexity of this proposal. This is a very significant dossier. It defines how the Committee on International Trade, in the first stage, and the European Parliament, in the second stage, will make use of delegated acts and implementing acts in future. My fellow Members have already mentioned the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) as a current example on several occasions.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to look at three points which, in my view, need to be highlighted because they are of major importance for us. The first is the examination procedures. These are a good thing. However, we must retain the option of putting temporary measures in place. Acute situations need rapid action. The people who are affected in particular expect this of us. The second point is the removal of the consultation procedure. The Treaty of Lisbon has made the consultation procedures invalid. However, close cooperation with the relevant institutions is still necessary and desirable. This will enable any misunderstandings or inconsistencies to be identified at an earlier stage and included in the decisions on commercial policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">The third point concerns the time limits. It is in the interests of everyone involved that the cases are processed rapidly and efficiently. I welcome the fact that the time limits have been reduced. This will result in more security for the trading partners. The report explains that by abolishing the consultation procedure, it is possible to save two months. Therefore, the rapid completion of the examination procedure must be given the highest priority. I welcome this report and would like to thank the rapporteur warmly once again for her successful work on a very challenging subject.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Cioloş, Ms Quisthoudt-Rowohl, I believe we can say that European foreign trade policy has always been one of the major successes of the European Union. Why is this? Because it is under the sole authority of the European Union and this allows a targeted approach to be taken.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a result of the Treaty of Lisbon, for the first time, the European Parliament is playing an equal role in the legislative process. I am assuming that our foreign trade policy may become even more successful because of this.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, the process of incorporating the old procedures into the new system is incredibly complex. I believe that, with the Commission proposal on Omnibus I and Omnibus II and the excellent work done by the rapporteur on these issues, we have succeeded in finding a system in which we have great confidence, which also gives us controls and which enables the Commission to take successful action, so that we hopefully, and I am saying this quite deliberately, do not repeat our experiences with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I support the amendment of the Council’s 26 legislative acts relating to the common trade policy so as to bring them into line with the new system of delegated and implementing acts. I welcome the more efficient way of exercising the Commission’s implementing powers. It will also help increase the effectiveness of the common commercial policy and enable the EU to become more competitive globally.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, I welcome the Commission’s initiative to highlight the changes which have taken place in the wake of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of the legal framework and institutional balance. I support the Commission’s proposal to resort to the examination procedure in most cases involving implementing acts. Safeguard measures have an important role in this proposal and I, too, would like to stress the need for them in this context.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, allow me to make some brief concluding remarks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, as the debate has shown, this is a technically complex issue. However, it affects many important legislative texts on the matter of commercial policy and therefore justifies the time and effort that have been invested in order to conclude this as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Secondly, the Commission welcomes the broad scope of Parliament’s draft amendments and is happy to work on these issues together and discuss them in the trialogue to follow.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Thirdly and finally, the main issue remains knowing how we are to manage trade defence instruments. We should focus on this as we go into the trialogue. On behalf of the Commission, allow me to thank Parliament for its very detailed work on this issue and, at the same time, assure you of Commissioner De Gucht’s commitment to working with Parliament on common commercial policy.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my thanks go to the shadow rapporteur and, Mr Cioloş, to the Commission, which has assured us of its positive cooperation. I will come back to this later. Tomorrow, we will vote on all the amendments and a final vote will also be held. In the case of this very significant dossier, it is important to me to have a decision in plenary about the report because this is a good back-up and will enable me and my fellow Members to go into the trialogue in a strong position. I assume that we will be able to reach a conclusion quickly because we are all flexible and prepared to compromise.

      <p sl="ro">Commercial policy is an important area for the European Union and Member States. This is why any regulation which helps improve its application, whether at a national and European level or with regard to relations with third countries, is beneficial to all the partners involved. This report is based on the changes brought about by the Lisbon Treaty to the legal and institutional framework and allows the relevant changes to be transposed systematically into secondary law in the area of common commercial policy. In my view, the entry into force of its provisions will enable the Commission to exercise its implementing powers more efficiently, thereby resulting in a more effective common commercial policy. Furthermore, both the partners involved and the general public will be able to understand more quickly the applicable procedures within the commercial policy. Indeed, the application of the horizontal regulation will raise the general level of transparency in applying the commercial policy.</p>
