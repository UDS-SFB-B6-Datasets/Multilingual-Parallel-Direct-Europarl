      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, the annual report of the European Central Bank always offers an opportunity for the European Parliament to review monetary policy and to supplement the work carried out by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs through the monetary dialogue conducted four times a year with the President of the European Central Bank. You will all remember that last year we rejected the report, as it did not correspond to the guidelines advocated by this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The year 2005 was an unusual year, in which the Central Bank initiated a movement raising interest rates five times, the first of which was on 1 December. These successive rises took place in an unusual economic context, determined by both the rise in oil prices and a disadvantageous exchange rate for euro zone exports, and in the context of an upturn in economic growth considered by more acute observers as fragile.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In these circumstances, this report specifically invites the Central Bank to analyse carefully the conditions in which it conducts its monetary policy. I am pleased that this report also emphasises that euro-dollar parity is important to growth in the European Union and that it draws from this a number of conclusions, which have been drafted in a spirit of compromise, bearing in mind the need for each monetary authority to exercise in full its responsibilities in terms of exchange rates. I hope that this compromise will still be present at the time of the vote.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to express my regret, nonetheless, that it was not possible in this report to include both the subject of household debt and the improvement needed in the coordination of economic policies. Allow me, Mr President, to mention a number of points on which I believe this report provides original and valuable insights.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Consider, for example, the invitation made to the Central Bank to examine closely the use of EUR 500 notes and the possibility of freezing the issue of these notes. Let us come now to the key issue for this Parliament, namely the conditions in which democratic control is exercised and the way in which the Central Bank operates as an institution. From this point of view, we wanted to make our contribution, before the next renewal of a member of the Executive Board, to the necessary debate that must take place among the institutions in order that the members of the Executive Board may represent the interests of the euro zone in the best way possible. We believe that, to this end, the best approach would be to apply to the ECB the arrangement seen on the executive boards of all other central banks, namely a variety of backgrounds and a balance of portfolios. We are in agreement within this Parliament on requesting that the balance between nations should not be enshrined as an eternal status quo, and we believe, moreover, that a variety of backgrounds should enable the contributions and plurality within the Executive Board to be enhanced.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I also hope that this Parliament will advocate that the Council, when giving its opinion on approving a nomination to the Board, should exercise its decision-making power in full by making its choice on the basis of a number of different candidates. I am familiar with the argument used frequently by yourself, Mr President of the European Central Bank, and also used by Jean-Claude Trichet from time to time: having several candidates would damage the careers of those not accepted for the position.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Allow me to say that, as observers of international nomination procedures, our assessment is entirely different. At international level, the only post that is filled without competition or without a variety of candidates – and I come from a party that, as you know, is currently experiencing this process and all its virtues – is the Presidency of the World Bank. This process does not apply in the case of the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the World Trade Organisation. That is why we believe that, from this point of view, the euro zone as an integrated area should allow a number of different candidates.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Obviously, we also request that the European Parliament should finally be given the power to approve the appointment of the members of the Executive Board, which, in my opinion, would only strengthen the Board’s authority and legitimacy and ability to embody a strong voice for the euro zone, on the international stage also. This is the primary objective of this Parliament, namely that, on the international stage, the Central Bank, alongside the Council and the Eurogroup, should be the key legitimate spokesman that we need for Europe’s voice to carry loud and clear on such important subjects as you have wanted to raise, Mr President, and on which this Parliament would like to make a contribution. I am of course thinking of the question of the alternative funds, on which, I hope, the compromise drawn up by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be supported by all the groups at the time of the vote.</p>

      <p sl="fr">European Central Bank. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and a great pleasure to speak to you today. I am here to present to the European Parliament the 2005 annual report of the European Central Bank. However, as you know, relations between Parliament and the European Central Bank go beyond the specific obligations imposed by the Treaty. In fact, as Mrs Berès has just said, we have over the years established a very close dialogue, which, I should like to emphasise, has been enhanced once again this year. Honourable Members, it is therefore the third time that I have spoken before you this month. Furthermore, my colleagues on the board of the ECB have been in close contact with the European Parliament regarding various issues such as reform of the International Monetary Fund, payment systems and clearing and settlement systems. For our part, we attach great importance to the contacts on these issues.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to start by giving you a brief overview of the economic and monetary policy developments of 2005 and by outlining the European Central Bank’s monetary policy measures. I would then like to make some comments with regard to points and proposals that you have raised in your draft resolution on the ECB’s annual report for 2005.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Let me first of all welcome the assessment of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee as regards the ECB’s monetary policy in 2005 and beyond. As recognised in the draft report, the ECB’s monetary policy – which is designed to fulfil our primary objective of maintaining price stability – has continued to be successful in anchoring inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, despite a number of challenges mentioned by Mrs Berès, relating in particular to the continued strong surge in oil prices until the most recent period.</p>
      <p sl="de">As already emphasised on several occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area, fully in line with Article 105 of the EC Treaty.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this respect, let me emphasise that the ECB’s open and transparent communication is a key element in guiding market expectations. In particular, my introductory statement at the press conference after the first Governing Council meeting each month provides a clear view, on the part of the Governing Council, on the current monetary policy stance in real time. Hence, we make the outcome of our deliberations public. As such, the introductory statement is comparable with what other central banks call ‘summary minutes’.</p>
      <p sl="de">In 2005, the ECB’s monetary policy operated in an environment of increasingly improving economic conditions. While real GDP growth remained moderate in the first half of the year, in an environment of heightened uncertainties surrounding domestic demand, the pace of economic activity gradually strengthened during the second half of the year, from around 1.2% year-on-year on average in the first half of 2005 to around 1.7% year-on-year on average in the second half. Overall, real GDP in the euro area grew by 1.4%.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards price developments, annual HICP inflation averaged 2.2% in 2005, compared to 2.1% in each of the two preceding years. While annual HICP inflation eased to 2.0% in the first half of 2005, mainly reflecting base effects, HICP inflation rates accelerated to levels significantly above 2% in the second half, reaching a peak of 2.6% in September, mainly on the back of substantial increases in energy prices.</p>
      <p sl="de">Thus, reviewing the ECB’s monetary policy decisions in 2005 and early 2006, it is useful to split this period into two parts. In the first half of 2005, against the background of subdued inflation developments and with inflation expectations for the euro area solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability, the Governing Council concluded that it remained appropriate to keep interest rates at their historically low levels. At the same time, the Governing Council was constantly alert with regard to the materialisation of upside risks to price stability, as signalled by both the ECB’s economic and monetary analyses.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the second half of 2005 and early 2006, the likelihood that average annual HICP inflation could remain above 2% over the medium term increased and a spill-over to inflation expectations had to be avoided. This scenario of elevated inflation rates remained subject to previously identified upside risks, notably further increases in oil prices and indirect taxes and, more particularly, potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting. It was also confirmed by the monetary analysis, given strong monetary growth, robust credit expansion and ample liquidity.</p>
      <p sl="de">As a consequence, by the end of 2005, the regular cross-checking of the ECB’s economic and monetary analyses indicated that an adjustment of the very accommodative stance of the ECB’s monetary policy was clearly warranted in order to contain upside risks to price stability and preserve the firm anchoring of long-term inflation expectations in the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB therefore decided in December to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after two and a half years of maintaining these rates at historically low levels. Since then the Governing Council has continued to withdraw monetary accommodation, thereby establishing the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.25% by now.</p>
      <p sl="de">Turning to recent developments, all the main indicators of economic activity in the euro area that have become available in the course of 2006 confirm the Governing Council’s assessment that economic growth has gained momentum and, in addition, become more broadly-based and sustained, mainly supported by domestic demand.</p>
      <p sl="de">With regard to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation rates, notwithstanding their decline in most recent months, will remain elevated, at levels above 2% on average in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards 2007, inflation risks remain on the upside. These risks include, in particular, a stronger than expected rise in wages on the back of improving labour markets and a stronger than expected pass-through of past oil price rises. The assessment of upside risks prevailing is confirmed when cross-checked with the monetary analysis, given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth, ample liquidity and, from a medium-term perspective, a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. This has been noted in the Commission report. Monetary developments therefore require enhanced monitoring, in particular against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area.</p>
      <p sl="de">As I said publicly on behalf of the Governing Council after our last decision, if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted. The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor all developments very closely, so as to ensure price stability over the medium to longer term.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards fiscal policy, budgetary developments in 2005 and 2006 and plans for 2007 point to further, albeit slow, improvements in budget balances. However, this should not give rise to complacency. It remains of the essence that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided, which would boost the confidence of both the markets and the public.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards structural reforms, I welcome the view of the European Parliament that comprehensive structural reforms are needed to raise the potential growth rate of the euro area and underpin the momentum of the ongoing economic recovery. In this respect, the reform measures initiated in the context of the renewed Lisbon Strategy were a welcome additional step in the right direction. The successful implementation of national reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would improve the smooth functioning of EMU and facilitate the conduct of the ECB’s single monetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">In your motion for a resolution you raise a large number of issues of relevance to the ECB and I would like to assure you that we will consider them with great care. I should like to share our assessment on two issues straight away, in view of their topical nature and the exchanges of views I and my fellow members of the Executive Board had with you on those points.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the motion for a resolution, the ECB is called upon to carry out further analysis in the area of hedge funds – a point you have underlined. Amid the increasing attention being paid to the activities of hedge funds, I think that it would be unfair not to mention their role as regards enhancing market liquidity, providing significant diversification opportunities for investors and fostering financial innovation. That being said, it is clear that there are potential risks for financial stability from their very rapidly growing presence in the financial system and it has yet to be tested whether they would amplify market volatility or pose greater counterparty risks in a less benign financial market environment. Against that background, the ECB will definitely follow up on your request for further analysis. It is possible that we will conclude that there is a real case for enhancing the current framework, which relies essentially on the vigilance of the financial institutions that are themselves under supervision as regards their counterparty risks on the hedge funds. But I also note that any such enhancement should be agreed upon at the level of the international community and, in particular, on the basis of an appropriate transatlantic discussion.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards payment and settlement issues, let me first thank the European Parliament for the support expressed for the implementation by November 2007 of the TARGET2 system. Being an integrated large-value payment system, TARGET2 will provide for efficiency gains and improved liquidity management by banks. In this regard, I should like to refer to the increased pressure also to have an integrated platform for the settlement of securities transactions in euro. The Eurosystem is therefore currently examining, in coordination with the European Commission and in close cooperation with the market, the feasibility of setting up a Eurosystem infrastructure for the provision of securities settlement services in central bank money. A decision on whether to offer such a service, referred to as ‘TARGET2-Securities’, is expected early in 2007. In the field of retail payments, we strongly support the efforts to establish a Single Euro Payment Area – SEPA. We welcome the European Commission’s initiative for a directive on payment services and I warmly welcome the European Parliament’s contribution to a swift adoption of this directive to assist the banking industry in its implementation of SEPA payment instruments as from 1 January 2008.</p>
      <p sl="de">I thank you very much for your attention. I am now available to answer your questions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, allow me to begin by saying that – as can be seen from the report – we generally endorse what the European Central Bank has done over the past year. It is particularly important that the independence of the ECB has been, and remains, secure.</p>
      <p sl="de">It has proven to be the case that the Bank’s moderate interest rates policy has contributed to the invigoration of the economy, even though that same policy has very often been criticised in recent years. That being the case, we believe that it would be absolutely right to raise the current level of interest rates, which is very low in historical terms, a little, if the situation so requires it, in order to control inflationary trends.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also welcome the ECB’s comments with regard to the necessary structural reforms in the Member States that it is constantly calling for. It is quite right to do this, as inflation would hit those on middle and lower incomes particularly hard. Higher inflation would make these people poorer. We are opposed to that.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also welcome the clear statement by the President of the ECB in relation to the development of European stock exchanges. It is imperative that we ensure that European stock exchanges are consolidated within Europe and are not simply taken over from abroad – from the US, for example. That is the only way that we can prevent the US Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act being implemented in Europe via the back door. We have sound and transparent market regulations in Europe that are suited to our European situation, and they should not be undermined.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards the report, we have resolutely advocated that the ECB does not become politicised. We, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are thus very clear in our rejection of the publication of ECB voting results. Doing so would lead to politicisation, because voting results would then be discussed. We are also opposed to a publicly debated nomination process, as qualified candidates would be discussed to death. We thus do not feel that we can support these two elements, as they would mean politicisation of the ECB.</p>
      <p sl="de">We would, on the other hand, like to point out that, if the ECB becomes a market operator in the areas of settlement and the clearing of payments and instalments within the framework of TARGET 2, it must also subject itself to appropriate corporate governance. Corporate governance of this nature still has to be developed. The independence of the ECB will then be ensured and that will result in a stable economic policy that will call for structural reforms in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I shall refrain from dwelling, on behalf of my group, on the first part of Mr Trichet’s account or on what Mr Lauk stated a moment ago. Suffice for me to say that I welcome such a political dialogue – as Mr Lauk’s viewpoint is also a political viewpoint obviously – with you on a regular basis. We have ourselves conducted such a dialogue only recently, and I think we should persevere with it. The report that is now before us reflects, in my view, just how mature this dialogue has become, touching, as it does, upon very serious subjects, including the link between monetary policy and macro-economic policy, which is of huge importance to our group. Allow me to single out two or three items which have been subject of discussion.</p>
      <p sl="nl">First of all, I am delighted with what Mr Trichet had to say about hedge funds, his commitment to better analysis of them and to the adoption of a much more serious stance with respect to them. Whilst we stated this in very specific terms a few weeks ago during the dialogue, he was a little more hesitant back then. I am therefore pleased that this has now been spelled out much more clearly – I have referred to this in a different connection as the black hole of the financial markets – because that black hole is widening all the time and must be plugged very deliberately by monitoring financial markets, not least with stability in mind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The second point is the appointment of the members of the ECB’s Executive Board. In the spring, we debated this very subject further to Mr Stark’s appointment. We then said quite clearly, because we did not have anything against Mr Stark himself, who was well-qualified, but wanted to talk about the procedure, that we would not dwell on the appointment procedure and would come back to it in this report, which is what we are doing now.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I regret that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats refuses to help improve – by making it more fully-developed – this appointment procedure, and also the role we in this House can play in this. I am pleased, though, that at least the Liberals and other groups are prepared to lend their support. I hope that we can make the necessary progress in time for the next appointment, which, as it happens, will not be until 2009/2010. This is very important, because it should not be the case that large countries have a qualified seat and that it is, in this case, only in the Federal Chancellery in Berlin that it is decided who is a good candidate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I should like to turn to the subject of Target II. We have clearly decided not to speak out on this, or on the code of conduct that is being prepared by the Commission for that matter, but to closely monitor your next move instead. What we would say at this stage is that if, and only if, the ECB and the euro system are to have an active decision-making role in this, this should involve sound monitoring and democratic decision-making; that much we agree on.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this report does, in any event – and indeed, as has already been indicated – represent an opportunity to take another good look at not only the ECB’s annual report but also at where we as Parliament stand in the debate on monetary policy. I have to say that this time round, as indeed in recent years, my group has taken a traditional line. First of all, our viewpoint on monetary policy is clear. The ECB’s independence may not be affected, there should be no political pressure and we must prevent monetary policy in the euro zone from being politicised.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We believe that there is a need for confidence in the European Central Bank to be restored. In September 2005, when the rate of inflation rose by 2.6%, the European Central Bank responded well by increasing the historically very low interest rate. Price stability is the ECB’s Number One priority and that is how it should stay, as described in the Treaty. Having said this, we also take the view, and will do in future, that more transparency is possible. This is, in fact, what Mr Huhne said as long as six years ago, when he produced a report on this. I also value the ECB's efforts on this score, and the President’s being present in this plenary is a very different matter – although the same people are involved – from his visits to us in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs; this is also very much appreciated; and I also think that this has not been done before.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Despite this, much of the ECB’s decision-making is done in what appears to us to be dark backrooms. It is, of course, not the case that we want the whole of the European Parliament and the BBC to attend the meetings of the ECB’s Executive Board, but we would like to know the arguments in favour or against any decisions taken and whether these were taken unanimously or not, so that the market can gain a better insight into monetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, we would ask that the procedure for appointing members of the ECB’s Executive Board be reviewed. We think the current de facto division of ECB seats according to the size of Member States should be abandoned. This should not involve a major public debate, but choosing from various candidates really strikes us as being a better system.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since we are discussing the European Central Bank’s report, allow me to address these few words to its president.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr Trichet, you really are the reviver of a very poor system for all the peoples of Europe. As such, you have probably been – inadvertently, otherwise it would have been common knowledge – the best campaigner for the ‘no’ vote of the French and Dutch people on the European Constitutional Treaty, and we thank you for it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The principles on which the European Central Bank is founded are already in themselves an obstacle to growth in the euro zone, but when there is growth, in spite of your actions, it creates few or no jobs and only benefits the richest in society. The European Central Bank claims to have stopped inflation. In reality, the working and middle classes have seen their purchasing power plummet, while the rich have never been so rich. You champion the worst kind of capitalism, that of shareholders and the pauperisation of the middle and working classes. Day after day, your inertia faced with the weak dollar policy pursued by the United States destroys thousands of qualified industrial jobs creating added value in the euro zone. You represent the bank of discontent and mass unemployment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all these reasons, we must break with a European Central Bank controlled by the financial markets and with no link to the will of the peoples of the Union. We urgently need a new treaty entrusting the European Central Bank with responsibilities in the field of employment, training and research, all under the strict control of our Parliament and the national parliaments. This new treaty must, imperatively, replace the financial stability pact with a social progress pact for employment and growth, reviving public spending throughout the Union on health, training, education, social housing, culture, transport and infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Through these decisions we will be able to restore the confidence of the European people. If this were not the case, the gap would continue to widen between our institutions and the various peoples. The differences in wealth between the peoples of the Union and between citizens of a single country would continue to increase. This would therefore encourage the rise of extremism and anti-European nationalism.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, here we are again telling the European Central Bank how to do its job! Not only is this against the spirit of the Treaty, which states that the ECB is independent, it is also largely a waste of time, because, as always, the ECB will listen politely but, quite rightly, take little notice. Indeed, the ECB has enough trouble of its own, without listening to this Parliament, in finding an interest rate that suits 12 different economies, soon to be more.</p>
      <p sl="de">The one-size-fits-all problem does not go away. At the moment, the larger euro zone economies are enjoying slightly higher growth but, as Mr Trichet accepts, this is fragile. When it falters, his problem of choosing the right interest rate will become more critical. Effectively, the ECB will be forced into a choice between inflation in Germany or recession in southern Europe, with all the dire implications for government debts that this will entail.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wonder what advice this Parliament will be giving then.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, in this Chamber yesterday we were debating breast cancer, and no one appeared worried about the fight against inflation. That is to say that in situations of life and death our priorities change: we discover what is truly important.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, is the fight against inflation really the most important thing in economic life? Beginning our resolution with a reference to the Father-like status of the independence of the Central Bank, followed by the Son-like status of price stability, in the hope that the Holy Spirit of prosperity will descend from the United States may be good for the independence of the Central Bank, but it is bad for the people. Personally, Mr Trichet, I fully appreciate that you are bound by monetary aggregates one, two and three and by the need for fine-tuning and for steering interest rates. Yet even in the country of Milton Friedman, Chile is left to practise a budgetary surplus of 1%, while the United States itself takes a budgetary overdose. I must therefore conclude by asking the real question: just because our German grandmother had inflationist diabetes in the 1920s, should that mean that, 80 years on, the whole of Europe should go on a sugar-free budgetary and monetary diet?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses the European Central Bank’s position on currency stability. We should not succumb to the temptation to add to the ECB’s responsibilities areas in which the nation states refuse to act, in other words the areas of economic and social reforms. The ECB cannot pay for such reforms alone, nor can it afford to. In this case it is essential that the nation states finally fulfil their obligations.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also support the independence of the European Central Bank, its political independence and the independence of its monetary policy, and all of this right from the selection procedure for its members. I do not know what the results of today's votes will be. I can only tell you that the European People's Party supports the idea of non-politicisation, starting with the selection procedure, and believes that the form of transparency proposed is not helpful. The European Central Bank has numerous other tools in its dialogue and does make use of them, just as other central banks around the world do. There is broad support for this in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the subject of independence, I would like to add that we are fighting for the independence of monetary policy. I also hope, however, that the European Central Bank realises that it should not overplay the subject of independence. We have had an on-going discussing with the European Central Bank for years now on the subject of ‘clearing and settlement’, in particular with Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell, and I would just like to remind the House that the European Central Bank has begun a dialogue with the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) on this subject and is now entering into a dialogue with those involved in the market.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to state clearly that we are not opposed to dialogue. Perhaps the route that the European Central Bank is proposing, and that it is taking, will be the right one in the end. For us, this is not about a material assessment, but the route by which the European Central Bank becomes a part of the market cannot be chosen unsupervised and in a vacuum cut off from politics. That is why we have been calling so urgently for this – and we hope that the vote today will proceed as we had all envisaged – we need governance, we need a regulatory framework for this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">We cannot have a situation where Parliament and the Commission are deliberating about whether to create a directive, whether to produce with a suitable framework, and the European Central Bank then comes out and claims that none of that affects it and that it will take the route it thinks is right. Do not overdo it here; where monetary policy is concerned, we are on your side.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, since its creation, the European Central Bank has fulfilled its primary mission, namely the fight against inflation. Rates of inflation in the euro zone have thus remained below those in the United States and Great Britain. The public is mistaken in believing that the euro has made prices soar. Admittedly, there was an inflationist surge during the transition to the euro, mainly in the catering and retail sectors, where prices were rounded up a little too high. That said, since this surge of initial excitement, underlying inflation has in general remained under control. The price boom on the oil and gas markets represents an external shock over which the Union has very little control. However, because the euro has risen against the dollar, which remains the currency in which raw materials are listed, the shock has been less severe for the euro zone than for the Americans.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The euro is in fact a shield that has protected the whole of Europe during events such as the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan or even 11 September 2001. Without the euro, many European currencies would have been under pressure and would have threatened the internal market with collapse. As Mr Zapatero pointed out, Spain would never have been able to withdraw its troops from Iraq if its currency had been the peseta instead of the euro. Although the euro has served Europe well, and although I congratulate the ECB on the work accomplished, I remain convinced that the ECB could do better. President Trichet and his colleagues attach too much importance to the fight against inflation, while inflationist risks remain very limited.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, the ECB refuses to lend its support to the Union's general economic policies and justifies its position by arguing that the Constitutional Treaty stipulates that maintaining price stability represents the only possible support for Europe's general economic policy. The ECB is independent and will remain so, even without Mr Radwan’s support. This is another reason to be open to dialogue. Those who are independent, Mr President, can allow themselves to maintain a more active cooperation with the Eurogroup, for example with a view to achieving more sustained economic development for Europe. Growth and stability are the two feet moving Europe forward.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Trichet and his colleagues for their solid cooperation thus far. The ECB annual report is a very important document for this House. It forms the basis of the debate on fundamental monetary policy issues. Not for nothing has the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs taken personal responsibility as rapporteur for this issue.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is, however, always controversy when we debate appointments to the ECB and the primary task of the Bank. We have just experienced this once again. It is therefore no surprise that it was only through innumerable compromise proposals that it was possible to achieve something like a common view in the committee. Personally speaking, I find it regrettable that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament abstained from the final vote in committee, despite all these compromises. Their decision shows the difficulties the Socialist Group still has with a handful of points in the report. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supported the independence of the ECB without ifs and buts.</p>
      <p sl="de">The primary function of the Bank is, and remains, to ensure the stability of the euro. Thus far, it has performed this job admirably. We cannot go soft on independence or on price stability under any circumstances. There must thus continue to be an absence of political pressure in future, and the members of the Executive Board must be chosen purely on the basis of their expertise and not according to nationality.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, yet again it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the ECB continues to print large numbers of 500-euro notes, which are only useful to those who are hoarding ill-gotten gains or laundering money. Indeed, the volume of printing has recently even gone up. Yet the Sunday Times in London recently published an extensive article detailing much evidence about the use of these notes in Spain, Italy and Greece, directly for money-laundering purposes. The only possible conclusion we can reach is that the ECB is actively involved in aiding and abetting money laundering.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I would like to express a favourable opinion of the activities of the European Central Bank in 2005. I would also like to categorically state that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully supports and respects the independence of the Central Bank. We believe that this independence is a sine qua non for conducting an appropriate monetary policy within the economic and monetary union. It also guarantees the value of our common currency.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would now like to highlight three issues that have long been debated in this House. Firstly, the relative importance of the two pillars of monetary policy adopted by the ECB remains unclear. I refer here to monetary supply as opposed to other information on future inflation. As a result, we do not know whether, or to what extent, developments in monetary supply constitute a decisive factor for the ECB when setting interest rates. Laying down clear rules in this matter would improve the transparency and effectiveness of monetary policy.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, a clear interpretation of the ECB's mandate, as laid down in Article 105(1) of the Treaty, is urgently required. In particular, the ECB needs to state how it intends to fulfil its Treaty obligations to support the European Union’s economic policy while simultaneously maintaining price stability, and what resources it intends to draw upon to do so. I would point out that the Treaty draws a clear distinction between these two aims, and that they cannot therefore be deemed to be interchangeable. If the ECB adopted a clear stance on this question, it would be possible to avoid misunderstandings as to whether or not the ECB is responsible for attaining aims other than price stability.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thirdly, the ECB is mistaken in its interpretation of the inflation criterion applied in assessing how prepared new Member States are for entry into the euro zone. The Treaty clearly states that the point of reference should be the average inflation rate of, and I quote: ‘the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability’. The Treaty makes no mention of the lowest prices. The ECB defined price stability as a rate of inflation under 2% but close to 2%. However, when assessing the degree of preparedness of the candidate countries, the ECB applies another definition, namely the average of the three countries with the lowest inflation. There cannot be two different definitions of the same Treaty provision, and I therefore call on the ECB to clarify the situation.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, President Trichet, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation and debate in Parliament of the European Central Bank Annual Report 2005 is the annual account that makes the independence of the Central Bank compatible with its democratic control.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to make three brief comments on the impact of the monetary policy, the need for financial integration and the future composition of the Management Board.</p>
      <p sl="es">The objectives of the monetary policy are to control inflation and to contribute to economic objectives of a general nature. At the end of 2005, and following two and a half years without taking any action, the European Central Bank increased interest rates, inflation stood at 2 tenths above the 2%, and there was a modest growth in the euro zone of 1.4%.</p>
      <p sl="es">Those are the macroeconomic data, but the results of the monetary policy require that a more precise approach be taken, which I believe requires, on the one hand, an examination of internal divergences, which are considerable in terms of inflation and growth, amongst the Member States of the euro zone. This is important in order to ascertain the impact of the monetary policy, and, in particular, to ensure that there are no persistent imbalances. Secondly, we also need to know how these monetary policy conditions translate to the market and, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
      <p sl="es">During 2005, the European Central Bank published its first report on financial integration in the euro zone, and I congratulate it on that. It makes a very significant contribution. Accelerated globalisation is creating changes in financial products and markets that bring new challenges. When the single currency was drawn up, the risks of the system could be dealt with by means of monetary policy instruments. Now we need new initiatives. This is why it is important to carry on making progress on the Economic and Monetary Union, in order to achieve new goals, but also in order to maintain the efficiency of the monetary policy in the face of new challenges.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, on the composition of the Management Board, I am in favour of greater parliamentary control, in order to achieve more professionalism and competence, and also a gender perspective, Mr President. The group photo of its governing body contains just one woman.</p>

    <intervention id="4-024" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Jean-Claude Trichet" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="fr">European Central Bank Mr President, might I perhaps say a word or two, since a number of issues have been broached?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like first of all to thank the honourable Members. I have indeed been very alert to the precise nature of the remarks, observations and recommendations made to us.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the subject of independence, I should like to say, on behalf of all the members of the Executive Board and the Governing Council, how important it is to hear so very many MEPs state how crucial it is for the European Central Bank to be independent. I must confess that we should certainly not have been able to give the European economy its particular monetary and financial environment without the credibility conferred on us by this principle of independence recognised by your Parliament, by the whole world and by all market participants, wherever in the world they might be. The Bank’s independence is stated in the Treaty, it is a recognised fact and it is one of Europe’s basic assets.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like once again to thank all the MEPs who expressed themselves so clearly on this point.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Let me now deal with some of the other points raised, which are certainly important in the eyes of a number of Members of Parliament. I have to say that the question of the appointment of the members of the Executive Board is one that should be addressed to the executive branches, particularly the Council, because they are responsible for such matters. We are appointed according to the Treaty provisions and, as you know, not only does Parliament give its assessment of the quality of the various persons concerned, but so do we in the Governing Council. I know that Parliament would like to have not only an advisory role but also responsibility for the decision itself. I respect that sentiment. I realise that the ECB has to let Parliament and the Council discuss the matter, provided full independence and absence of politicisation are totally assured, for, clearly, if the institution were to suffer from politicisation, it would not be able to deliver what it has to deliver, namely, price stability, something which also depends on it enjoying sound credibility, so that inflation expectations can be firmly anchored.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the various remarks on the dialogue between Parliament and the ECB, in my opinion this dialogue has improved in terms of both frequency and interaction and I will take good note of all the remarks made here, including those concerning the governance of our possible Target2 Securities system. On that issue, which is dear to your heart, Mr Radwan, and to that of other Members of Parliament, I would say that our aspiration – and it is really a work in progress – was to maximise the benefits of European integration following the successful introduction of the euro, since it is clear that the availability of a single settlement engine for securities denominated in euros would undoubtedly represent progress.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second objective would be to maximise settlement efficiency and that would probably require cash and securities to be settled on the same IT platform, according to what is known technically as an ‘integrated model’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third issue, which is important from our own perspective, is how to maximise the Central Bank’s control over the bank accounts opened in our own book. We take a very strong line on this, believing that solutions which avoid forcing central banks to outsource the management of their accounts would not be good ones.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are the three main reasons why we are working on this matter, through a dialogue with the market, which is very important, and, of course, with Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A number of other points have been mentioned. I will not return to the matter of hedge funds raised by Mrs van den Burg, in particular. As to the question of whether or not we are sufficiently transparent and open as regards communication, I reiterate that we do not take decisions alone behind closed doors. The Commissioner and the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, are invited to all meetings of the Governing Council. They are also invited every fortnight to our discussions and deliberations, so that they can be as close as possible to the decisions taken. I myself have the privilege of appearing before the Eurogroup every month. So there are three opportunities each month to exchange views and gain as full as possible an understanding of how the decision-making process really works. It seems to me that, from that standpoint, we have the most highly-organised system of contacts anywhere in the world. It is not new; it was the tradition of the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and a number of central banks. Let us not underestimate its significance. Some of the remarks made fail to take this into account.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the transparency of our concept of monetary policy, we are in a position where we say that our primary goal is price stability, because that is what the Treaty stipulates. We give an arithmetical definition of price stability as inflation rates of below and close to 2%. Everyone is aware of this. We have a two-pillar strategy that is very clear. In that respect, we are much more transparent and precise. We provide a greater yardstick with which to measure our performance than other sister central banks do. I do not want to address myself to any of them in particular, but across the Atlantic there is a sister central bank which, for very good reasons of its own, has a different approach to the definition of price stability, with regard to the clarity of that goal. From that standpoint we are very transparent. The entire world knows that we are transparent and it is one of the reasons why inflation expectations are anchored in line with our definition of price stability, which is a fundamental result.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I should like to reply briefly to a number of MEPs. The fact that we are credible and that our predictions concerning inflation correspond to our definition of price stability offer the European economy a particularly favourable financial environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would ask those Members who have criticised our monetary policy, accusing it of being too orthodox, simply to remember what the rates of interest for the medium- and long-term markets in their countries were before the introduction of the euro. In reality, inflation predictions assumed a rate of inflation much higher than that which we ourselves are now able to guarantee to Europeans. It should be noted that low inflation represents, above all, a crucial factor for the poorest sections of our societies, preserving as it does their purchasing power. I noted, moreover, that many Members were asking us to remain very vigilant in this respect. I am, therefore, deeply convinced that there exists a very simple relationship between our primary objective, as assigned by the Treaty, and Article 105.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Meeting our primary objective is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of our being able to move in the direction desired by everyone in this Chamber, that being, of course, the direction of growth and employment. Price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and for the creation of lasting employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If I have time I shall make two or three other remarks. Regarding the 500-euro note, I do not agree at all with the remark that was made suggesting that we would actively assist money-laundering. As you know, large denomination notes were a strong tradition in many of the countries forming part of the euro area and we decided not to change the various traditions drastically. So the note is used in some countries, but not in others. It remains an option and we decided not to eliminate that option for those countries and economies that were used to it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe I have covered all the other questions that were raised. However, Mr Whittaker mentioned the ‘one-size-fits-all’ angle. Europe is a vast continental economy and, from 1 January next year when Slovenia joins, the euro zone will have 315 million citizens. This compares with 300 million in the United States and thus represents an economy of the same order of magnitude. When you measure the dispersion, the standard deviation of growth and of inflation at the level of various states of various different sizes, you will see that it is roughly the same for both economies. This is not widely known, but is worth pointing out, since it appears to be a characteristic of a vast continental economy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This does not mean that we have to cater for persistent differences, and it is one of the things that we have discussed, particularly in the Eurogroup. We need to reflect on this question, but again, it would probably be wrong to forget that an element of dispersion is always associated with the size of the economy concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I think I have covered most of the questions put, but it goes without saying that I remain at Parliament’s disposal.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mrs Berès’s report on the Annual Report (for 2005) of the European Central Bank is disappointing as it does not sufficiently underline the need for political reflection on the use of the euro to support growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In an ever more complex world, characterised by an extremely violent economic and social war, not to have an extensive and high-quality political debate on this subject is, at present, an error but may, in future, prove to have been an act of negligence. The European Central Bank and its President, Mr Trichet, must not lose sight of the fact that Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community clearly indicates that, without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the European System of Central Banks shall support the EU’s economic policies. At a time when increases in the prices of raw materials and of energy are giving rise to natural inflationary tensions in the world, we need to reflect on the impact of this situation on our internal market and our common currency, while seriously asking ourselves whether the time might not have come to develop the euro so that, as well as being a truly remarkable technical success, it is also a political currency.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I would like to endorse the rapporteur’s motion as well as what Mr Swoboda has said. As rapporteur on financial planning, I would also point out that this ill-starred proposal is based on the conclusions of the European Council and that the Commission was obliged to come up with a proposal for this so-called voluntary modulation.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the course of the financial planning negotiations we explicitly reserved our position for the legislative process. That is exactly what the rapporteur is now observing.

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, I regret that paragraphs 18 and 44 of the Grech report were not subject to a split vote, as I would have voted against them. A number of members of the Commission on Budgets continually mount rearguard actions against the decisions of Heads of State or Government regarding our Parliament’s three places of work. It is true that having three sites gives rise to costs. To call such expenditure ‘superfluous’ is, however, inappropriate, to say the least. Decentralisation also has some very positive repercussions for MEPs and for Parliament. Moreover, to bring into question the need for our officials to be present in Strasbourg during plenary part-sessions is a veritable affront to the administration which, I know, is very careful in choosing the officials it sends out.</p>

By purchasing the three buildings in Strasbourg that it did not own, Parliament has, indeed, obtained real bargains. This is an extremely judicious piece of expenditure which, unlike expenditure on rent, will enable large public savings to be made. I should have liked a number of members of the Committee on Budgets to have made a more objective judgment, especially since they are required to respect decisions concerning Parliament’s seat, whether they like them or not.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In view of the structural, economic and social situation in the fishing sector in the outermost regions, and the adoption of the new European Fisheries Fund, it is crucial to extend the derogations laid down in Regulation (EC) 639/2004 on the criteria and conditions governing structural actions relating to the preservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The proposal for a Council regulation providing for an extension of these derogations for the outermost regions until 31 December 2006 and the practical implementation of measures adopted in the interim by 2008, must of course be adopted at the earliest opportunity, so that it can actually have the desired effect on the ground.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The purpose of this proposal is to extend the derogations granted to fishing fleets in the outermost regions until 31 December 2006, and subsequently until 31 December 2007. These derogations relate to the entry/exit schemes of the fleet capacity and the provision of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It was a matter of great urgency that this proposal be adopted, in view of the specific structural, social and economic realities of the fishing industry in the outermost regions, for example the Azores and Madeira, coupled with the permanent difficulties and constraints faced by these regions, such as their limited markets and their remoteness.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The crux of the matter is that the existing economic activities – in this case fisheries – of many of these regions are of major socio-economic importance, for example in ensuring that people have fresh fish to eat.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given the need for these derogations, and in view of the fact that the situation facing the fleets is down to structural rather than economic factors, as the Commission and the Council have acknowledged, the derogations should be made permanent and be included in the European Fisheries Fund for 2007-2013.</p>

      <p sl="fr">This regulation takes account of circumstances in the fishing sector in the outermost regions, where there are still abundant fishery resources and significant potential for development.

      <p sl="fr">Nevertheless, I find it regrettable that the European Commission has still not put forward any longer-term guidelines. I have already asked on numerous occasions for these derogations to be extended beyond 2006.

Many Syrian residents were forced to flee abroad, because they otherwise faced being locked up or disappearing utterly, and no organised opposition is permitted. Not only political opponents, but also Kurds and Christians feel themselves under threat. In neighbouring Lebanon, Syria was responsible for years of military occupation, for political assassinations and for arming Hezbollah. In another of its neighbours, Israel, it is considered to be a most unreasonable neighbour, one that never wants peace or reconciliation, and Syria’s actions can be used as one of the arguments not to actively broker a peace agreement with a Palestinian neighbour.

      <p sl="pt">Although this is, broadly speaking, a balanced report in the version negotiated by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I still have one or two reservations about its adoption.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As a result of both its status and logistical difficulties, the EU has neither the power nor the ability to act as a world power. It also has neither the military nor the financial resources to do so, and most importantly, it does not have such a mandate. This does not mean, however, that the EU should be a passive member of the international community. The dimensions of Europe as a market, as a provider of financial aid, as a place of refuge for immigrants, and as a neighbour make, or ought to make, the EU a partner in external policy. I am not talking about the traditional reference to the virtues of soft power or the debate on the need for alternative axes. What I am referring to is the ability that the EU should have, on account of these dimensions, to influence and change policy in the Mediterranean, one of the most important regions in the world.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the medium term, the EU should be capable of having the same effect on its neighbours as it has had on the countries that have joined it in successive rounds of enlargement. What we should be doing is reproducing in our Mediterranean neighbours the effects of pre-accession expectations. Unfortunately, this agreement does not convey that ambition.</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the need to complete the Rhine-Rhone link. This link is an extremely important route that will enable us to connect the South of France and the Western Mediterranean with the Rhine-Main-Danube basin, and hence with the new and emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe all the way to the Black Sea. In my opinion, this programme is a top priority, and I hope that it is to the completion of this link – the technical and environmental difficulties of which I am well aware of but do not consider to be insurmountable – that the resources mobilised under this programme will be allocated as the first priority.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Wortmann-Kool report calls for the active promotion of inland waterway transport, which is currently underdeveloped.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This safe, environmentally-friendly mode of transport with a lot of free capacity on its infrastructure, can contribute to modal shift and ease the congestion problems affecting other transport modes.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It also strikes me that the increase in trade since the enlargement will help develop new markets, such as this form of transport.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The adoption of measures aimed at redressing the balance between different forms of transport is hugely important for the future of a sustainable transport policy. As such, I am strongly in favour of developing the inland waterways transport network, which, from the developmental stage, can encompass all of the strategic areas that are important in optimising the development of this market.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Consequently, and bearing in mind the diverse characteristics of European territory, it is vital to establish an appropriate legal framework that will allow for the development of markets, which may, in turn, help move traffic over to alternative forms of transport. As a Portuguese MEP, I therefore support this programme, which does not foster national self-interest, and which I believe will have a positive impact on the transport market in Portugal.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Public-private partnerships are very popular in EU Member States, and, somewhat inevitably, the United Kingdom is the European champion. Unfortunately, though, they are a euphemism for the privatisation, or preparation for the privatisation, of public assets and services, which will be put up for sale, over the longer term, for private investors to make profit from them. This, say the proponents, will lead to better risk management. What they overlook, however, is that private firms keep the profits and the State always ends up carrying the can when the partnership turns sour or fails to deliver the profits that the private businesses were looking for. This applies right across the board, in areas as diverse as the outsourcing of motorways, the management of hospitals and schools, and the incorporation of investment projects within the scope of the Structural Funds.</p>
      <p sl="pt">They are a means of outsourcing the State’s responsibilities, and this is something we find unacceptable. What is more, this initiative is seeking Community-level legal arrangements. We therefore have no choice but to vote against the report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community legal framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs) does indeed need to be clarified. However, this clarification needs to comply with a number of principles: in particular, it must indeed relate only to partnerships between the public and private sectors; it must be based on a distinction between partnerships/contracts on the one hand and partnerships/concessions on the other, respecting the characteristic features of each and therefore avoiding new specific regulations for PPPs; it must not call into question the rules of the negotiated procedure applicable to concessions; it must give the national public authorities the freedom to choose the structure (creation of mixed economy companies or other legal forms, a public structure taking control of a private business, outsourcing, etc.); and, finally, it must ensure that any Community initiative is consistent with the needs of the public services and national choices in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="fr">None of this is likely to require the adoption of new binding legal documents, but, since it seems inevitable that the European Union will intervene in such matters, let us at least ensure that it does not lead to the creation of one of the bureaucratic machines for which the Europe of Brussels seems to have the secret recipe.</p>

      <p sl="el">Public private partnerships are the back door by which the public service sector can penetrate and be handed over to private capital. They are the basic route by which European capital can appropriate public infrastructures and services and circumvent the obstacles and problems which it encounters.</p>
      <p sl="el">They are also the mechanism for buying off consciences, disorientating the grassroots movement and limiting support for the public sector, by gradually privatising and commercialising services of general interest, especially at local government level. The objective is to increase the profits of big business and intensify exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="el">Any efforts made in the report for conditional use of PPPs and democratic control of them are simply an alibi and wish list which ultimately facilitate the general and exponential transfer of services to the control of private capital, with damaging consequences for the workers, consequences that appear to be concealed in the report itself.</p>

The Posted Workers Directive is closely related to the Services Directive and, despite an intense and justifiable struggle by MEPs from the new Member States, the European Parliament in the first reading omitted Articles 24 and 25 from the draft Directive on services in the internal market.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We consider these articles to be crucial, as the basic ideas of the Posted Workers Directive are interpreted differently in different Member States, and workers are generally unaware of their rights as guaranteed by the Directive.

The Schroedter report on the posting of workers calls for extra bureaucracy such as prior declarations from companies intending to post workers and the requirement to keep detailed time sheet records, etc. Such practices are disproportionate, promote protectionism and undermine the services directive.

      <p sl="nl">The Posting of Workers Directive 96/71/EC is an important milestone in European labour legislation. The Schroedter report highlights problems with the directive’s application, thus responding to a Commission communication – promised back in 2004 but not appearing until April 2006 – in which the Commission has tried, by referring to Court of Justice rulings, to restrict the control measures available to the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Schroedter report redraws the balance between economic liberalisation and social protection.

      <p sl="fr">It is a fact: the directive on the posting of workers has not been properly implemented in some Member States and is not fulfilling its objectives.

Parliament has said it is opposed to such a situation, on the grounds of complexity and unfairness, instead proposing a Board of Governors comprising just nine members.

      <p sl="en">The policy of the Conservative Party in relation to the euro is clear: we are firmly committed to keeping the pound. Nevertheless, as the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular are our largest trading partners, we are ever vigilant of the need for the euro's stability, since this directly affects Britain's prosperity. We therefore reserve the right to make ourselves heard when we believe that unwarranted political pressure is being directed against the independence of the European Central Bank. In the last year, as interest rates have been raised from their historic low, the ECB has been under political attack, and an attempt was made to use this report to interfere in its management.

      <p sl="fr">Since the euro was introduced seven years ago, the purchasing power of the people of Europe has fallen considerably. In the 'Euro zone', we have seen a real increase in prices for household goods and leisure, and an even clearer trend in housing due to a lack of monitoring of speculative funds. It is therefore the working and middle classes who are hardest hit, even without adding excess debt to the mix.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Economic growth in the 'Euro zone' has even fallen: the GDP volume has gone from an increase of 1.8% in 2004 to an increase of 1.4% in 2005. The prospects for 2007-2013 are even more worrying, because the Euro will present a greater risk to European growth once the exchange rate with the dollar becomes too favourable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Not only does this bank, with its ultra-European foundations and philosophy, demonstrate a democratic deficit and a certain lack of transparency, but it will not even achieve any of the European Union's economic and social objectives. These indicators should make it clear that we should get out of the Euro zone and that the individual nations should regain their competence for economic, social and monetary decision-making in a free Europe where protection and national and Community preference take first place.</p>

      <p sl="de">Time and time again, the ECB argues that price stability is its contribution to job creation and growth. In the euro zone, price stability is a reality; in quite a few sectors, indeed, aggregate rates of price increase below two per cent are opening the door to deflation, but as soon as there is the slightest indication of economic recovery in the euro zone, the only way the ECB, with its blind fixation on price stability, knows how to respond is by raising interest rates. It does that despite the absence of even the least sign of inflationary tendencies, even though there is no change in the prevalent mass unemployment and wages are rising more slowly than productivity, which, in the long term, cannot do other than lead to serious imbalances in the national economies. It does it even though even the capital markets, with their extremely low long-term interest rates, are indicating that they expect the future to bring neither a substantial increase in prices, nor sustainable economic recovery, and a look across the Atlantic reveals that they have little reason to do so.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Tibet has been under Chinese occupation for over 50 years. The Chinese authorities have been pursuing a policy of discrimination and persecution, aimed at marginalising Tibetans in their own homeland. The Chinese army has recently carried out yet another barbaric killing. On this occasion a defenceless Tibetan nun was murdered crossing the border into Nepal. China denies that shots were fired at Tibetan refugees attempting to enter Nepal, but the entire incident was caught on film.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The House cannot remain silent and indifferent to these latest events. The policy of force and repression imposed on the people of Tibet by the Chinese authorities can no longer be tolerated.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I hereby call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to stop violating the human rights of the Tibetan nation and of other minorities. I also appeal to the Chinese Government to guarantee that it will respect international law, international human rights standards and freedom of religion. Tibet must be granted genuine autonomy and the Tibetan people must be allowed freedom of religion and education.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I also call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to accelerate the dialogue begun with representatives of the Dalai Lama, and to seek to arrive, without further delay, at a solution to the issue of Tibet that is acceptable to both parties.</p>

      <p sl="de">On this occasion – unlike in many other instances – a video is in existence to clearly demonstrate that the opposite is the case. This video shows that the Tibetan refugees did not attack; that, on the contrary, the group of people trying to cross the border was composed of young people, children, nuns and monks. The European Union must firmly repudiate the Chinese account of what happened, and demand clarification of the matter.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, there has been another incident with fatal consequences at the border between China and Nepal. When, on 30 September, a group of Tibetans – all of them unarmed civilians – attempted to flee over the Nangpa Pass to Nepal, Chinese border guards opened fire on them. Kelsang Namtso, a seventeen-year-old nun, was killed; many people were wounded, and thirty arrested, among them women and nine children.</p>
      <p sl="de">I wish to echo what was said by the previous speakers. This tragedy would never have come to light had it not been for a Romanian camera crew that was on the scene by chance and filmed what happened. The pictures they took appeared on Dutch television at peak viewing time. Despite this documentation, Peking maintains that there were injuries but no deaths and that, moreover, it had been the Tibetans who had opened fire and the Chinese had been obliged to defend themselves.</p>
      <p sl="de">We condemn this brutal action on the part of the Chinese security forces and call on the authorities to treat their captives in a humane manner and in compliance with international agreements, for China is a signatory to the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child, which protects minors from arrest and from arbitrary treatment on the part of the state.</p>
      <p sl="de">What happened at the Nangpa Pass must be investigated with the minimum possible delay, and those responsible must be called to account for their actions. These attacks on defenceless civilians must be put on the agenda for the next EU/China dialogue on human rights.</p>
      <p sl="de">I urge those representing the Commission to get an idea for themselves of what is going on, to go to the Tibetan Welfare Centre in Katmandu, as our ad hoc delegation from this House did in July when we went to Nepal, to ask the refugees arriving there about the things they have had to endure, and to do something about it!</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, this Parliament is right in once more expressing its indignation, and the unfortunate fact is that I expect it will have to do so many times more. The situation in Tibet is getting worse rather than better, and we may actually be to blame for this. Even before 1951, the European countries accepted that Tibet should be part of China, even though it was not described as such on maps. That is how it stayed when in the 50s, the People’s Republic of China actually brought this inhospitable region under its control with military means, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Tibet has now become more easily accessible from China via the world’s highest railway line. Foreign mountaineers witnessed recently how inhabitants who tried to flee the country were simply gunned down. The government, and probably the majority of public opinion in China, consider Tibet, above all, as a region that is still virtually empty and that needs to be colonised by Chinese people from the most densely populated areas. Since the Chinese economy is more than ever intertwined with the European economy, Europe has a powerful lever. The question is whether we are prepared to use this lever. Oppression will persist if we do not bring any pressure to bear.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, China’s Communist occupation of Tibet is a long-standing scourge on democracy and an open wound on the principles of justice and freedom. Time and again, we have strongly condemned the thoroughly indefensible and brutal way the Chinese regime has been treating a small peace-loving nation, isolated at the roof of the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the latest incident, China’s occupation forces opened fire on a group of unarmed, defenceless civilians who were attempting in desperation to flee their country through the glacial pass at Nangpa, situated at a height of almost 19 000 feet. The group included many women and children. A 17-year old nun was killed; a 20-year old was seriously injured; some individuals are missing and 29 people, including 14 children, were arrested. Some succeeded in escaping to neighbouring Nepal. Luckily and thankfully, the incident was witnessed by a number of foreign mountaineers, whose independent and trustworthy accounts, including a video, utterly contradicted the ridiculous lies about what happened put forward in an official statement by the Chinese authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">We in Europe have a lot to say when it comes to condemning actions of totalitarian and oppressive regimes, but in practice the severity of our words is not matched by our deeds. Apart from being regrettable, this is also highly hypocritical, in my view. The colonial-style occupation of Tibet by China, as, indeed, any colonial occupation of one country by another, has to end forthwith. To demonstrate that we mean what we say, we must take tangible measures against China. Yes, we have an arms embargo against that country, but it has little effect. What would really be effective is if we had a trade import ban on China; that would really cause headaches to the Communist leaders in Beijing and would lead to some sensible responses to our demands for freedom for Tibet.</p>

No force, threat or resistance was offered to the Chinese border guards. None of the refugees had a weapon of any kind, not even a knife.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, despite the fact that official relations between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama were restored in 2002, human rights continue to be infringed in Tibet on a regular basis. It is estimated that every year 2 500 people decide to escape from repression and undertake the dangerous journey to Nepal, lasting several days. The acts of violence perpetrated against unarmed civilians have given rise to particular concern. These acts include the shots fired at refugees by Chinese border guards in the Nangpa La pass in September of this year. The group of fugitives concerned was attempting to cross the Tibetan border and included women, children and monks. To date, the Chinese authorities have not accepted responsibility for this incident, in which one person was killed. The fate of several children detained by the military is still unknown.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is incumbent upon international institutions to take decisive and effective action to compel the Government of the People’s Republic of China to put an end to its repression of the people of Tibet, its inhumane treatment of prisoners, its use of torture and its extra-judicial executions.

The difference this time compared to previous occasions, however, is that we have filmed evidence demonstrating that the Chinese authorities’ attempts to deny these events are deceitful and that, at the same time, the Xinhua news agency’s attempts to show that this action was in self-defence is entirely without foundation.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are therefore dealing with an event that clearly requires investigation, as other speakers have said. I agree with that and I support it, but, furthermore, it also deserves to be treated as a fundamental issue within the framework of European Union-China dialogue. I would insist that this is not the first time, but it is really becoming rather sad that, since we have the opportunity to hold this dialogue with China, and on the eve of the 2008 Olympic Games, we do not stress over and over again that the Tibet situation could be resolved if there were truly a little political will on the part of the Chinese authorities.

      <p sl="en">Approximately 2500 Tibetans – possibly more – annually flee across the border from the Himalayas into exile. They are certainly escaping from the brutality of China’s occupation, but it is not necessarily as Mrs Sinnott suggests.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is difficult to know how many are caught or shot by the Chinese border authorities, because the allegations have generally remained uninvestigated. This particularly horrendous shooting incident on 30 September is in violation of the basic UN principles on the use of force and firearms by law-enforcement officials. It is interesting that there are guidelines as to when law-enforcement officials can shoot, but these require that they should not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury. Those of us who have seen the video clips of this incident know that the situation was not one involving grave threats to life. It appeared to be an unprovoked attack.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why the motion for a resolution before us is very important, in particular paragraph 8, which urges the Council and the Commission to reiterate their position regarding dialogue between the appropriate authorities.

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the resolution we are to vote on today concerns the events of 30 September, when Chinese policemen shot at a group of Tibetan refugees seeking freedom beyond the People’s Republic of China. It was certainly not the first incident of its kind. It was unusual, however, in that this barbaric behaviour was caught on film. Television and the Internet enabled us all, along with millions of others around the world, to see for ourselves what the Chinese policy on Tibet actually amounts to.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The fate of the Tibetan people is particularly unfortunate because they are one of the most peace-loving nations in the world. The Dalai Lama is not demanding independence for Tibet. The Tibetans are prepared to exist within the framework laid down in the Chinese constitution. How can it be possible to shoot at such people? How can they be persecuted and killed, simply because of their desire for a small measure of freedom and for the protection of their cultural heritage? Can this tragic course of events be halted? It can be, if orders are issued to ban the shooting of people fleeing from a country they do not wish to live in. This happened in the past, rather closer to home, on the border between East and West Germany. Great nations cannot and must not base their authority on the massacre of defenceless refugees.</p>

      <p sl="en">The matter has been formally taken up by the European Union in the framework of the last session of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 19 October, as rightly mentioned by the honourable Member from Finland. On that occasion, the European Union refuted the claim by China that the shooting had been in self-defence, urged the Chinese Government to undertake a thorough investigation of the incident and insisted that the imprisoned refugees be treated in compliance with international humanitarian standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">More generally, the Commission is very concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet, and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. This issue has been regularly addressed during the bilateral dialogue on human rights as well as at the highest level, during bilateral summits.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is particularly concerned about the number of Tibetans from religious backgrounds who are in prison for political reasons, and has repeatedly asked for their immediate release. Several of these people are on the list of individual cases regularly submitted to the Chinese authorities on the margins of these dialogues.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes that China’s policy in Tibet is not consistent with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The early ratification by China of this covenant ranks among the top priorities of the European Union in the field of human rights and we have left China in no doubt as to the need to fully respect the spirit of that covenant, once it has been signed and even before it is ratified.</p>
      <p sl="en">As part of its overall policy vis-à-vis Tibet, the European Union has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet. We have therefore welcomed and closely monitored the five rounds of talks so far held between the special envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission urges both sides to continue this dialogue and use these talks to try to make substantive progress.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, unlike Tibet, we have not often talked about Guatemala in this House, at least since I have been here. Nevertheless, it is a small Central America country that has suffered very harsh repression for many years, a brutal dictatorship, and the people responsible for it have so far escaped any form of punishment.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Spanish High Court has issued an international arrest warrant and what we are doing here is supporting the extradition of General Ríos Montt, the person bearing the greatest responsibility, and of five other generals, some of whom were de facto Presidents, that is, dictators, during that thirty-year period in which 200 000 people were murdered, 45 000 disappeared and a tenth of the population was displaced; the enormous majority of the displaced population – 83% – belonged to the Mayan community. There have also been European victims, however, Belgian and Spanish, particularly priests.</p>
      <p sl="es">I believe, Mr President, that just as we in this House supported the extradition of Pinochet and of Fujimori, it is right for us now to support the extradition of General Ríos Montt and his accomplices, and unanimously if possible.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I naturally agree with what my colleague, Mr Yáñez-Barnuevo, has just said, because ten years after the peace agreements in Guatemala were signed, a country that has aspirations to be a member of the Security Council and with which an association agreement is being negotiated, has yet to implement the global agreement on human rights. That is truly worrying in a country which, as has been pointed out, has been the victim of dictatorships, genocides, crimes against humanity, and – most seriously – the people responsible for them are still lording it around the country and around the world unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="es">We must therefore welcome, as we do in this Resolution, the fact that on 7 July the Spanish High Court issued this international arrest warrant. This will to a certain extent make it possible to begin to put an end to this impunity and genuinely make the people responsible pay for what they did.</p>
      <p sl="es">We should do more than that, however. We must also call for effective cooperation from the Guatemalan authorities in this field. We must naturally ask them, within this context of increasing cooperation, to be as cooperative as possible, so that, on the basis of this international ruling, they can contribute to the arrest, return and trial of these people. We must also ask for the cooperation of the banking authorities, which have been holding the profits and wealth that those people have been enjoying, in order to ensure that the latter assume their civil and financial responsibilities.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like finally to say that it would be very useful for Europol and Interpol to be able to cooperate in this work as much as they can.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Guatemala has a long and bloody history of violence behind it, and one certainly must not be partial in one’s judgment when considering it, for, while there were terrible dictatorships and repressions, there was also an equally cruel and bloodthirsty revolutionary movement in the shape of the Tupamaros.</p>
      <p sl="de">Over three decades have passed since the eyes of all Germany were fixed on this part of Central America, when the German ambassador Karl Graf Spreti – whose son is a member of my staff – was abducted and murdered. Karl Graf Spreti was one of the great men who prepared the way for Europe; he was also a member of the German Bundestag for my party, but it was as a diplomat and an innocent man that he was taken away and put to a cruel death in the primeval forest. Since then, the country has gone through a period of terrible crises. It is for that reason that we must be very careful, but also very firm, in supporting the peace process there by unambiguously denouncing those who, while in positions of power, had recourse to violence, as well as those who misused the word ‘freedom’ as a justification for doing the same thing.</p>
      <p sl="de">Guatemala has also, repeatedly, been the scene of gruesome acts of genocide, and it is cause for gratitude that the resolution does not mince its words about the expulsion of some 10% of the Maya, a people with an ancient culture, and the murder of tens of thousands of them.</p>
      <p sl="de">We also need to seize this opportunity to tighten up our definition of genocide. It is said repeatedly that the term ‘genocide’ may be used only when a group is systematically exterminated. That is not so: it is also genocide to deprive an ethnic grouping of its basis for existence by robbing it of its homeland by means of expulsion and murderous violence. That has happened to many ethnic groups, not only to the Maya but also to smaller groupings in Guatemala. There is no statute of limitations applicable to such crimes, and that is why we must leave no stone unturned in bringing those responsible for them to account rather than turning a blind eye and moving on to the next item on the agenda.</p>

      <a text="(The speaker spoke Irish)"/>
      <p sl="en">During the 1980s and 1990s, Guatemala was constantly in the international news. Three decades of conflict and a decade-long peace process ensured that people all over the world, including those here in the European Parliament, remained informed. Colleagues have mentioned some of the stark figures from that period: 200 000 people killed, thousands more displaced, entire villages and communities destroyed forever. The Government’s own investigation confirmed that 93% of all killings were the responsibility of the Government’s own armed forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">The military dictatorship of Rios Montt in the early 1980s was singled out as one of the conflict’s most brutal periods. There was great optimism after the signing of the peace agreements but, ten years later, the reality has changed very little for people in that country, where 80% of the population live in poverty. Ten years on, not only have the perpetrators of the policy of genocide carried out in the 1980s not been prosecuted, they continue to play prominent roles in public life. The victims and survivors of the conflict have received neither adequate financial support nor recognition of their suffering. Indeed, the vast majority of the disappeared have not been found. Many of those displaced have yet to be returned to their original homes.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the demand in the resolution, which seeks the support of the Government of Guatemala, the other Central American governments, the Spanish Government and the Government of the United States, for the European order of detention to be facilitated, with reference to the international order of detention, so that those mentioned in the warrant issued on 7 July 2005 – all of whom are charged with crimes of genocide, including Rios Montt – can be brought to justice.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would also urge Members to be cognisant of the fact that very little has changed for people. For the majority of Guatemalans, conditions today differ little from those of 1996. The peace dispensation promised a demilitarisation of society and much-needed land and tax reform, the aim of which was to build a more just and equal society. Surely today we should remember that, even if Guatemala is not so often in the news, and we should continue to demand and press for an equal and just society.</p>
      <p sl="en">I therefore welcome and stress the resolution’s commitment to the principle of universal justice and the protection of human rights. Our experience in Ireland has taught us that peace can only be built on justice and respect for the rights of all.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Commissioner, it is very sad and shameful to contemplate the fact that, in the vast majority of cases, those who commit despicable and atrocious crimes against humanity, including genocide, remain unpunished. In fact, most of these callous murderers of largely innocent, defenceless civilians never face justice. It is even more shameful that in reality many such vicious sub-human criminals not only escape the arm of the law, but enjoy a high standard of living and important political status.</p>
      <p sl="en">Numerous examples of this disgraceful state of affairs can be found all over the world, throughout history and across most political systems and ideologies, which only goes to prove that, in reality, true administration of justice is a summer night’s dream and a fallacy. We all know it applies to our world, but most of us are too afraid to admit it publicly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The situation in Guatemala’s recent history fully bears out what I have just said. In the period from 1960 to 1996, more than 200 000 people were murdered in state-sponsored violence orchestrated by a notorious army general turned dictator, Efraín Rios Montt, and assisted by a string of infamous top officials and high-ranking military officers. None of these characters was ever punished. Rios Montt remains in politics today as the leader of the Guatemalan Republican Front, one of the nation’s most powerful political parties. He served as President of the National Congress as recently as two years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should of course note that Rios Montt was trained by the United States, and his rise to power was accomplished through CIA involvement and with the full political backing and financial assistance of successive US governments. Honestly, how pathetic can US foreign policy be? Sometimes one wonders. Has the US State Department not had any straight-thinking, sensible people with average IQ working in it over the last few decades?</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge you to support this resolution, which aims at supporting the present attempts by the Guatemalan authorities to bring to justice Rios Montt, as well as a number of other despicable criminals.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the armed conflict in Guatemala lasted for decades, and that period saw terrible crimes committed against humanity, with 200 000 people being murdered, 45 000 taken away from their homes, and some indigenous communities wiped out altogether.</p>
      <p sl="de">The peace agreement will be ten years old in December this year. The Global Agreement on Human Rights has still not yet been put into effect in Guatemala, and the victims of the genocide have received no compensation, whether material or symbolic. The warrant issued by the Spanish Supreme Court in July 2006 for the arrest of Efrain Rios Montt is a sign of hope that the culprits will no longer be allowed to get away unpunished.</p>
      <p sl="de">We call on the Guatemalan authorities to cooperate unconditionally; they must do everything in their power to investigate crimes against humanity, and the country’s ex-dictator and the other seven accused must be arrested and handed over.</p>

    <intervention id="4-216" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Mariann Fischer Boel" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, as Guatemala is preparing to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the signature of the peace accords that put an end to 36 years of civil war, the Commission shares the opinion that everything possible should be done to bring justice to those having suffered human rights violations during the darkest hours of the conflict. In that respect, the Commission takes note of the legal proceedings instituted against former military and political officials for their alleged role at that time. The Commission once again calls upon all parties to wholeheartedly support the quest for truth and justice and to fight impunity where it prevails.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the willingness of the present government, albeit timid, to recognise the state’s responsibility for past violations of human rights and to secure compensation for victims. It furthermore acknowledges the country’s commitment to consolidate the implementation of the peace accords, as confirmed by the Congress in August 2005 with a vote on a framework law establishing procedures and mechanisms to secure the effective attainment of the objectives set ten years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Commission praises the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman and welcomes the establishment in July 2005 of an Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Sadly, however, the country continues to be marred by the impunity characterising not just past but also present crimes. This affects all citizens, including human rights defenders who are notably involved in assisting civil war victims. The government agrees that this situation is not acceptable, but still has to take decisive action to reinforce the rule of law. A European programme is currently offering support to the judiciary, but more public funds and structural reforms will be required if lasting improvements are to be made. The Commission is also eagerly awaiting the establishment of a ‘Commission of Investigation into Armed Groups and Clandestine Security Apparatus’. We hope the Guatemalan Congress will provide the necessary support for this, as well as for the pending ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission believes the European Union should pursue dialogue with Guatemala on key issues relating to the implementation of the peace accords, particularly as the country gears up for the general elections scheduled for the end of 2007. The Constitutional Court has, by the way, recently declared General Rios Montt ineligible for those elections following the coup he led in 1982. The issue of impunity for past and present crimes should be central in this context.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, much has been said in this House concerning the situation in Uzbekistan. The situation is not improving at all. In fact, we are witnessing increasing repression.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The latest Human Right Watch report, published on 3 October 2006, describes the situation in detail. Nobody has yet been called to account for the massacre in Andijan, criticism is still being silenced, and freedom of religion infringed. There is still no cooperation with international institutions with respect to human rights and fundamental rights. Two journalists, Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov, disappeared in Uzbekistan in September. Both men were well known for their independence and for their criticism of the regime. Eventually, Mr Karimov was found in a psychiatric hospital, and Mr Khaidarov in a prison.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the same time, the European Parliament’s strategy should be directed towards assisting Uzbekistan’s return to the community of democratic countries intent on reforming themselves. We must not take any action that could interfere with that course of events.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, unusually for us, sanctions are currently in place against Uzbekistan. Sanctions should be used sparingly and only as a last resort, but we in this House should not be afraid to call for them and indeed to see them implemented, as they are the only real weapon for encouraging internal change within that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important for the EU to speak with one voice and this motion for a resolution seeks to do just that. First, we need to agree on a reality check. In recital C we note the fact that: ‘the Government of Uzbekistan has not addressed the conditions the Council set out when sanctions were applied’. So any moves to lift the sanctions currently in place would be counter-intuitive and bizarre. It would be a bizarre incentive or reward for, in effect, ignoring us.</p>
      <p sl="en">And yet, as we say in recital B, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is expected to consider on 13 November whether it will extend the sanctions adopted last year. We understand there are genuine moves afoot to lift the sanctions. My group disagrees with that and we hope the House will follow us. We believe that the sanctions should be extended and widened, particularly in the light of Uzbekistan’s continued refusal to allow an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would like to see provision in paragraph 2 for the sanctions to be extended, with a targeted visa ban on specific key individuals. That will underline our growing frustration at the lack of progress without any detriment to the Uzbek people themselves.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is important that we keep up the pressure. We hope that the House will not lose its nerve. While I have no doubt that the Commissioner shares our concerns, we hope that she will match our commitment.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important that this House, rather than averting its eyes from violations of human rights anywhere in the world, should take action in response to them, and the dreadful things that happened in Andijan in Uzbekistan in May 2005 were another case in point; we are a democratic institution and, as such, must not allow human rights to be trampled underfoot anywhere in the world. Nor, too, however, must we allow cooperation between this House and other parliaments to put diplomatic relations at risk. When considering the present state of affairs in Uzbekistan, what has gone on there in the past must also be taken into account, and it is on that alone that this resolution must be founded.</p>
      <p sl="de">Last month, the delegation for relations with the countries of Central Asia – of which I am a member – planned to travel to Uzbekistan. That nothing came of this plan was not down to any lack of cooperation on the part of the Uzbek authorities, but rather to the lack of interest in any such trip on the part of sufficient Members of this House. One consequence of this is that we have not been able to form our own impressions of the current state of play in Uzbekistan as regards human rights, democratisation and the establishment of an independent judiciary, and we have been obliged, instead, to rely on information from third parties.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do not misunderstand me: I, too, take the view that human rights and attempts at democratisation often suffer repression in Uzbekistan, and that serious thought must therefore be given to keeping sanctions in place, particularly the embargo on weaponry, but I do not think that extending the sanctions to include such things as the denial of an EU visa to the President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, would do anything to get us closer to what we want. To do such things would amount to breaking off diplomatic relations, and that cannot be what we have in mind. Nothing happening at the present time would justify such a forceful political response, and so I must ask you, as a matter of the greatest urgency, to endorse the amendment I have tabled and vote for its adoption. Should I fail in this attempt at a compromise, I will end up having to vote against the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ‘Reporters without borders’, in their report, now rank Uzbekistan at number 158 – interestingly enough, below such countries as Belarus and Russia. The state of human rights in Uzbekistan has been a frequent topic of debate in this House, particularly after what happened in Andijan. The really hot question now is ‘what will the European Union’s response be?’</p>
      <p sl="de">We have said that, if there are to be sanctions, they have to apply especially to the movement of weapons and troops. It is vitally important that the German military base, at Termes in Uzbekistan, should be closed down, for, if sanctions are not actually to be complied with, a major exception must be made, and so it is for that reason that we see this as the litmus test for our human rights policy, not least here in this House.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is for that reason that we have tabled this amendment to the effect that the German military base in Termes must be closed down. The base is used by all NATO Member States, not least by those that are also Member States of the EU, and must therefore be closed down.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Uzbekistan is an authoritarian republic, previously part of the Soviet Union, which, while struggling for economic and political stability, has been fiercely violating the human rights of its citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The memory of the Andijan massacre in May 2005 is very much alive in our minds today, especially since the numerous requests by the UN, the EU and others for an independent investigation appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Furthermore, despite some recent attempts to improve the human rights situation in the country, the situation relating to civil liberties is still profoundly anachronistic. According to credible NGO human rights watchdogs, such as Amnesty International, the most disturbing human rights violations concern torture, arbitrary arrests and restriction of religious freedom and freedom of speech, with members of religious organisations, journalists, human rights activities and political activists, including members of the banned opposition parties, being the main targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite existing sanctions, the rate and extent of democratic reforms in the country is exceedingly low and distressingly limited. Therefore, in this motion for a resolution we call on the Council not only to renew existing sanctions for a further year but also to expand the sanctions to include EU visa bans and the freezing of assets held in the EU by a number of top officials in the Uzbekistani Government. We do this with regret, but we feel that we have been left with no other option than to be tough in order to be kind.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, little has changed in Uzbekistan since the last European Parliament resolution on the situation in that country and the republics of Central Asia. The Government of Uzbekistan has still not agreed to an independent inquiry into the events that took place on 13 May 2005 in Andijan, where troops sent in by President Karimov crushed a popular uprising. Several hundred people died in that bloodbath, which the government referred to as a terrorist rebellion. Most independent journalists and human rights defenders are being intimidated by the security services and some have been exiled from the country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The recent disappearance of Djamshid Karimov and Ulugbek Khaidarov has caused great concern about the future development of Uzbekistan. Mr Karimov and Mr Khaidarov are said to be the last remaining journalists in the country who have dared to write critically about the government and its leader for the last 17 years. When these two men were located a few days later, one had received a prison sentence for blackmail, and the other had been committed to a psychiatric hospital.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Civil society in Uzbekistan is demanding a more open society, where personal freedoms and human rights are respected. The people of Uzbekistan would also like to see real progress along the road to democracy. The war on terror must be fought without infringing international conventions. It must never serve as a pretext for annihilating the political opposition, riding roughshod over human rights or restricting civil liberties.</p>

      <p sl="pl">By contrast, those countries that sought shelter under Moscow’s protective wings and where governments headed by former Communist leaders remain in power, are giving us cause for alarm and great concern. However, I would like to draw attention to the fact that we tend to discuss individual cases. Today, we are specifically discussing one of the many tragedies that have taken place in Uzbekistan. It is surely time, indeed high time, to draw attention to the fact that the only reason why such events are taking place is because these regimes can count on Moscow’s assent. They are protected by the Russian leadership and are therefore able to act in this way rather than any other. It really is high time we said no to all of this.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Even in a region trampled on by autocratic dictatorships, the Andijan massacre has managed to put Karimov’s Uzbekistan out on its own. The government says that 169 people died, whereas the opposition puts the figure at 745. Regardless of the numbers involved, those responsible needed to be identified and brought to justice. The EU has done this, albeit only partially and half a year late. In November, the Council adopted an arms embargo and other restrictive sanctions. A year on, and how have matters developed?</p>
      <p sl="pt">The repression has worsened, with the work of the NGOs and the journalists having been stifled. In March, the High Commissioner for Refugees was expelled from the country and, worse still, between November and July, in an act of rare hypocrisy, over 250 people were summarily convicted for causing the May massacre, in a series of grotesque, media-circus trials.</p>
      <p sl="pt">All of this demonstrates that it is not only vital that we extend the existing sanctions for a further 12 months, but also that we deepen them by freezing financial transactions and European visas for the main Tashkent torturers, and broaden them to include the ringleader, President Karimov.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is clearly right and necessary to monitor the implementation of human rights, whether one is talking about Tibet, Guatemala or Uzbekistan, because these are inalienable rights in the era of globalisation. In view of the discussions and initiatives promoted and taken forward by the European Parliament, however, I believe that this body would prefer to deal with human rights violations and related problems anywhere in the world except in the territory of the EU itself.</p>
      <p sl="cs">This leaves us completely indifferent, for example, to the appalling situation of the so-called Russian non-citizens in Latvia, child labour and child prostitution in some Member States, the terrible state of the media and the criminalisation and persecution of the Left in the Czech Republic, and the unparalleled growth of poverty and far-right extremism in Germany.</p>
      <p sl="cs">All the more reason, perhaps, to tackle Uzbekistan and Tibet, or perhaps Belarus and China and the like. I would venture to say, however, that the conservative majority is deliberately and cleverly turning Parliament into a kind of tame guard dog that is happy to remain on its own side of the fence and bark at the neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="cs">We should always focus primarily on the problems affecting the EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, firstly, I have to say that I was completely appalled by the statement the representative of the far Left in the European Parliament has just made. The situation in Uzbekistan simply cannot be compared to the situation in any European country. A great many countries certainly do experience problems, but to draw a comparison with the situation in Uzbekistan, where people are dying and being persecuted for their political views, is quite outrageous.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am saddened to discover that, when it comes to discussing issues such as the defence of human rights, there are individuals in this House who break the consensus on the defence and promotion of fundamental European values such as human rights, democracy and freedom of expression. The consensus ought to prevail from the Left to the Right of the House.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I shall support the resolution in which we call for an extension of the sanctions against the regime in Uzbekistan, as the European Union is more than a political body bound together by common economic interests. I firmly believe in the European Union as a community of values and, as such, the Union must set an unequivocal example by condemning all infringements of human rights, regardless of where they take place.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, exactly a year ago we were also debating the situation in Uzbekistan, in the wake of the bloody suppression of a demonstration against President Karimov’s totalitarian regime and its infringement of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Uzbekistan’s independence is also constantly compromised by the bitter struggle for influence between the great powers. In spite of the sanctions imposed, and despite successive Parliament resolutions, human rights defenders continue to be imprisoned and tortured in Uzbekistan. So too are witnesses to the truth, and we all know that truth cannot be suppressed by decisions, laws or prison sentences of any sort.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The heavy hand of the regime is felt not only by representatives of the opposition but also by the whole nation, as it struggles for independence and democratic change. Women are particularly affected. Although they have been granted the right to divorce within the framework of equal opportunities, they very often have to deal with everyday problems on their own, having to provide for their children and families single-handedly. We obviously call for respect for human rights and support for the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, a single minute is simply not enough time to discuss infringements of human rights in Uzbekistan. We can only draw attention to the fact that an independent inquiry into the events in Andijan 18 months ago has yet to take place. These events led the authorities in Tashkent to declare war on independent reporters and defenders of human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">According to the UN, torture is still being used in Uzbekistan. It is true that Islamic extremism is gathering strength in Uzbekistan, but this cannot be used as an excuse for violating human rights. Uzbekistan plays a leading role in Central Asia, which is all the more reason for demanding that it respects the rules for democracy, the rule of law, and human rights.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Several thousand kilometres away from Uzbekistan lies a similar country, which is also unceremoniously violating human rights. This country is Belarus. Visa sanctions have been imposed on both Uzbekistan and Belarus. Extending these sanctions seems to be a sensible decision and deserves our support. Perhaps this so-called visa blackmail will enable Uzbekistan to understand what European standards are all about.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, my being here at all is something I owe to the Uzbek people, for my grandfather – an Austrian soldier in the First World War – was captured by the Russians and it was only thanks to Uzbek hospitality that he survived the cold winter around Tashkent.</p>
      <p sl="de">While we all, I believe, have deep sympathy for the Uzbek people, it is for precisely that reason that we condemn the suppression of human rights there and lament the fact that a regime is in power there that does not in the least meet our standards where human rights are concerned. I would like to see a quite forthright denunciation of these violations of human rights, and I also want to see the sanctions extended.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I regard additional bans on entry of the kind called for in paragraph 2 as worthless. I do not believe we can sort out problems by grovelling to Mr Putin at one summit and perhaps inviting the Chinese President to the next one, while taking it out on the mini-Putins and tinpot tyrants, and so I recommend that we adopt reasonable standards. Extend the sanctions? I say ‘yes’ to that. Denounce human rights violations? ‘Yes’ to that too. But as for spending part of Thursday afternoon imposing travel bans on every Head of State you can think of, well, that, I have to say, I regard as demagogy rather than credible policy-making.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is a matter of common knowledge that, on Thursday afternoons, we impose absolutely nothing. All this House does in response to the various human rights issues around the world is to make demands of one sort or another. By means of this resolution today, we are demanding of the Council that it extend the policy of sanctions and broaden it to include certain areas that have already been discussed. The Government of Uzbekistan still refuses to allow an independent investigation of the deaths in Andijan of the kind repeatedly demanded in the past by several international institutions and still called for by them now. What Uzbekistan should be doing is working towards that sort of independent investigation, together with the OSCE and the UN.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU’s relations with Uzbekistan are a matter of great importance to us, but they must be founded on respect for democracy, for the rule of law and for human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, although one and a half years have passed, the mass killings at Andijan on 13 May 2005 remain fresh in all our memories. The Uzbek authorities have rejected international demands for an independent enquiry and no credible investigation of the killings has taken place. The trials of those persons who took part in the demonstrations that led to the killings have been condemned by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights as patently unfair.</p>
      <p sl="en">Subsequent developments also give little ground for optimism. Torture is reported to remain widespread. No international body has been able to obtain access to refugees returned to Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan refuses to cooperate with United Nations Special Procedures. Civil society and human rights defenders are subject to constant harassment. Indeed, many human rights defenders have been imprisoned.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission has noted with particular concern that several prominent human rights activists have been sentenced to several years’ imprisonment, while Mukhtabar Todjibaeva remains in detention. We are aware of many similar cases.</p>
      <p sl="en">Despite this bleak picture, nothing is to be gained by cutting off all channels of communication with Uzbekistan. As Honourable Members are aware, in response to the Andijan killings, the European Union adopted sanctions against Uzbekistan, namely as mentioned here earlier, an arms embargo, a travel ban for those individuals responsible for the Andijan killings and the suspension of technical meetings with Uzbekistan. A decision whether to prolong or extend the scope of these sanctions must be taken by 14 November.</p>
      <p sl="en">In order to enable Member States to obtain a full and comprehensive picture of the situation in Uzbekistan, a Cooperation Council will be held with Uzbekistan at the beginning of November. Moreover, this Cooperation Council will provide an opportunity for the European Union to raise directly with the Uzbek authorities, at ministerial level, our many concerns on Andijan and its aftermath.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the light of this Cooperation Council, the Member States will take their decision on the possible prolongation or extension of the sanctions.</p>
