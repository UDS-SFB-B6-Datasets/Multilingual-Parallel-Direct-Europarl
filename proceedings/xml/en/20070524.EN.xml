      <p sl="en">Madam President, on a point of order, under our Rules of Procedure, Annex I, Article 2, any Member who has not submitted a declaration of interests has to be reminded of this fact by the President. If he or she continues to fail to do so, this fact is published in the Minutes. It is then stated that, if the Member continues to refuse to submit the declaration, the President shall take action in accordance with Rule 147 to suspend the Member concerned.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see from the Minutes of the sitting on Monday that Mr Herrero-Tejedor and Mr Nattrass, from the UK Independence Party, have still failed to complete their declaration of interests. It is now several months in a row that they have been named and shamed in the Minutes and I would urge the President to take action appropriate to the situation. It undermines the reputation and the credibility of this House.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I am honoured to present the Committee on Foreign Affairs report entitled ‘Kashmir: present situation and future prospects’.</p>
      <p sl="en">This report correctly contrasts the situation between the world’s largest secular democracy which has devolved structures at all levels – India, including Jammu and Kashmir – and Pakistan, which still lacks full implementation of democracy in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and has yet to take steps towards democracy in Gilgit and Baltistan. It also highlights the fact that there is considerable evidence that over many years Pakistan has provided Kashmiri militants with training, weapons, funding and sanctuary and has encouraged militants to commit atrocities on the Indian-administered side. It takes a firm line on human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also constructive as it highlights the common heritage shared by India and Pakistan, exemplified in the ancient culture of Jammu and Kashmir, and recognises and values the pluralism, multiculturalism and multi-faith nature and secular traditions of the peoples of Jammu and Kashmir, which have been kept alive in the Indian part of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is an enlightened and balanced report, which denounces terrorism and those who support terrorism; it promotes a vision of peace, coexistence, friendship and economic integration and commerce between peoples on both sides of the border and in Gilgit and Baltistan along the lines of the European Union model.</p>
      <p sl="en">I urge this House to adopt it in its entirety, with certain amendments, so that an unambiguous message is sent to the disturbers of peace in that part of the world that the international community will not tolerate extremism or terrorism any more and that we respect and uphold the rights and ethnicity of the Kashmiri people.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have with me a strong statement – of this morning – by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Chairperson of the Pakistan People’s Party, in which she welcomes this report for drawing attention to the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people; for reaffirming the EU’s commitment to the settlement of dispute by peaceful means; for taking note of the impact of the earthquake and urging the European Union to help and support the Kashmiris; for supporting the role of the composite peace process in moving towards a durable settlement for the Kashmiris based on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights; for urging the Indian and Pakistan Governments to facilitate the ceasefire on the Line of Control by calling further on militant armed groups to enrol in a disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation process; for encouraging the Pakistan Government to transform the ceasefire in place in Siachin since 2003 into a lasting peace agreement; for urging both governments to allow international human rights organisations immediate and unrestricted access to all parts of the former princely state in order to investigate the human rights situation there; for calling on the Indian Government to put an end to all practices of extrajudicial killings, ‘disappearances’, torture and arbitrary detentions in Jammu and Kashmir; for calling on the Indian and Pakistani authorities to ease restrictions on travel between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad; for urging Pakistan to revisit its concepts of fundamental rights of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of religious practices in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit and Baltistan; for calling for the first-ever elections to be held in Gilgit and Baltistan and for seeking higher democratic representation in the Northern Areas. She firmly supports this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am proud to inform the House that Imran Khan MP, former captain of the Pakistan cricket team and now head of his political party Tehreek-e-Insaaf, today pledged his full support for this report.</p>
      <p sl="en">The plight of the Kashmiri people has been of concern to the international community for nearly 60 years. The European Union strongly supports regional integration, trade liberalisation and economic cooperation. The European Parliament is keenly interested in all aspects of the situation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me draw your attention to the hundreds of young people who demonstrated in favour of this report, calling for the democratic freedoms that we recommend. They were beaten up by the police, their banners and petitions to the UN were destroyed. They demonstrated again. Two hundred of their relatives were kidnapped and have not been heard of since. Subsequently, many thousands of citizens of Azad Jammu and Kashmir have held meetings and pledged their full support for the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">Over the border in Jammu and Kashmir, India continues to be criticised for her large military presence. The report is strong on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, as in the other areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Gilgit and Baltistan, the people are kept in poverty, illiteracy and backwardness.</p>
      <p sl="en">The report makes clear its support for the current peace process. It recognises the ancient and unique heritage of the Kashmiri people. It reflects many principles of the European Union. I earnestly hope that this House will support the report as wholeheartedly during the vote today as it was supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I followed with great interest the very lively debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Kashmir report by Baroness Nicholson. There is much food for thought in this report. It is too comprehensive for me to be able to respond in detail today, but I should like to reflect on some of the issues which it raises.</p>
      <p sl="en">The focus on Kashmir is timely. On the political front, there have been many positive developments, which, for the first time in many years, give some hope that this long-standing issue is getting closer to a solution. Both India and Pakistan have indicated that the Line of Control could become a ‘soft border’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union has expressed its firm support for the reconciliation process between India and Pakistan. But the road is still full of pitfalls. It is encouraging that the composite dialogue process remains on track despite terrorism. I was in Delhi when the terrible attacks on the daily Lahore-Samjhota Express train took place last February.</p>
      <p sl="en">It would indeed be tragic if the peace process could be taken hostage by terrorists. I see no alternative to both countries addressing their differences through dialogue. This will, hopefully, lead eventually to settlement of all bilateral issues. I also feel it is important that the Kashmiris themselves have become more involved in the arrangements for the peace process.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to say a few words about the terrible earthquake that struck Kashmir on the morning of 8 October 2005 and which, as Baroness Nicholson’s report describes, had a devastating impact on the lives of the Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control, especially in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and the North West Frontier Province. I had the opportunity to visit the earthquake-affected areas in person when I visited Pakistan to represent the European Commission at the earthquake reconstruction conference in November that year.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Commission responded to this tragedy by providing humanitarian aid of EUR 48 million and by committing, in December 2005, a EUR 50 million programme on ‘Earthquake Recovery and Reconstruction support to Pakistan’, which covers rehabilitation of education and health facilities in the affected areas, an emergency education programme and community-based livelihood recovery schemes. Thus, we are aiming to do what the report recommends, namely help the most vulnerable and restore economic activities in the affected area.</p>
      <p sl="en">This earthquake response comes in addition to other development programmes in Pakistan under our country strategy. Although the Commission has been quick to react to this challenge, I nevertheless expect that the reconstruction effort will still take a number of years. The Commission’s reconstruction programme will be implemented over a period of five years.</p>
      <p sl="en">As far as the Northern Areas of Pakistan are concerned, the Commission has been active there over many years in developing human resources especially, in improving the public school system and in cooperating with the Aga Khan Education Services. While implementing our programmes there, we have ensured that all communities – and government schools – benefit from project activities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Before I conclude, I would like to thank Baroness Nicholson for the encouraging words she found to recognise the work of the Commission’s delegations in Islamabad and New Delhi. This is much appreciated.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just like to add that I would have loved to have stayed for the whole debate but, as communicated, I have to leave before the end due to long-standing commitments which I could not alter after Parliament’s change to the agenda, but my colleague Mrs Grybauskaitė will take over and stay on in the debate.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the tragic and bloody dispute over the beautiful Himalayan territory of the former princely state of Kashmir between the two great south-Asian countries of India and Pakistan is one of the oldest in the world, going right back to UN Security Council resolutions 39 and 47 of 1948.</p>
      <p sl="de">I strongly support the Nicholson report, and I congratulate the rapporteur on its content and quality, after considerable rebalancing during the committee stage, both in tone and in terms of its approach. The report is accurate and primarily recognises that current ongoing bilateral confidence-building talks between the Indian and Pakistani Governments remain the best strategy to achieve a just and enduring peace between these two nuclear-armed states. My British colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews, who alone voted against it in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, informs me that he will now be supporting the report, which indicates how it has progressed during its various stages.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mercifully, since the agreed ceasefire on 25 November 2003, we are now witnessing one of the most peaceful periods in terms of military action since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war: a ceasefire that has survived serious provocations to the Government of India, including the Mumbai terrorist bombings. Nevertheless, Kashmiri Pandits still continue to claim that cross-border infiltrating terrorists are attempting a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the local Hindu population, albeit it on a vastly reduced scale.</p>
      <p sl="de">Similarly, the report rightly calls for restraint by the Indian military, with full respect by the security forces for human rights, the wellbeing of civilian populations and observance of issued court orders.</p>
      <p sl="de">The report highlights the lack of genuine democracy in Azad Kashmir and, in particular, for the first time, the plight of the inhabitants of Gilgit-Baltistan. There are also general concerns expressed in AJK over a number of issues, including women’s rights and religious minority rights. I, and many colleagues, warmly welcomed in 2005 the launching of a bus service across the line of control between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad allowing divided families to be reunited after nearly 60 years, and it is my hope that, eventually, the borders, including the line of control, will be just a line on the map and become increasingly irrelevant.</p>
      <p sl="de">We in the EU have already proved this with our four freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital. A similar future vision of a south-Asian economic community by 2025 will require free trade across the line of control. Both India and Pakistan, much to their credit, cooperated positively after the October Kashmir earthquake to provide humanitarian aid to thousands of victims and displaced people. But much remains to be done to resettle the displaced populations permanently.</p>
      <p sl="de">The EU’s role, in my opinion, is to support a peaceful settlement of the problem over the former princely state, with the EU willing to act as an honest broker for peace, but only if both sovereign governments ask for our help, as, ultimately, we regard the Kashmir dispute as a bilateral matter.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to repeat my appeal to all parties that support the militants waging a violent Jihad to stop their activities immediately.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, India and Pakistan have waged three wars over the Kashmir region. This very much reminds me of the dispute between Germany and France over the Alsace–Lorraine region – where this sitting is being held. Three wars were waged in this region, too – but Germany and France decided after the Second World War to put an end to the confrontation and make cooperation the maxim of their policy. The successes of this policy can be seen in the European Union today.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament would like to see India and Pakistan, too, moving on from confrontation and making cooperation the maxim of their policy. People in the Kashmir region would benefit tremendously and the whole region would blossom. I believe SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) has the potential to be a similar success story to the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">Naturally, peace thrives best where democracy prevails. In this report, we are very critical of the absence of democracy – the democratic deficits – in the Kashmir region, and also of the many human rights violations. People are suffering on both sides of the Line of Control. All parties involved are called on, therefore, to introduce democracy and respect for human rights there once and for all.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can see that there is a tremendous amount of violence there – consisting of violence within the region and also infiltration from outside – and 80 000 people have lost their lives. There must be an end to the arrival of violent groups in the region from across the border. Naturally, we call on the military, too, to respect human rights. We also call on human rights commissions to penalise, including in court, violations of this kind taking place in both countries. It is unacceptable that people are being kidnapped, tortured and killed with impunity.</p>
      <p sl="de">In our opinion, the EU should support the region’s environmental and economic rehabilitation. Excellent work has been done there in the field of humanitarian aid, as I have been able to see with my own eyes. This commitment must continue. This report is evidently the first in the world to deal with Kashmir. I wish to thank the rapporteur for her courage in including quite a few things in her report. We have been struggling over this for months. I believe that this report will help the people in the region and also assist the India-Pakistan peace process.</p>

      <p sl="hu">First of all, I would like to congratulate Baroness Nicholson for the comprehensive and important report. I know that she was under all sorts of pressures but that she was able to withstand them. I am aware that it is not easy for a British deputy to free herself from domestic political considerations, and that she was successful in doing so. Therefore she deserves all our respect, and I support the report.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The European Union is taking on a serious commitment to repair the damage caused by the earthquake in Kashmir. We have agreed to provide support in the amount of EUR 100 million, and in the coming years will be offering 200 million to Pakistan and 470 million in the form of development aid. This means that we have a moral basis for expressing an opinion on these questions.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We are all very concerned that on both sides of the ‘Line of Control’ serious violations of human rights have taken place. But it is very encouraging that Prime Minister Singh of India has announced a policy of zero tolerance, and over the past few years there have visibly been very positive steps forward in Indian-controlled territory. We expect the same from Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="hu">We also expect Pakistan to take much more decisive action against extremists and terrorists, and not to allow them to drift across the border into Indian-controlled territory. The conflict is not simply a question of boundaries. It cannot be resolved from one day to the next. The first prerequisite for building confidence is for the conflict to be resolved.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Baroness Nicholson’s report shows that real improvement is needed in the current situation. The necessary social and economic conditions must be created. Family reunification must be made possible. Commercial ties need to be fostered, the infrastructure developed, new education institutions established and jobs created. But all this is not enough. It is necessary, but not sufficient. It is important for political dialogue to begin, with the Indian Government, the Pakistani Government and the whole spectrum of Kashmiri political life, with all those authorities that are willing to give up the use of force.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is very important for the Kashmiris to be involved as well in finding a solution to the problem, for there will be no durable solution to the problem in Kashmir as long as freely and democratically elected Kashmiri leaders are unable to take part. In my judgment, India has shown a high degree of flexibility in recent times, and for this reason we expect the same from Pakistan as well, since there are close ties linking us to both countries. Both countries are important partners to us, and it is in our greatest interest that the two countries finally put an end to their conflict in a peaceful, constructive manner, and that in the meantime everything be done in an atmosphere of trust and dialogue.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Baroness Nicholson, for her report. I also wish to thank those Members who helped steer this difficult and very controversial report clearly in the direction of a compromise, and thus helped us all make considerable progress. I do think, however, that we have some way to go in today’s vote before we have a report that – without also attracting censure from India, Pakistan or anyone else – ultimately serves our common aim of helping Kashmir to finally become a region characterised by peace, prosperity, and respect for the environment and human rights. We can make an important contribution to this today, if together we find the willpower and focus on the heart of the matter. This is a report on Kashmir, not one on India or Pakistan. We are perfectly justified in drawing up similar reports.</p>
      <p sl="de">I should like to point out that much of the criticism levelled at India or Pakistan in the report is undoubtedly legitimate – in the case of Pakistan, in particular, much more could have been said. Yet this is not the place for a debate on Pakistan, as we are talking about Kashmir. Since time immemorial, Kashmir has been a bridging point and intersection between the Near East, Central Asia and South Asia. The region, which has even been the subject of a rock song by Led Zeppelin, can once more be a region in which people from all parts of Kashmir can live together in peace and prosperity. Let us contribute to this today. This would be the best contribution we could make towards the fight against terrorism. The region does not need more armed forces; it needs fewer arms, fewer armed forces. Parliament would then send out a signal to India and Pakistan today that they should continue to go down the route of peace; that they should do everything to increase the irrelevance of the border, so that Kashmir may one day be a region of prosperity and peace.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, for a long time, it was Europe that decided how other parts of the world should be governed. One of the effects this had is that all the states in a large part of South Asia were combined into one enormous British colonial empire, some parts of which were governed directly by colonial officials, and some indirectly by the successors of traditional sovereigns who had submitted to the colonial supreme authority.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In 1947, the future of the states formerly ruled by those sovereigns was in the hands of the sovereigns themselves. They were able to join one of the two new states that had gained independence during that year and into which the colonial empire had been carved up: India, which was large and secular and Pakistan, which, while in those days also comprising Bangladesh, was small and Islamic. The earlier states were unable to regain independence and there was no referendum about whether they wanted to join India or Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In most areas, this did not lead to any insuperable problems, for the preference of the sovereign and most inhabitants happened to coincide. Kashmir was the exception to the rule. The people would probably have opted for Pakistan, while the sovereign went for India. This goes some way to explaining the problems of the past 60 years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">India may be the world’s largest democracy, but that democracy is being dealt heavy blows because of the overlap with Indian territory of a large section of Kashmir. Without any majority backing from its inhabitants, Kashmir can be kept under Indian control only by the army and the police.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Democracy there cannot function as it should under such conditions. India, being a secular democracy, has considerable advantages over Pakistan, where religious fanatics and the military have always had far too much influence. It is to precisely those benefits that India can offer that the inhabitants of Kashmir are blind.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the contacts between the European Union and India, instead of sweeping this problem under the carpet, we should draw attention to it, and it was this idea that I found absent from the rapporteur’s original text, which was very much focused on three components: recovery following the earthquake, cementing relations between the European Union and India and more trade and transport as means of improving relations between the leaders of India and Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The people of Kashmir did not, however, have any role in this. Their long-term desire for a referendum about the future, and international support for this, were explicitly omitted, although it now looks like the final result will be more balanced.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the theme of the Kashmir-EU week in early June will be ‘peace building in Kashmir’, and it is an important initiative given the human rights violations in that region, where the need for help on both sides of the border is highlighted not least by the actions of militant groups both in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir and in the Pakistani part Azad Kashmir. It is important that European aid be offered to all victims within Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Humanitarian aid, however, does not involve political interference. The United Nations found out earlier this month how difficult aid operations are to manage in the region, when eighty-three of their staff had to be evacuated because – according to a UN spokesperson – local groups that had not managed to secure reconstruction projects had been pitting the people against them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The rapporteur is also right to note that the European Union has not been asked to act as an external mediator in the Kashmir conflict, although the space given in the report to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is in stark contrast with this view. The EU should not lose sight of the value of international intervention, aid and mediation. It is an omission that this value should be given such scant attention in this report. How do the Council and Commission intend to provide aid to all Kashmiris and the Asian regional partners?</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, it goes without saying that the European Union will need to make a meaningful contribution in order to support the peace process in Kashmir. It is important that the channels of communications between all interested parties are opened, and indeed kept open.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Perhaps I might touch on one of its many aspects, that being the problem of terrorism. It is a fact that many acts of terrorism are committed by groups that either operate from Pakistan, or are supported by it, Lashkar e-Taiba and Hizb ul-Mujahideen being two examples. President Musharraf has on several occasions committed himself to tackling the problem of terrorism, but I am afraid that he has a long way to go yet.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The same can be said of the extreme Islamism that is promoted on a large scale via the notorious schools called madrassas. If Pakistan does not manage to get this problem under control, the peace process is bound to founder in the longer term. This is why the European Union should no longer content itself with promises from Pakistan; it should also expect concrete action.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I warmly welcome this debate this morning. It is the culmination of a long process which started in March 2000 when the House voted overwhelmingly for a factual report on the question of Kashmir. It has thus become not just a British problem, but is seen increasingly as a European one, as our debate this morning shows. We have had vigorous discussions in committee and we now have a more balanced report than when we started out this morning. Some 450 amendments have been tabled, around 180 of those amendments have now been included in this document and so there has been a substantial revision.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are still some areas where I remain unhappy, in particular regarding Amendment 21 which refers to the question of machine-readable Pakistan passports. I understand there is no such concern in AJK. We have to be careful to keep the report factual. There are, however, three amendments in particular to which I would like to draw colleagues’ attention and which I shall be supporting. The first is tabled by Mr Tannock on behalf of my group – and I thank him for having done so – where in order to create an atmosphere of confidence and goodwill it is vital to remove all obstructions and hindrances for all Kashmiris to travel freely in the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, this particularly relates to the financial aspects of the earthquake. We all know what terrible suffering there was. There has been a request for further funds from the Government of Azad Kashmir, but I understand that they have not yet had a full reply, therefore Amendment 41 is asking for a clear reply from the Commission so that we know what we have to do in budgetary terms. The last aspect refers to demilitarisation and that is why we have tabled Amendment 55 together with Mrs Lambert.</p>
      <p sl="en">The article in The Economist of 7 April was very clear and I commend it to the House. It says that there are three fundamental reasons why we should now be pressing for demilitarisation. First, the present numbers are not needed. We now have a process of nearly three years of a ceasefire and the dangers of militancy have significantly decreased. Second, this would be hugely popular in Kashmir where, to quote from The Economist , there is an alienation ‘from Indian rule which runs deep, the withdrawal of the army would be widely seen not as a removal of a protective shield but as a lifting of an oppressive curse’. Third, withdrawing troops from Kashmir would be a great boost to the painstaking rapprochement between India and Pakistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I would like to draw attention, as one or two other colleagues have done, to the work of my colleague Mr Bushill-Matthews. I will be voting in favour of this report because it has a positive message of shining a light on the problems which are faced on a daily basis by the people of Jammu and Kashmir. We should keep that spotlight shining brightly and we should associate everybody possible with the process to find a resolution to the problem for the Kashmiri people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Union’s positive role in dealing with any conflict in the world and our role in relation to Kashmir should be to support peace processes and to uphold international law. Our own Labour amendments to this report concentrated on advancing the withdrawal of troops on both sides, extending development aid, encouraging the practical involvement of the Kashmiri people themselves: balanced, constructive, diplomatic in our approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I was in Kashmir in March at the same time as the Commissioner, I saw an AJK more open than ever before; the Indians willing to talk with the secessionists and both governments optimistic about their composite dialogue and when that bomb on a train from New Delhi to Lahore killed 68 people in February, the politics of blame was replaced by a mutual solidarity to defeat the terrorists who had planted it.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the support the Liberal Democrat rapporteur claims for her report this morning is possible only because at parliamentary committee level we defeated her proposals to cut off trade relations with one side, not the other; to provide economic aid on one side only; to overturn the UN resolution in favour of self-determination; and, most offensive of all, to score political points about the sixth worst earthquake in the history of humanity.</p>
      <p sl="en">I note today the Liberal Democrat Amendment 58 to blame one side for preventing a plebiscite and the Conservative Amendment 5 to resist a plebiscite in the future. Labour and Socialist MEPs will oppose both.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this report, I regret to say we have seen a rapporteur who claimed to uphold the principle of primum non nocere – do no harm – yet she has done only harm. I caution others in this debate and in our vote: do not speak today for India or for Pakistan; speak for Europe, for peace and for human rights and you will do a greater service for the people of Kashmir and for the honour of this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the Commissioner’s comments. In October 2005 the catastrophic earthquake opened the eyes of the world to the desperate plight of the Kashmiri people. This tragedy offered India and Pakistan a window of opportunity to make peace out of disaster. It also gave the international community the prospect of engaging in a previously closed region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council has stressed that India and Pakistan must find a durable settlement for Jammu and Kashmir which takes into account the wishes of all the people of Kashmir. This is a just and responsible approach and one which this House must follow if it is to contribute constructively to the Kashmir debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">As Liberals, whose forefathers shaped the concept, my group’s passion must be self-determination, self-determination and self-determination. It is an absolute right enshrined by the UN and respected and protected by the European Union. It is a democratic process that as a House we have a duty to support.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU must support the positive ideas now coming forward – systems of self-governance, making borders irrelevant, and joint management across the Line of Control. It is not for us to take any options off the table. We must, however, insist that they are explored through full consultation with the Kashmiris and, if the conditions are right, we must support their desire to determine their destiny through a democratic plebiscite. With a history of human rights abuses, a sustainable solution is impossible without ending impunity and ensuring that human rights are the building blocks of peace. India and Pakistan are now both members of the UN Human Rights Council. With membership comes a responsibility to lead.</p>
      <p sl="en">Women and children have born the brunt of the conflict and the earthquake. Women have been widowed and children left orphaned. All are struggling to rebuild their lives. The EU, through its trade and economic relations with both India and Pakistan, must protect the most vulnerable in the short term and secure their livelihoods in the long term. The greatest tragedy of the earthquake was the loss of a whole generation of Kashmiris. We must mourn their deaths. For those who remain, our core goals must be peace, justice and self-determination for the generation of Kashmiris to come.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would agree with everything that my colleague, Mr Karim, has just said and, in particular, that self-determination is of crucial importance – even more so for peoples divided by history.</p>
      <p sl="en">We would agree that the conditions for a plebiscite are not met at present, but they should not be set aside. Hence our Amendments 18 and 56, tabled with colleagues from ALDE Group, are of crucial importance for us.</p>
      <p sl="en">This conflict in Kashmir has brought the world nearer to nuclear conflict than anything else since the 1960s. Therefore, it is hugely important to all of us in this House. Whether our countries have a historical involvement or not, the EU definitely has an interest. We welcome the confidence-building measures. The environment is of common concern to peoples on whatever side of the Line of Control, and can be a valuable peace-builder. We need the normalisation of relations at every level, grass-roots to political, and that softening of the border as an interim measure.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Thank you, Madam President. Throughout the years, the conflict in Kashmir has left thousands of victims in its wake, including thousands of victims torn from their families and thousands of others forced to leave their country to seek a better life elsewhere. Therefore, I believe we can all agree that the time has come for the European Union to do all it can to seek a long-term solution that is devoid of violence - one that is beneficial to all those involved. Surely everyone will accept that after years of insecurity, spilt blood and unfulfilled promises this is no easy task, even though there may seem to be consensus on an official level. Yet, we must ensure that what we have achieved up till now is not lost, and we must also see to it that permanent dialogue between India and Pakistan is given our full support and assistance. Both India and Pakistan must be given the chance to persevere with their confidence-building measures and to continue to allow people to cross control lines. This step was greatly welcomed after so many years of division. I am certain that the European Union will lend all its support to any initiative that could bring about peace, even if this could turn out to be a slow and lengthy process. As the Commissioner said, we must ensure, on a humanitarian basis, that people in refugee camps are provided with all the humanitarian aid they require, especially following the devastating earthquake that left so many people in a desperate plight. Aid has to be increased and the camps that have been in existence for so long must be given some form of official status. I strongly appeal to all Indian and Pakistani authorities to honour their obligations and to bestow upon the Kashmiri population the dignity it deserves, because every single person in the world has a right to such dignity. Last but not least; I believe we need to take action in order to protect the unique history of this people. The Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri population must focus on the factors that bind them together. It is only in this way that the peace process can be successful. Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the work she has put in to making this report a successful one.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to congratulate Baroness Nicholson on her work on what has already become one of the most talked-about reports initiated by this House.</p>
      <p sl="en">When I led a delegation to Pakistan last December, this report was raised with us almost everywhere, and, having followed the progress of the report closely, I do not underestimate the challenges there have been in bringing the basic facts about these issues into the open. I am sure that, in time, it will become an authoritative report on the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">I, too, have visited one part of divided Kashmir and empathise with the plight of the Kashmiri people, especially following the tragic impact of the earthquake. This report has also brought out into the open for the first time the conditions prevailing, not only in Kashmir but also in the northern areas. Whilst in Pakistan, I met many people who expressed a strong desire for greater democracy and a greater voice. Therefore, I hope one outcome of this report will be more democracy and greater democratic structures, especially in Gilgit and Baltistan, in the near future.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the issues that has most divided the Members of this House has been the question of a plebiscite. However, I welcome the consensus that has now developed on this issue in the report, and it is important to remember that the UN resolution that called for a plebiscite to be held clearly stated that it should happen only when the conditions have been met. It is therefore unfortunate that the conditions under which this might happen have not been met so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">Having chaired the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation, and now the Delegation for relations with India, I recognise that this issue has hindered proper development between neighbouring countries and the region as a whole. Therefore, I strongly welcome the confidence-building measures that both India and Pakistan have committed themselves to in the past few years. I urge them to continue along this track with soft borders and more trade, because this has already paid dividends as regards regional prosperity, and I sincerely hope it will eventually lead to improvements on all fronts for the people of Kashmir.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this report is about the present and future prospects for the Kashmiri people and we must not lose sight of that. This report is not about India and it is not about Pakistan. I am pleased that the report was amended substantially in committee. I have, however, sought to amend it further and many of the amendments tabled by my group – though not all – are the ones I hope you can vote for.</p>
      <p sl="en">Amendment 18 calls for the Kashmiri people to exercise their right to self-determination through a plebiscite in the future. This, to my mind, is the bottom line. I believe all people should have a right to determine their own destiny. This is what the Kashmiri people have been calling for for many years. Sixty years ago the resolutions were passed by the UN and they still have not been brought into effect. How can we be so selective about which UN resolutions we adhere to? I would like us, however, to go further and for any plebiscite to have the three options: governed by India, governed by Pakistan or independence. Hence Amendment 57.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another concern I have about this report, although it is now much better than it was, is that it seems to be concentrating a great deal on the shortcomings of the Pakistan Government within Pakistan, rather than taking a balanced approach relating to both India and Pakistan’s failures in Jammu and Kashmir generally.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, we must build on the positive steps taken by both India and Pakistan and not undermine them. However, no solution can be achieved without the Kashmiri people having the final say themselves.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, from the point of view of international human rights organisations, Kashmir has been one of the most volatile places on the map for the last 56 years. The civilian population has been in a difficult situation for many years and has received virtually no aid or protection from the international community. There is almost continuous fighting in Kashmir. Human rights organisations report that, since the Mujahadin insurrection in 1989, over 30 000 civilians have died in Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Kashmir should weigh heavily on our consciences. All European democracies that pride themselves on a tradition of dialogue and freedom, especially concerning matters of faith, seem not to notice or to ignore the tragedy facing the civilian population in Kashmir. The European Union has to take part in spreading and promoting democracy by all possible means, especially in areas which have been affected by armed religious or racial conflict for many years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the moment, in view of the talks that are being held between India and Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and which are, unfortunately, unlikely to end in success, we need the European Union to show a strong will to support the civilian population in Kashmir. We need the European Union to show the same sort of active attitude in supporting the peace process in Asia as it did when it backed the Orange Revolution and supported Aleksander Milinkiewicz by awarding him the Sacharov Prize.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We should not forget that Asia will be the European Union’s most important partner in the future, thanks to its natural resources and manpower. Ignoring conflicts is a sign of ignorance and foolishness, something we cannot afford in the twenty-first century, knowing that weapons of mass destruction may be used in these conflicts.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I wish to thank everyone for the success in finally reaching an acceptable compromise. India, Pakistan and Kashmir do not constitute a traditional issue for me as a Swedish Social Democrat and Member of the European Parliament, but I felt very committed when I read the first draft and heard different parties’ representatives, mainly from the United Kingdom, engage in debate.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Our task is not to live in the past or to adopt a position in favour of, or against, India and Pakistan. We have a responsibility for what is happening in Kashmir and for the human rights situation there. Our task as Members of the European Parliament is to see if we might play a role of some kind and then to offer our support and experience and in that way help resolve the conflict surrounding Kashmir.</p>
      <p sl="sv">What is going on, and has been going on for such a long time, is a scandal. I believe that two civilised countries such as India and Pakistan should be able to take greater shared responsibility, devise a timetable for achieving practical results and, naturally, help each other to combat terrorism. If that does not happen, the United Nations and the European Union will have to intervene more seriously than in the past. The EU’s strategy is to exert pressure via agreements, aid and contacts. I should have liked us to have gone further and been prepared to support a referendum, but I appreciate that we are not yet in a position to do that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Kashmir’s wishes must be our guide in our future work and a guide for all those who wish to accept responsibility for the region. I want to call on everyone to think in terms not of prestige but of peace and in terms not of history but of the present and future. As Mr Leinen said, if France and Germany were able to create peace in Europe and found the EU, I am convinced that India and Pakistan have it within them successfully to bring about freedom and peace in Kashmir.</p>

      <p sl="en">On behalf of the Commission, and replacing my colleague, Commissioner Dimas, who is unable to participate today because of serious health problems, I would like to make a presentation on the situation and to explain why the Commission applied to the Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Polish authorities gave the green light to the construction of the Augustów bypass, which cuts through the unique Rospuda valley in a forested Natura 2000 site, despite the initiation of previous infringement procedures. A letter of formal notice, covering the Augustów bypass among other things, was addressed to Poland on 15 December 2006, while the decision authorising the start of the works was issued by the Polish authorities on 2 and 9 February 2007.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Rospuda valley is the last peat bog system of its kind in Europe. Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that, if the project is executed in its current form, it would be in breach of the directives on birds and habitats. On 28 February 2007, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion on an urgent basis requesting Poland to comply with EC environmental law within a week. Having found the response of the Polish authorities unsatisfactory, the Commission decided on 21 March to refer the case to the Court of Justice. The decision provides for a request for interim measures, which means the suspension of construction works until the judgment of the main case is delivered, in order to avoid irreversible damage to the Natura 2000 site concerned.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, perhaps first we could send our good wishes to Commissioner Dimas and wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, let me say to my Polish friends that this is not an issue which is getting at Poland. There are many Member States who have been subject to pressure from Parliament and the Commission when a development proposal is potentially damaging to the environment.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think in this case, though, we have a serious case which is going to be a test of will of the Commission, of the policy and certainly of this Parliament too. We have irreversible damage in prospect for the habitats of a large number of species from eagles to woodpeckers, to capercaillie, wolves and lynx. I welcome the Commission taking the steps of going to the ECJ and I certainly welcome the subsequent decision to seek a special procedure from the ECJ to make an order urgently requiring Poland to stop the works pending the proper full decision. That is sensible. The ECJ President granted that on 18 April and I hope that is a very strong message to the Polish authorities who are involved with this scheme. But regrettably, it appears that Poland is ignoring that and proceeding, at least in part, with construction works for two of the projects in north-east Poland.</p>
      <p sl="de">So my request to the Commission is to insist that we look seriously at alternative routes, because we believe, and my committee believes, that there are alternatives which would be much better for the environment. We believe that they must be fully explored, they must use the strategic environmental assessment principles and that only if those are complied with should we agree to this road corridor proceeding.</p>
      <p sl="de">I hope the Commission will take that message to her colleague. I hope it will make him better. It will certainly make it better for the Polish environment if we comply with the rules.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, my group supports the Commission in this dispute with the Polish Government.</p>
      <p sl="nl">With its environmental directives, including the Habitat Directive and the Bird Directive, the European Union has made a vital step towards the sustainable development of our continent. The directives are a great success. The areas where they apply often form part of Europe’s Natura 2000 network, which network of protected nature conservation sites located in the Member States is at the heart of the EU’s environmental policy and of the preservation and recovery of biodiversity. They give the protection of nature and the environment an enormous boost.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In some cases, this goes against the local and national grain. Politicians easily yield to pressure on the basis of short-term economic interests, instead of standing up courageously for a clean environment for the sake of future generations.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Needless to say, the Via Baltica is of major economic importance. This is beyond dispute. Moreover, it is essential to open up Northern and Eastern Europe, and to link up the Baltic states with the west of Europe. Increased prosperity and wellbeing in Poland are in the interest of the whole of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This is why billions of euros from the Structural Funds are being invested in that country, and everyone will understand that the residents of the city of Augustov are keen to see the end of the dangerous, noisy traffic pollution caused by lorries.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Traffic will need to be diverted away from the city centre. At what cost, though? The Rospuda valley is a unique area, a special protection zone under the Birds Directive, and it should, on account of its extraordinary value, also fall within the scope of the Habitat Directive. Poland has enormous natural resources, with a landscape of outstanding natural beauty. It is these resources that hold the key to Poland’s economic future.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In the Netherlands, we faced a similar situation not so long ago, with the construction – that was subsequently turned down – of a new motorway cutting across some of the Naardermeer, the Naardermeer being the oldest nature conservation site in our country which falls within the scope of the European Birds Directive. This situation was comparable to the Polish nature conservation area where the Via Baltica is planned.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Commission was right to warn the Polish Government against the construction of this section of the motorway. As a European Member State, Poland has the duty to protect the Rospuda valley, and, whilst it has proposed measures that are intended to compensate for the destruction of part of the nature conservation area, this compensation is inadequate.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The study into possible alternative routes has not been carried out fully. There are other routes conceivable that could prevent irreparable damage being done to the area.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In mid-June, this House’s Committee on Petitions will be sending out an inquiry mission that will be looking into the complaints by Polish citizens who do not want to see the valley destroyed.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Although we will hear all parties and weigh up all arguments, one thing will be paramount: that the Via Baltica should not be allowed to damage one of Europe’s most attractive nature conservation sites. The construction of this road should not contravene European environmental laws which Poland has also signed. Pacta sunt servanda : treaties are there to be complied with.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, we can view the case of the Via Baltica and the Rospuda Valley from two different perspectives which should not be contradictory.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The first point of view is a practical one, involving the people who live there and who use those roads. It is not only Poles who are affected, but also the inhabitants of the Baltic states and Scandinavia. It is a real problem which we cannot ignore. Many people die on these roads. These people have a right to roads that are built to the highest standard possible and they have a right to travel in comfort and safety.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The other issue at stake here is that of the authorities taking responsibility for decisions that they make. It is not true, in spite of attempts to prove to the contrary, that there is no alternative route. There is an alternative. It is possible and practical to implement and needs only the necessary political will. In Poland, this issue has been debated for many years. We, together with a group of Members of the European Parliament, drew attention to this problem last year when we tabled a question to the Commission and appealed to the Polish Government to stop this project from going ahead, as it would be a good idea for the project to already comply with European standards at the planning stage.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The second issue is that of lessons learnt. This is the first case of its kind in Poland, and sets a precedent. We, as Members of the European Parliament, and the European institutions should take care to ensure that, for the good of citizens and in order to improve their safety, all Member States plan their investment projects properly, in line with European Union directives and environmental protection standards.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This can be achieved. There are no contradictions. This lesson has to be very effective. We, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, therefore strongly support a solution that will allow the Via Baltica to be built as soon as possible. However, this solution also needs to quickly lead to a breakthrough based on the fact that it is pointless to insist on bad decisions that damage the environment.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Thank you, Madam President and Mrs Grybauskaitė. First of all, I would like to say that, on becoming acquainted with the history of this section of road, it certainly seems to me, as a Latvian citizen, that it has been known for several years that this stretch of road was going to be built. It is possible that the agreement of the Natura 2000 territories by the previous Polish Government was perhaps not conducted in the best manner. As a result, however, this delay is causing not only residents of Poland to suffer, particularly those in the eastern region, who may use this stretch of road every day, but also three entire European Union Member States — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — and not only citizens travelling to the European Union but also a large section of industry, since 4 500 lorries pass through the town of Augustów daily via this stretch of road. I would really very much like a compromise to be reached that would not further delay the already delayed construction of this road. It worries me that these three Baltic States are in fact not connected with the European Union via a normal, modern highway. These three Baltic States are not connected with the European Union through Poland by rail, since it seems that the Rail Baltica section in this region will encounter the same difficulties in complying with environmental requirements. Nor are these three Baltic States even connected with the European electricity market at the Poland-Lithuania border. So I call on the Commission and all other parties, including the Polish Government, which can reach these decisions within a reasonable length of time, to reflect upon this issue not only from the viewpoint of Poland and Europe’s environmental needs, but also from the point of view of the interests of these three European Union Member States. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, the Polish Government is issuing a challenge to the European Institutions.</p>
      <p sl="es">European environmental legislation must be applied. The directive on natural habitats is there to be applied. The way we deal with this issue will be crucial. We must either take Community law seriously, and take the application and use of European funds for great infrastructures seriously, or the whole thing will gradually become pointless.</p>
      <p sl="es">I have had the pleasure of visiting the beautiful and unique area of the Rospuda Valley, and I can state that this project is absurd. It is also practically impossible from a technical point of view, given the marsh area that it has to cross. At the same time, I can state that there are clear alternatives which are more viable, more economical and which could serve the same purpose as this road.</p>
      <p sl="es">People suffering from lorry traffic in Eastern Poland, in Augustów, are hostages to the political game being played by the Polish Government in relation to other issues. It is a political challenge to the European Commission, which is combined with other political issues. It is the inhabitants of the area and nature that are going to suffer as a result.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, the alternatives to this road which runs through the forest have the support of the preliminary study, the strategic environmental study, carried out by the Scott Wilson consultancy, which is a highly prestigious international consultancy. It is not true, therefore, that the option of this road via the Via Baltica through the Rospuda Valley is the only possibility. Not at all.</p>
      <p sl="es">The seriousness of this Parliament and the seriousness of European environmental legislation is at stake. I hope that the European Commission will stand firm, and that means not sending any more regional funds until Poland realises that being part of the European club means obeying the rules.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, most of the EU Member States that acceded in 2004 and 2007 possess well-developed railway networks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, this railway network has, in the last 15 years, been pared down, and there have been cutbacks also in the maintenance of it. Moreover, in many cases, the old railway companies have not received from the state the compensation they thought they could count on beforehand for their operating shortages, and this has the effect of deterring new enterprises that would otherwise be keen to take part in tenders, and so the likelihood is that the railway network will be used less and less and that rolling stock will become unusable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">These countries once had a huge head start over the west of Europe in the area of rail transport, but it has thus been lost, and their environment is particularly vulnerable too.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fewer tracks does not mean less traffic. In order to channel this traffic elsewhere, all attention is now focused on investments in motorways. Roads like these were around 15 years ago, except that they were limited to the busiest routes, particularly around the big cities. New roads of this sort will now be built very quickly.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In an effort to limit costs, the interests of nature and the landscape are often overlooked. The shortest possible route cutting through areas considered empty is preferred, and there is no money for diversions, tunnels or bridges for wildlife.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Poland is not the first, or only, country to face this problem. The same thing occurred years ago in the Czech Republic, which planned a connection from Prague to Dresden and also in Bulgaria when a link was planned between Sofia and Thessaloniki.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The way in which valuable nature conservation areas are handled does not only make the national, but also international, news, as international nature and environmental organisations draw attention to this. They also point out that the European Union is partly responsible for destroying the environment if it helps to finance bad projects of this kind. I have been urging the European Union to refuse any responsibility in this matter for years.</p>
      <p sl="nl">On 2 July 2002, Commissioner Wallström stated by way of response to my written requests that Poland should adapt its Via Baltica plans. I would remind her that, according to the original plan, the Via Baltica avoided this vulnerable area, but that these plans were subsequently reviewed in a bid to better serve other cities. What the European Union should insist on is a return to the original plan that was drawn up a long time ago.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, it is a good thing that we, despite the urbanisation that goes hand in hand with increasing prosperity, still boast valuable nature conservation areas within the European Union’s borders. These areas form part of the Natura 2000 network, which does something very important by ensuring that nature in the European Union is accorded a protected status, and, for example, by helping to maintain biodiversity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">We approved Mr Adamou’s proposal only this week, in which a stand is made for maintaining biodiversity. Moreover, the Natura 2000 status ensures that the nature conservation areas remain intact for posterity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">At least, that is how it should be. Not every government appears to realise this, as was evident last year. The Polish Government seeks to build the new road, the Via Baltica, right across the Natura 2000 area of the Rospuda Valley.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Along with a delegation of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I have visited the Rospuda valley and was able to see for myself how unique and valuable this Polish nature conservation site is. It is totally beyond me that it is the Polish Environment Minister, no less, who is in favour of this project, even though sound alternatives are available. He, of all people, should surely realise what disastrous effects this project could have.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of compensation for the construction of the road, it is intended to plant a million trees to the north of the region, despite the adverse effects this will have on nature. I know that this is a very sensitive issue in Poland. For traffic safety, it is necessary for the Via Baltica to be in place soon, provided it is tailored to regional circumstances with minimum adverse effects on the environment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am delighted that the Commission has issued warnings to the Polish Government, and that, when it received no response to its demands, it brought the matter before the European Court of Justice. It is to be hoped that the Court’s ruling of 18 April, according to which the Polish Government should stop the compensation measures with immediate effect, will be a message for the future – a message that Member States cannot simply tamper with valuable nature conservation sites.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the planned construction of the Via Baltica has caused a lot of controversy, as have many other trans-European transport routes. Having studied the Commission’s statistics on the subject, it is clear that a number of Member States have considerable problems related to planning infrastructure projects in the areas covered by the Natura 2000 network, namely Austria, Spain and Portugal.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the moment, the Polish Government still wants to continue the construction of the Augustów bypass which will pass through the Rospuda Valley. It argues that the decision regarding the project was made before Poland joined the European Union, when Poland was not bound by the strict requirements of the European Union directives on birds and habitats. The European Commission is accusing Poland of infringing these directives as a result of its investment in the road building project. For Poland, road safety is the argument that speaks in favour of constructing the bypass. However, the environmental criteria that need to be fulfilled in the implementation of this project, seem to have been forgotten.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, in spite of the current situation, we cannot allow talks on the issue of the ring road to stall. The problem has to be solved in the form of a compromise which will be satisfactory for both sides. Both arguments, namely those concerning environmental aspects and road safety, are equally important and will affect hundreds of similar projects in Poland and elsewhere. We should make cooperation mechanisms more efficient at various levels and adapt the regulatory criteria to the current environmental and social situation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, I would appeal for similar requests for debate to be treated equally in the future. To this day, in spite of the support of over 60 Members, no permission has been granted for a debate on the biggest environmental threat resulting from the construction of the North European Gas Pipeline under the Baltic sea. I would like to remind you that over 10% of marine areas are part of the Natura 2000 network and no one, literally no one, has taken this issue up in the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the moment, when important areas of biodiversity are being destroyed before the very eyes of environmentalists and the whole of Europe, there seems to be no will to discuss the issue of the environmental threat to our only internal sea, namely the Baltic.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Polish PSE delegation in the European Parliament has stressed the need for the construction of the Augustów bypass for a long time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, the chosen construction plan for the new road, which will pass through the Rospuda Valley, will certainly have a negative impact on the ecosystem, which is unique in Europe and is located in an area that is protected by the Natura 2000 programme. Allowing the Augustów bypass to pass through the valley will cause irreparable damage to the natural environment, including the destruction of 20 000 trees and the disappearance of extremely rare plants and animal species. Sadly, we need to be aware of the fact that any alternative to the ring road will have an impact on the natural environment in that region. We should opt for the project whose negative impact on the unique fauna and flora in the Rospuda Valley will be as small as possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Representatives of the Law and Justice party, which currently governs Poland, assured us before the elections that the Via Baltica, which includes the Augustów bypass, will avoid the most precious natural areas. Now they are breaking their promise. The Polish authorities have had time to reconsider the location of the bypass. However, they have ignored the environmentalists’ suggestions that changing the route of the motorway would avoid damaging the environment and would save money. The Minister for the Environment did not take advantage of opportunities to reconcile the interests of the residents of Augustów, who are campaigning for a motorway, and those who seek to protect the environment. The Polish Government is ignoring the problematic fact that this investment will be incredibly expensive and will place a large burden on the Polish taxpayers, as the European Union will not contribute to the construction of the road in an area where, according to the habitats directive, it is forbidden to destroy the environment. Moreover, given the European Commission’s negative assessment of the project, further work on the construction of the road may make Poland liable for fines amounting to millions of euros. This will be a burden which Polish taxpayers will have to bear.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my view, Prime Minister Kaczyński’s proposal to hold a local, regional referendum on the Augustów bypass, and its route through the Rospuda Valley, is simply a sign that the Polish Government wants to shirk its responsibility for home affairs and is an unnecessary bone of contention for Polish society. The referendum was held because local government elections were being held in the Podlasie Voivodship at the same time. However, it was obvious from the start that the result of this referendum would not be binding for the European Court of Justice, which is currently dealing with the matter. It is therefore irrelevant and these kinds of activities only serve internal political ends. In addition to this, I would like to point out that, according to Polish legislation, a referendum is only valid if the turnout is over 30% of those eligible to vote. The turnout on Sunday did not exceed this threshold.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The natural environment is one of our greatest treasures, and yet we do not do enough to protect it. I think that the Polish Government should make a real effort to draw up alternative solutions to the problem as soon as possible.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Augustavas bypass should become part of the Via Baltica. This is very important to the city of Augustavas, where about 1.5 million vehicles annually drive through the centre of the city.</p>
      <p sl="lt">The European Commission has appealed to the European Court of Justice against Poland's building of the Augustavas bypass on the Via Baltica, which was commenced before Poland joined the EU. The appeal is based on claims that the environmental protection requirements of the Rospuda Valley, through which the projected viaduct must pass, will be violated. The territory is protected by the Natura 2000 programme.</p>
      <p sl="lt">However, no such environmental protection issues have been raised concerning the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is projected to pass through Natura 2000 territory and which may lead to unpredictable ecological consequences.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Poland is seeking ways of solving the problem, perhaps by building a considerably more expensive tunnel. However, the people of Augustavas want to live quietly. No one is concerned about the residents suffering from pollution.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I have asked the Commission what solution there might be, apart from a prohibition on building the bypass, and what help Poland might get. It was explained to me that in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission is not empowered to dictate concrete solutions to Member States nor to prescribe expenditure.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the natural environment is very important. Indeed, it is one of the most important issues today. The natural world is an independent part of our surroundings. We did not create it and we should certainly protect it.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, protecting the environment cannot become an alibi for certain small groups of environmental activists who resort to blackmailing specific regions and governments. For reasons that are rather more political than environmental, and due to expected material gains, these groups are trying to block the construction of roads, bypasses and airports. A classic example of the misuse of environmental arguments is the campaign against the construction of an airport in Świdniku, near Lublin, in Poland. The colony of marmots is the reason given. However, no mention is made of the fact that this was not their original habitat and that, according to experts, they could be safely relocated to another site.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Similarly dubious arguments are used by environmentalists to argue against other planned investments in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Via Baltica. No mention is made of the fact that a referendum in Poland produced a definite majority in favour of the project in the region where the bypass is supposed to be built.</p>
      <p sl="pl">European environmental regulations cannot be applied automatically, without acknowledging that specific cases exist. We should use our common sense and not be led by ideological feelings. Use of the environment as a scarecrow could be prevented by more investment in infrastructure in the new Member States. Let us not forget that these investments really do influence peoples’ quality of life, and that their right to good quality infrastructure is at least as important as environmental considerations.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, it is true that Poland, which has done a lot since starting its programme of reforms 18 years ago, has unfortunately neglected the building of roads. That is a fact.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We are now quickly trying to make up for lost ground, although this is clearly far from easy. One of the hurdles in our path consists of environmental restrictions. We should bear in mind that when Western Europe was building roads that covered a significant proportion of its territory, no such restrictions existed on the construction of transport networks. Now, a conflict has erupted.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, nature is not mute in this conflict. Various environmental groups speak on behalf of the environment. Indeed, they often speak too loudly, forgetting that man is also an important, if not the most important, part of this ecosystem. Indeed, it is man who needs to be protected, first and foremost.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is regrettable that the conflict surrounding the construction work in the Rospuda Valley has escalated to such an extent and that it has become so complicated, including its political dimension. Is there a way out? Is there a sensible solution which could satisfy both sides? I am afraid that the answer is no and that the Commission has to choose. A decision has to be made.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I personally think that the road should be built. However, permission for the work should include a strict list of conditions that have to be met in order to minimise damage to the environment. This is because, let us admit, losses cannot be avoided. They accompany civilisation, as progress is never free. Everything has its price.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the Via Baltica is most important in terms of increasing cohesion within the European Union. It is important in terms of decreasing the temporal distance separating the Baltic states, namely Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and indirectly also Finland, from the rest of the European Union, by means of access through Poland. The benefits for the Union and for Europe seem to be significant and measurable.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am also aware of the very difficult situation in which the inhabitants of Augustów find themselves, as an increasingly large number of lorries, passenger vehicles and buses continues to pass through the town. Those people cannot continue to live like this. This region of Poland is very rich in natural resources: flora, fauna, lakes, forests and the entire landscape. Any road in this area will have a negative impact on the environment. However, it is simply impossible to avoid this region altogether. The road will give Europeans access to these landscapes and bring them closer, while not building the road will mean that the region will remain an inaccessible fortress.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In spite of the fact that the current Polish Government’s stance has sometimes been less than professional, I would like to ask the Commission to take these aspects into account. It is possible and necessary for the Commission and the Polish Government to effectively seek a solution that will be beneficial to the Union, the citizens and bring relief to both the inhabitants of Augustów and the drivers of the vehicles passing through the area, without causing too much damage to the environment. During the mid-1990s, I was the Minister of Transport in Poland. I supported the project then, as I thought that it was necessary. Today, I continue to support the construction of the Via Baltica.</p>

I would like to take this opportunity to mention the fact that the European Commission has recently become too frequently and unnecessarily involved in matters which fall within the remit of Polish national and local government. That is why we will soon be hearing a lot about the E-19 road.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This begs the question: what does the Commission want? In Poland, people say that it wants to block resources allocated to Poland for the construction of motorways. Perhaps it would be better for the Commission to deal with issues such as GMOs in Europe, as this is the reason why we are facing the threat of an environmental and biological disaster, or perhaps the Schmidt farms, whose increasing pollution of the environment continues to go unpunished. There is much to do and there is no need to interfere with those who are doing an honest job.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the European Commission decided to file a case against Poland at the European Court of Justice because it began to build a section of road that was 1 500 metres longer than the road that is currently used by lorries and five kilometres of which infringes on land protected by the Natura 2000 programme. The current state of the road is so appalling that residents have dubbed it the ‘road of death’. In 2006 alone, 14 people died and 25 were injured on that stretch of road near the small town of Augustów. Postponing the construction of the road by three to five years, as this is the minimum amount of time that the Court will need to deal with the case, and perhaps having to start from scratch with the investment process, may lead to another 40 to 70 deaths.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to mention the noise pollution created by the thousands of lorries which pass through Augustów and the potentially lethal threat of accidents involving lorries transporting dangerous goods through built-up areas.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The habitats directive permits investment in projects on Natura 2000 land in exceptional circumstances, if compensation is offered. Last Sunday, nearly 92% of local residents voted in a referendum in favour of the designated new route. Is this stance on the part of the residents not enough reason to withdraw the case filed at the European Court of Justice?</p>
      <p sl="pl">If the Commission does not decide to withdraw its complaint, it will show that it has not been able to fairly balance the opinions of a small but significant minority in the Directorate-General for the Environment, environmental groups and eco-terrorists, as well as the expectations and needs of the inhabitants, which both the mayor and the Marshall of the Voivodship presented to the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this situation, if the alternative methods for building a bridge across the Rospuda Valley do not satisfy the Commission, a serious conflict may erupt, which threatens to permanently paralyse and block the road that is currently used. In view of how determined the local residents are, and I know that they are because I, unlike the others here, actually live in that area, anything is possible. If the aforementioned road is not going to be built soon, we should perhaps consider opening negotiations with Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, with a view to diverting transit traffic from the Baltic states through these countries.</p>

      <p sl="et">Madam President, as a representative of Estonia, I would like to emphasise the importance of the Via Baltica. Historically, this has, for us, been an important connection with European countries, and it must be developed so that it becomes quick and safe. Today it is neither.</p>
      <p sl="et">This spring, for instance, it took more than 12 hours to get from Tallinn to Warsaw by car, and this is not as it should be. Thus we wholeheartedly welcome the opportunities offered by the Tenth Framework Programme for the construction of the motorway. That being said, a good road does not justify abandoning all environmental requirements. Nor are such roads likely to lead us to a happy future.

      <p sl="pl">However, we cannot ignore the environment and use the need for infrastructural improvements as a way of justifying any decision we make.

If that is the case, then we should focus on bringing forward their implementation, rather than stubbornly sticking to this less than ideal solution.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This problem is stirring up a lot of emotion in Poland. It seems that it would be more sensible to find a solution that is based on facts. The coalition governing Poland has made the issue extremely political. It has even forced a local referendum, which it is difficult to view as anything other than an attempt to use the issue of the route of the Via Baltica for their own purposes as the referendum took place at the same time as the regional elections.

      <p sl="unknown">Ladies and gentlemen, It was on 15 April that I invited Garri Kasparov to come to the European Parliament, at a time when he was being held under arrest for eleven hours, and a member of my staff had other reasons – to do, in fact, with the legacy of Andrej Sakharov – to be in Moscow.

      <p sl="pt">The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international agreement aimed at ensuring that the international trade in certain species of wild fauna and flora does not threaten their survival. 171 countries are signatories to the Convention, including Portugal, which ratified the text of the Convention in December 1980. It entered into force in Portugal in March 1981.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Given the vulnerability of many species, CITES is of acute importance. There are currently 5 000 animals and 28 000 plants protected by CITES including species found on Portuguese territory. The species covered by CITES are divided into three appendices according to the level of protection needed.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The legal trade in animals and plants has for a number of years constituted a serious threat to many species and, although many countries have stepped up the fight, and have become increasingly vigilant, the threat level unfortunately remains high.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As in other kinds of agreement and protection plans for wild species, the success of CITES also depends on the adoption of a balanced approach based on scientific criteria and recommendations by accredited bodies thus ensuring the validity and credibility of its actions and the effective implementation of the agreed recommendations.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The report views innovation as a variable in the internal market. It calls for the liberalisation of the markets and the systematic removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods, services and capital, to freedom of establishment and to the mobility of the workforce, all of which forms part of a capitalist approach based on competition and concentration.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In order to deal with the under-funding of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development, the report follows the trend of providing for the use of structural funds and seeks ‘to promote and strengthen public-private partnerships’, in other words to put public investment at the mercy of private profit.</p>
      <p sl="pt">What is needed is to promote public investment in research, education and innovation, on the basis of sustainable development strategies, in every country. This would help improve the quality of life, create jobs (with rights) and generate (fairly distributed) wealth. What are needed are strategies that oppose the commercialisation of knowledge, education and research and that oppose the idea that only highly profitable research, with market opportunities, can actually take place. What are needed are strategies that promote greater investment in education and training at all levels and that actually make it easier for SMEs to access existing programmes and actions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The report basically highlights the need for a broad innovation strategy in Europe, which would improve the competitiveness of its economy. The innovation strategy should be based on the creation of specialised areas of knowledge, the reform of patent laws and the introduction of tax incentives for companies investing in research and innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In order to make the exchange of knowledge between research institutions and economic entities easier, the rapporteur sees a need to promote specialised areas of knowledge in the Member States, greater trans-border cooperation and more intensive cooperation with experts from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In keeping with the spirit of the report, I would say that the European Institute of Technology should create the necessary conditions for connecting centres of knowledge with companies by means of an emphasis on innovation and efforts to foster competition in economic sectors focusing on innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Another important part of the report is the emphasis it places on the need to reform European patent policy.

      <p sl="pt">There is a long-established idea that close relations between higher education and business can only benefit both parties. There is sometimes a discrepancy, however, between that idea and the reality. The public authorities are often engaged in creating conditions (depending on methods and times) that are conducive to scientific and academic research, but do not always do so – or do not always succeed in doing so – as effectively in the business community.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Support for innovation in the business sphere of course follows different rules and methods from those governing investment in research in the academic sphere. Even so, bearing in mind that a major part of innovation comes directly from business activity and from the quest for responses to what the market is looking for, I feel that this report by Parliament makes a useful contribution to the proposals contained in the Commission communication.

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to explain the way I voted on Mr Gierek’s report on innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">I voted in favour, since the rapporteur has done a difficult and necessary job on an issue that is crucial in terms of achieving the Lisbon objectives, but which we have yet to deal with.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to become an advanced knowledge-based society, not only do we have to be strong on technological research and development, that is to say on our capacity to generate, absorb, assimilate and communicate new knowledge and capacities to society and to companies, but we also have to be strong on the capacity to convert this knowledge into wealth and social well-being. That is innovation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Not all of the EU’s countries are at the same level in terms of the indicators defining a knowledge-based society, nor in terms of innovation efforts. Reducing these differences would benefit everybody.</p>
      <p sl="es">Innovation is probably the only instrument that can enable us, within a reasonable space of time, to achieve such important objectives as:</p>
      <p sl="es">1) Improving the quality and competitiveness of our companies;</p>
      <p sl="es">2) Making economic growth compatible with preserving the environment, and with quality of life and social cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="es">3) Innovation makes it possible to maintain traditional sectors;</p>
      <p sl="es">4) Naturally, innovation can contribute to substantially improving working conditions and also the integration of certain groups, such as disabled people.</p>
      <p sl="es">The most up-to-date economic analyses establish a direct relationship between research, development and innovation efforts and productivity, which is of particular interest to the majority of our countries with economies based on the services sector, for which productivity is perhaps one of their greatest weaknesses.</p>

On the one hand, there are countries who create ‘innovation fronts’, which group together the great majority of the scientific, research and development sectors, while on the other there are the sidelined countries, which can only participate as importers or countries where innovation is diffused. The world leaders in terms of innovation are the USA, Japan and the countries of the European Union, and the competition between these economies provides a stimulus for further innovation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, in the European Union, there has recently appeared a so-called ‘innovation paradox’. Economic results for the Community can be seen as disappointing in view of the opportunities that the single European market offers. The plan to transform the EU into the ‘most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world’” is, on the one hand, a sign of the fact that the Union is aware of the need to fundamentally reform its social and economic system and, on the other hand, a sign of the ambitious and optimistic view that such change is possible.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In the report, the rapporteur very aptly points to the main reasons for this situation in the EU and, above all, highlights the need to develop an effective innovation strategy for Europe.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Today’s recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council concerning the development of a strategic concept for tackling organised crime is an extremely important and welcome piece of news for Europe’s citizens. It is proof that the Union is fulfilling its central role in an area that requires the closest possible international cooperation. Such cooperation is already working extremely well, but it is no longer enough. Terrorism and other forms of organised crime know no boundaries and are also, quite literally, exploiting the benefits of our democratic system. We must therefore weigh up what are the most important values in any given situation: combating crime or unfettered freedom. The time has come for us to cut back on our wonderful unlimited freedom in situations where that freedom prevents us from protecting the most precious thing of all, namely life itself. The time has definitely come to change tack and to remove some internal obstacles, including those which protect illegally acquired economic and financial resources. The Council must provide Europol and Eurojust with greater independence and authority. This is a new strategic task, and it is a responsibility that we have towards the 500 million citizens of the EU.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am happy that Mr Newton Dunn’s own-initiative report has been adopted by a very large majority; for our House is thereby making several recommendations to the Council in respect of the drafting of a strategic concept for combating organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The abolition of internal borders between the Member States belonging to the Schengen area is certainly a major advance for our fellow citizens, but it is also helpful to organised crime, and so the European Union has a particularly important part to play in this area.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One fundamental and urgent requirement is that a policy of prevention be implemented and effective instruments put in place. If there is to be greater trust between states, and between their respective police forces in particular, then a great deal of progress needs to be made, and the countries from which we all come need to be pressed to set aside sufficient budgetary resources for their exchange and training programmes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, this House of ours has highlighted the need not only for victim and witness protection schemes to be reinforced, but also for the promotion of campaigns making public opinion more aware of the traffic in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For all these reasons, I have given the rapporteur my backing and have, in the final vote, cast my vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">I welcome the report by Bill Newton Dunn on tackling organised crime. It is vital that the EU has the necessary tools to promote and strengthen a coordinated strategy to tackle organised crime.

      <p sl="en">I voted for the report on the fight against organised crime presented by Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE, GB) because it will ensure that Europol’s role as a criminal intelligence body is strengthened, allowing it to fulfil its task of providing Member States with information and intelligence leading to more effective results in preventing and combating organised crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU has always played an important role in the fight against organised crime and it is now necessary to provide the Union with a more powerful and ambitious instrument to work more closely with Member States to improve cooperation in order to combat organised crime more effectively.</p>

      <p sl="pt">More than a matter of choice or duty, the need for cooperation when it comes to fighting organised crime is clearly of practical value, as organised crime becomes more sophisticated, better equipped and more efficient in its use of the most up-to-date technology.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As well as the opening up of physical borders arising from the process of EU integration, one must be mindful of the fact that globalisation and its mechanisms also come into play when it comes to crime. As with all technological innovations, it is always open to being used for good deeds and bad. I therefore welcome the overall thrust of this report, which advocates enhanced cooperation and the need for a strategic approach that encompasses this fight and everything connected with it at all stages.</p>
      <p sl="pt">That being said, the recommendation will only prove useful, and be at its most effective, if in addition to passing laws, steps are taken aimed at actually enhancing mutual trust between the institutions responsible for fighting crime in the various Member States. Trust of this kind, which is not always in evidence, has been shown to be vital to the success of this mission.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Union needs to equip itself with the instruments that will enable it to fight more effectively against organised crime, which knows no frontiers and is, lamentably, on the increase.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In view of organised crime’s activities being spread over different areas, the European Union must coordinate and maximise the effect of its actions; while it must be able to respond, it must also put in place a policy of prevention. Putting this strategy in place will make for deeper understanding of problems and will make available the tools with which organised crime can better be fought, and one of our priorities is greater cooperation between the police in criminal matters by means of Europol, Eurojust and OLAF.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A multi-disciplinary approach is of primary importance if we are to find the best possible way to keep organised criminal gangs in check, for we need to dismantle such organisations, bring the criminals in them to justice and deny them the proceeds of their crimes. The fight against money-laundering and weapons trafficking is among Europe’s priorities in this conflict, for these two types of organised crime serve the interests of terrorists.</p>

      <p sl="el">The report uses the existing problem of organised crime as a pretext to promote a harsher policy to restrict fundamental individual rights and strengthen the police state and the uncontrolled action of the repressive mechanisms of the ΕU.</p>
      <p sl="el">Within this framework it proposes: the approximation of the criminal law provisions of the Member States, thereby paving the way for the ‘communitisation’ of criminal law and limiting one of the most important foundations of the national sovereignty of the Member States, the creation of joint investigation teams acting for the repressive mechanisms, the autonomy of Europol and Eurojust and the strengthening of their character and competences, so that they can act as a ‘moving spirit’ in the exercise of the policy of the Member States, the recognition of the fundamental role of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the adoption of an informant mechanism, calling for ‘a formal status for collaborators of justice at European level’.</p>
      <p sl="el">Of course, after all that, it is hardly surprising that the report makes no reference to the link between organised crime and state institutions and the repressive state mechanisms themselves, even though their underground relations are common knowledge.</p>
      <p sl="el">It is clear that, ultimately, the real aim of the report is to ‘combat’ democratic rights and grassroot freedoms, not organised crime.</p>

      <p sl="en">This is not simply an issue for governments but also for the Kashmiri people. I regret that Parliament did not vote to strengthen the commitment to the right of those people for self-determination through a plebiscite. I also regret that we did not strengthen our calls for the demilitarisation of the region. I recognise the role of insurgency but we must acknowledge that the Indian side has one of the highest ratios of military and security personnel to the population of any part of the world. We call for confidence-building measures and greater democracy: democracy cannot flourish in such circumstances. So, I wish the final report had been stronger on these crucial areas but I also recognise that this version now has a political value in EU relations with the peoples concerned.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, first I would like to thank my colleagues who voted for the resolution on Estonia. Today's vote in the European Parliament showed that EU common foreign and defence policy is not just a declaration on paper or a collection of slogans. It showed that it is an operating policy. Today the European Parliament demonstrated something else too; namely, that solidarity in the European Union is alive and an operating principle. It is easy to declare and demonstrate solidarity when there are no problems and everything is fine. However, it is much more important and more complicated to implement solidarity at critical moments, in times of crisis. Today the European Parliament also showed that there is no disjuncture in the European Union between old and new, or large and small European Union Member States, and that there are no important or less important Members whose interests can be sacrificed for the benefit or interests of the large countries.</p>

Added to this provocation is the unacceptable discrimination towards large sections of the Russian-speaking Estonian population, who are refused citizenship by the authorities.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Venezuela we are witnessing the classic phenomenon of the gradual concentration of authoritarian power. The Venezuelan Government often speaks of itself as the promoter of a revolution and we should therefore be asking whether that revolution is leading in a democratic direction or not. Unfortunately it is not.</p>
      <p sl="es">Things are increasingly moving in the opposite direction to freedoms, fundamental rights, pluralism and social harmony. There are other worrying phenomena that I could mention in the political, constitutional, legislative, social and also, recently, military spheres. These events are worrying for all democrats, for the Venezuelan people's friends in the world and also for the large Portuguese community that lives and works in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">We know that the Venezuelans have paid a high price to win democracy over the last fifty years, and we want it to be maintained. We also know that political and social stability is valuable for democracy, freedom and peace.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today we are focussing on the Radio Caracas Televisión case and on the threat that it represents to freedom of expression, a universal fundamental right. I shall not go into details, but it was his Excellency President Chávez who, on 28 December, announced the decision to close down the broadcasts of Radio Caracas , making extremely serious political accusations against it.</p>
      <p sl="es">The competent authority did not issue the administrative act until three months later, on 28 March, and that act does not mention any of the serious accusations that the Venezuelan Embassy in Brussels has also communicated to us. None of these accusations have been brought before a court and the administrative act of the National Telecommunications Council (CONATEL) mentions other intentions involving the creation of a public service channel, in a process which, in our countries, we would consider illegal and arbitrary.</p>
      <p sl="es">The mood has become more heated and we have seen people protesting against this decision in the streets. We also know from the polls that public opinion is against and we know that this is a political case, and, being a political one, it is therefore a bad case.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, an international campaign is being conducted to delegitimise Venezuela, its freely elected President and all its democratic institutions. There is a direct relationship between today’s debate and this international campaign; even the European Parliament is inappropriately debating an issue that is for the Venezuelan national government alone to decide. What is more, our debate focuses on an inappropriate sector, that of human rights violations, when in fact we all know that no human rights have been violated.</p>
      <p sl="it">The reality is that this represents a political move; it is no accident that this agenda item was put forward by a group of MEPs and not by an official European Parliament delegation as some have tried to claim, to be precise, by a group of MEPs who went to Venezuela and met with members of the opposition only.</p>
      <p sl="it">In reality, the non-renewal of the licence for Radio Caracas TV is a matter for the Venezuelan Government alone, and their decision respects the country’s laws and constitution. Radio Caracas TV will be able to transmit via cable, satellite and the Internet, and therefore those who claim that the decision represents an act that is hostile to freedom of expression know this to be a lie. There are a great number of cases in Europe in which frequency licences are not renewed and yet this Parliament has never spoken of human rights violations and curbing freedom of expression.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact is that freedom of expression and pluralism of information and television broadcasts are guaranteed in Venezuela. In the particular case of Radio Caracas TV we are talking about a television station that played an active role in supporting the coup in 2002 and the oil blockade in 2002 and 2003. Any accusations of subversive activities should therefore be made to those who have encouraged the breakdown of Venezuela’s democratic and constitutional regime through a terrorist campaign and by manipulating information, and certainly not to a democratically elected government actively demonstrating its social commitment.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, RCTV is a privately-owned TV station, which has been operating in Venezuela for more than half a century. RCTV’s history is, unfortunately, stigmatised mainly by its alleged controversial role in the April 2002 attempted coup in Venezuela. This is seen as the main reason behind the recent National Telecommunications Commission’s decision, supported by a Supreme Tribunal decision, not to renew RCTV’s broadcast licence.</p>
      <p sl="en">Against this position, one has to set the upholding of the principle of freedom of the press and of media plurality. I admit the situation here is not black and white and the line separating one side of opinion from another is very fine, but only by a tiny margin we consider the freedom of the press prevails and any alleged ill-doing by the RCTV station must be properly substantiated in a court of law.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the non-renewal of the frequency licence for RCTV represents a politically inopportune precedent, insofar as such measures should be restricted to the specific cases laid down by law.</p>
      <p sl="it">At the same time, we refuse to become involved in a campaign that is justified not only by events in Venezuela, but has arisen within a Member State of the European Union, that is to say in Spain, where this idea is actively used. In our opinion, dealing with such matters in an atmosphere of urgency, in a situation in which there is no opportunity for background work on freedom of expression, not only in Venezuela, I might add, but also in various other countries of the European Union, does not enable our Parliament to work on these issues in a credible manner.</p>
      <p sl="it">We cannot divide ourselves into left and right on such subjects, we cannot take a vote in which one side of the Chamber goes one way and the other side goes another. We must send out a positive message that encourages dialogue and does not conjure up phantoms and devils. Although we will not support the resolution, we believe and we hope that approval will be given to a paragraph enabling our competent committees to work together on these issues to achieve a united position that may be of use to the debate in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is not a question of interfering in national affairs, but words like ‘legitimacy’ and ‘illegitimacy’ are not to be bandied about at random. We are talking about a serious topic; we recognise that there is indeed a risk of restriction of freedom in Venezuela, but this does not justify a witch-hunt that is, moreover, unworthy of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, when we speak about freedom of speech and the fact that President Chavez decided not to renew the licence of one of the largest radio and television networks in Venezuela, we should consider in general terms what the limits of freedom are. We agree that freedom is not absolute, that it is restricted for the good of others, that it is limited by moral principles and that it may be restricted by legal principles. Freedom must serve a purpose. The freedom of the press is the very cornerstone of useful freedom.</p>
      <p sl="pl">That is why I am surprised that here, in this Chamber, there are those from the Left, as is often case, who are attempting to justify the fact that freedom can be limited simply because the freedom in question is that of political adversaries. Freedom for us, according to one of the previous speakers, is a good thing, but freedom for our adversaries is not. This kind of freedom is no freedom at all. This is something we have experienced and observed. We lived in a communist state where people said that freedom should exist, but only for us, and not for our adversaries, in keeping with the famous motto that ‘there is no freedom for enemies of freedom’.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Communism fell and it seemed that we would have peace. Meanwhile, it turns out that Communism is like a hydra which springs back to life in various parts of the world and that there are those who defend it even here in this Chamber. They say that Mr Chavez is doing the right thing by silencing those he does not like, as it turns out that those people are also disliked by some of those present here.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Ladies and gentlemen, let us beware of the Left, the extreme Left, which is always prepared to defend all restrictions placed on human rights when it suits their purposes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, dictatorships are not established overnight. They take form through a thousand small subversions of the democratic order – the targeting of opposition leaders, the subversion of the electoral commission, the vitiation of the judiciary, the dissolution of the national assembly and, not least, the silencing of independent media.</p>
      <p sl="de">Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela has something of the feel of Eastern Europe in the late 1940s. There are still elections, there are still opposition parties, there are still free newspapers, but the direction is unmistakable. True, President Chávez has not annulled the electoral process, but then there were elections every four years in the Comecon states throughout the Cold War. There are elections today in most of Mr Chávez’s closest allies – Iran, Byelorussia, Zimbabwe – it is simply that opponents of the regime find it hard to contest those elections, and that is why we should be so alarmed by the harassment and expropriation of Mr Chávez’s critics.</p>
      <p sl="de">Venezuela is not Cuba, at least not yet, but the complacency exhibited by some in this House is at best naive, and at worst shameful. We are witnessing the slow asphyxiation of a once open and liberal polity. If we do nothing else, for heaven’s sake, let us at least register our disapprobation!</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I wish to speak in this House in defence of press freedom: here, in Venezuela and anywhere in the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported a motion for a resolution, basically presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance with certain amendments, and we are still supporting it in this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">We are doing so because there are elections in Venezuela, as previous speakers have said. Mrs Frassoni and I were there representing the European Union during the last elections, and we witnessed a fair election process. There is press freedom in Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is true that it is not good for press freedom to be restricted and we must be concerned about anything of that nature, but we must also acknowledge that the Venezuelan Government is a democratic government and that there are judicial guarantees. Any intervention by us could therefore be interpreted as the European Union interfering in the internal affairs of a country that is in a rather delicate situation.</p>
      <p sl="es">Venezuela is currently split in two and the last thing we should do is contribute to a confrontation amongst Venezuelans. The role of this Parliament and of the European Union must be to act in a friendly manner towards the Venezuelan authorities, society and political forces in order to prevent this conflict from becoming any worse.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, it is true that President Chávez’s economic and social policies are posing a big challenge to powerful interests and there may well be, as Mr Catania maintains, a campaign to delegitimise his government. However, we are not here to discuss the rights and wrongs of his socio-economic policies or indeed the internal politics of Venezuela. This motion for a resolution is an expression of worry about a suppression of pluralism and dissent, and that is our business. It is a shame if the elevation of President Chávez to an icon of anti-globalisation and anti-capitalism blinds some in this House to the drift towards an authoritarian and anti-democratic system. I find myself in rather rare agreement with Mr Hannan.</p>
      <p sl="de">This has happened to the Mayor of my city, London, Mr Livingstone, who belongs to the Labour Party. A year ago he said: ‘For many years people have demanded that social progress and democracy go hand in hand, and that is exactly what is now taking place in Venezuela. … With Chávez the choice is not difficult at all. He is both carrying out a progressive programme and doing so through the mandate of the ballot box.’</p>
      <p sl="de">It is true, as Mr Hannan has said, that there are still elections, but there is an undoubted drift towards autocracy and a suppression of opinions that do not fit with the regime. We had some amusement when six months ago Mr Livingstone went 5000 miles to try to see President Chávez but unfortunately got stranded in Cuba because the President could not find the time to see him. We had a laugh about that. However, it is quite serious when somebody who is democratically elected as the Mayor of, I would say, Europe’s premier city, finds himself wishing to cosy up to someone who is not only populist but increasingly authoritarian. It is because there are breaches of human rights in Venezuela that we have this motion for a resolution.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we have said it before and we must say it again: freedom of expression is not just a fundamental right, but it is also the guarantee of democracy. We must therefore condemn, and combat, any attempt to restrict it or violate it, wherever it takes place.</p>
      <p sl="es">This is precisely what is expressed in the joint resolution presented by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, in which we call essentially for two things: firstly, for the Venezuelan State to guarantee the plurality of the media and non-concentration as a mechanism for promoting freedom of expression; and secondly, we call upon the Venezuelan media, both public and private, to treat information relating to electoral politics in an objective and impartial manner.</p>
      <p sl="es">The resolution also takes note of the Venezuelan Government's statement that it will abide strictly by decisions taken by the judiciary, and we add that all of the parties should do exactly the same thing.</p>
      <p sl="es">I sincerely believe that this is an extremely balanced resolution that is consistent with the principles of freedom of expression and plurality of the media. I can therefore only imagine that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group have presented their alternative proposal for reasons of Spanish domestic politics, not motivated by the fundamental issue that we are discussing but rather by the kind of political opportunism that we have seen on previous occasions in this House.</p>
      <p sl="es">It ignores fundamental facts such as, for example, the fact that the non-renewal of the licence is only for VHF and not for broadcasts by cable, UHF, satellite or Internet.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not a question of deciding whether or not we are in favour of Hugo Chávez: that is not the issue. What we are talking about here is freedom of expression, but let us not indulge in demagoguery please.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present resolution represents a further attempt by the conservative groups to exploit the subject of human rights for their own ends. This is not about the freedom of the media; it is about condemning the Venezuelan Government, one that has repeatedly received an overwhelming majority of the popular vote in democratic elections and is serious about fighting poverty and exploitation in its country – in contrast, of course, to most European governments, who with their neoliberal agenda are making the gulf between the haves and the have-nots ever wider.</p>
      <p sl="de">In fact, it is Europe where the tackling of the power of private media moguls and private media conglomerates, and the establishment of a genuinely democratic media culture, is long overdue. Instead of arrogantly interfering in Venezuelan media politics, therefore, it would be far more appropriate to follow the example of the democratic and social standard of the Bolivian revolution. Europe, too, has alternatives to neoliberalism.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the President of Venezuela, Mr Hugo Chavez, has said that he will not renew the licence of one of the largest private television stations, Radio Caracas TV, which has been broadcasting for 53 years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This move is nothing less than an attack on democracy and freedom of speech, as well as an attempt to undermine the position of private broadcasting companies that are critical of the Venezuelan Government. This decision is unacceptable and goes against all international treaties which Venezuela has signed and which compel it to respect the plurality of the media, not to mention the fact that Articles 57 and 58 of the Venezuelan constitution guarantee the freedom of speech, communication and information. Events taking place in Venezuela are extremely worrying, as they are yet another example of the flagrant abuse of human and civil rights in countries which call themselves democracies, such as Cuba, China or Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The death of Anna Politkovska, a Russian journalist who denounced the Kremlin’s activities in Chechnya, recently shocked the world. The European Union should clearly and emphatically denounce attempts to silence journalists who have dared to criticise the government.

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the superficial interest of the political groups of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Liberals and the Union for Europe of the Nations, to project on the pretext of freedom of expression and through a joint resolution by the European Parliament the groundless, false allegations by the owners of the Radio Caracas TV radio and television station and the reactionary political forces in Venezuela which together played a leading part in the attempted coup in 2002, in the oil embargo in 2003, in the subversive action during the referendum on the dismissal of the president and in the constant, blatant infringements of the rules of freedom of information, is a barefaced and unacceptable action against both the government and the people of Venezuela.</p>
      <p sl="el">Information is a social commodity. 82% of radio and television stations belong to private companies. The spectrum of radio and television frequencies in Venezuela is a social asset that belongs to the people of the country and the legal representative for its management is its government. The government of Venezuela fully applies national and international rules on freedom of information.</p>
      <p sl="el">It takes a great deal of courage for someone to attack the government of Venezuela from this tribune when it is clear that the reasons for the attack lie elsewhere. They basically want to restore the status quo ante in Venezuela, they want the wealth-producing resources in this country and they want the exploitation of the people of Venezuela to continue and the European Parliament and the people of Venezuela themselves will not allow it.</p>

      <p sl="cs">President Hugo Chávez has prevented Radio Caracas Televisión from renewing its license. Tens of thousands of Venezuelan citizens have gone out on to the streets to defend free broadcasting and they are expecting the help of democratic Europe. They are aware that if they lose their broadcasting freedom, what awaits them is the ‘Cuban way’. They are aware that they will soon be prisoners in their own country, just like the Cubans, without independent information, because they are losing the opportunity to decide their affairs through democratic means. Chávez is planning to silence the media and to crush the opposition, which is warning that nationalisation and autocracy are bringing to the country not development, but food rations for poor people on the one hand, and luxury and unlimited power for the communist oligarchy on the other. Venezuela, Cuba and Bolivia: this is a dangerous alliance of autocratic regimes spreading anti-democratic ideologies around Latin America and the Caribbean. Europe will not remain silent. We insist on Venezuela upholding its international obligations on human rights and on maintaining equal rights for independent media outlets.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, my interest in Syrian affairs is common knowledge; I have always taken the view that isolating that country would do no good at the international level and would do nothing to advance peace in the region, and it is for that reason that I am a supporter of the plan for an association agreement, which has been put on ice ever since the assassination of Rafiq Hariri. Commitment to Syria and friendship with it also imply, however, that we do not mince our words when fundamental rights are violated, and that is why I take a critical line on, and indeed denounce, the political repression under which all the opposition, of whatever tendency, currently labour.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Most of the prisoners for whose release we are calling today are people we have met; they are almost friends, and none of them, when speaking with us, talked in terms of recourse to any means other than legal and peaceful ones in democratising the country that they all love passionately. When a country turns on those who love it passionately, when it stifles freedom of expression, it puts itself in danger, and I would not want to see Syria doing that to itself.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Today, we are calling for the release of Michel Kilo, Mahmoud Issa, Suleiman Achmar, Faek El Mir, Aref Dalila, Kamal al-Labwani and Anouar Bunni, who must be set at liberty. I would therefore appreciate it if the Council and the Commission were to pass this message on to the Syrian Government and if that body were to give it a very great deal of attention, for the message is a serious one.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Moreover, it would be good if Syria were to firmly declare itself in favour of there being an international criminal tribunal under Chapter 6 to try Hariri’s assassins; the international community would appreciate such a gesture, which would facilitate an exit from the political stalemate with which Lebanon is struggling, a stalemate that encourages recurrent bloody conflicts and offers forebodings of a period of violence and instability. It is common knowledge that Syria’s adopting such a position, far from being an interference in Lebanese affairs, would, on the contrary, make it possible to break the deadlock and, above all, to put a stop to the rumours that give people cause to think that Syrian could, in an underhand way, frustrate the establishment of such a criminal tribunal.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Syria is a permanently recurring item on our agenda. The European Union is keen to strike up good and intense relations with that country in the framework of the Neighbourhood Policy involving countries around the Mediterranean. The chaos in its neighbour, Iraq, is yet another reason why stability in Syria would be valuable.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Syria, however, is a dictatorship that does not tolerate internal opposition. For Christians and Kurds, it is, to say the least, an unpleasant place to be. Although it is not a theocratic state with sympathies towards Muslim fundamentalism, it does consider Iran – which is a theocratic dictatorship – as an ally.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In Lebanon, it gives its backing to Lebanese and Palestinian Muslim fundamentalists, as long as they help to build up Syrian influence in its small neighbour. Lebanon is considered – albeit wrongly so – as an area that has been cut off from Syria as a result of European intervention. The conflict with Israel is being carefully nourished, because the tension that this brings with it means that the Syrians could well consider the continued existence of the regime as the lesser of two evils.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is no improvement in sight. Both an aggressive attitude towards Syria and friendly relations with this regime are counterproductive. The only thing that can contribute to long-term improvement is support for Syrian refugees and Syrian opponents in prison and in exile.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I would like to finish off by saying that those who have recently become the victims of restrictions on freedom, like Michel Kilo who has been to visit this Parliament before, need our undivided attention.</p>

Scores of arbitrary arrests and detentions of political opposition figures, reformists and human rights and civil society activists have taken place. In addition, documented reports of torture used as a routine and systematic interrogation method of extracting confessions are found in abundance.

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Damascus is one of the oldest cities in the world, and present-day Syria is an ancient cultural area in which several peoples and religions have coexisted – peacefully, for the most part – for centuries, and where close cooperation between Muslims and Christians still exists. Mr Dess and I are particularly involved with the dialogue between these religions, which certainly has a good chance of success in that country – being an Arab country that is not Islamist and is very important throughout the region. All the more regrettable, then, that a regime has established itself there that, under Ba’athist national socialism, is victimising, persecuting and repressing people, subjecting them to show trials and taking political prisoners – and this at a time when our need for Syria’s help in achieving peace in the region is more pressing than ever.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am not one of those who believe in the complete isolation of Syria. The country has an ancient tradition; one that should be harnessed to build peace. Without Syria there can be no peace in the Middle East, no peace in Lebanon and no resolution of the Iraq problem. For this very reason, however, we cannot accept violations of human rights, such as the repression of Kurds and others on the flimsiest grounds, and so we would appeal to Syria to return to a policy of dialogue and cooperation. We are prepared to engage in this, but not with a regime that lacks the fundamental will to respect democracy and the rule of law. It is impossible to conduct a reasonable foreign and security policy and reasonable economic relations with a country that shows contempt for fundamental human rights. This should be a clear signal to Syria, therefore, to change its course and return to the path of cooperation.</p>

The Syrian Government is drastically restricting freedom of speech, assembly and association of any kind. The Syrian authorities continue to pursue a policy of intimidation and imprisonment when dealing with human rights defenders and peaceful critics of the policies of the current government.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Following the Beirut-Damascus declaration, which was signed in May of 2006, and which appealed for improved relations between Lebanon and Syria, the Syrian security forces arrested a dozen or so people for expressing views in this declaration that were different to the those of the Syrian Government. Those arrested included the brilliant writer Michel Kilo and the human rights campaigner Anwar al-Bunni. Thousands of political prisoners remain in prison without ever having been sentenced. The year 2006 passed without the Syrian authorities providing any information on the fate of 17 000 people arrested by the Syrian security forces. They were mainly members of the banned organisation Muslim Brotherhood, Syrian activists arrested in the 1980s and a few hundred Lebanese and Palestinian citizens arrested in Syria and Lebanon by the Syrian security forces, as well as by the Syrian-controlled Lebanese and Palestinian military police.</p>

      <p sl="en">Since our last debate at the June 2006 part-session there have been a few positive developments. I would like to point out that a human rights contact was appointed in January 2007 in the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We also consider it positive that the EU is granted regular access to trials at the High State Security Court, the Military Court and the Criminal Court.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, we regret that none of the promises of political openness have been transformed into action – for instance, the relaxation of the emergency law, the adoption of a multi-party law, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the declaration of the National Council for Human Rights. We also deplore the disproportionate sentences pronounced against prominent civil society activists in recent weeks. We cannot accept that they are jailed only because they have expressed themselves freely.</p>
      <p sl="en">We call again for the release of all political prisoners in Syria. To give an example, all our attempts to help Mr Anwar al-Bunni have led to a dead end. Today Mr al-Bunni was sentenced to five years in prison merely for denouncing torture and poor prison conditions in Syria and fined EUR 1500 for allegedly not respecting Syria’s law when setting up the training centre, also financed by European Funds.</p>
      <p sl="en">For several years the Commission has been supporting the modernisation process in Syria through a range of activities. We have seen very encouraging results in the economic field. We sincerely hope that these will spread to the political sphere. We will continue to encourage Syria to respect this obligation and the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights and Torture.

      <p sl="de">According to the Sudanese Embassy in Brussels, the court quashed the death sentence on grounds of lack of legal assistance. We welcome the quashing of the death sentence if the court really confirms this, and we call on the Sudanese Government to ensure that the two women are not harmed physically or mentally.</p>
      <p sl="de">On 3 May, two 16-year-olds were sentenced to death for murder and robbery. The imposition of the death penalty on young offenders is prohibited under international law. Sudan has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and accordingly committed itself to refraining from executing any persons under 18 years old. The Sudanese Government is called on to lift the death penalty imposed on the two minors and guarantee they are not harmed physically or mentally.</p>
      <p sl="de">We call on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to condemn the death penalty, whipping and all other cruel and degrading punishments.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, this is my first term as a Member of the European Parliament, but I do recall that this is our third debate on the subject of Sudan. In an ideal situation, from the point of view of the Sudanese people, there would be no need for our involvement. I welcome the fact that the six largest political groups in Parliament have come to an agreement on the matter of Sudan, and that we have a joint position. Paradoxically enough, one could say that the suffering and terrible verdicts handed down by the injustice system, I repeat – the injustice system, in that country seem to unite us in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is unacceptable in the twenty-first century for a situation to continue where women are sentenced to death by stoning for adultery or where sixteen year old children are sentenced to death by hanging. Yes, we have become involved in Sudan’s internal affairs. Moreover, we should be involved for moral as well as other reasons. One of these reasons is that we have already earmarked EUR 85 million for humanitarian aid to that country this year alone. That figure was increased two months ago, as it initially stood at EUR 40 millions. We also have to loudly denounce cruel practices, such as the mutilation of young women, which also occurs in that country.</p>
      <p sl="pl">On a personal note, there is no point hiding the fact that there is a debate taking place in my country on the subject of the death penalty. Personally, I am against the death penalty. Events in Sudan confirm my convictions, although the cultural context is, of course, entirely different.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to highlight the fact that we have to show solidarity in this matter. We have to act together, as it is only our solidarity, the solidarity of the whole European Union, that can put an end to these absurd verdicts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Sudan is perhaps best known for the conflict in Darfur, in which human rights abuses have reached gigantic proportions. However, Sudan is also a state where respect for human rights in general is seriously lacking throughout the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">This motion for a resolution reminds us again of the anachronistic and primitive judicial system applicable in Sudan, a system that allows the sentencing of women to death by stoning if found guilty of adultery and the sentencing of children to death. It is truly hard to believe that in the 21st century there are still governments that continue to tolerate and support such extraordinarily barbaric systems.</p>
      <p sl="en">We understand that Sudan is a very poor country, with many political and economic problems, but such problems should not be an excuse for not following a course of common-sense-guided progress towards upholding universal values of justice and democracy. Furthermore, we find it difficult to accept how religion can interfere to such drastic and occasionally sadistic effect in matters of criminal and civil law.</p>
      <p sl="en">We wish to send a strong message to the Sudanese Government that our patience is running out and the limits on our tolerance have long been exceeded. We demand that they implement an urgent revision of their judicial system, taking into consideration international law, UN conventions and respect for the human rights of the Sudanese people. We trust this will be done speedily, in order to avoid having to resort to more drastic persuasive measures.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I fully agree with Mr Matsakis, except on one point. He states that Sudan is a poor country – which is true, but, with its oil wealth and much more, it has the potential to be an extremely rich one. Yet it is being exploited, and international forces and companies have certainly fanned the flames of the war in Darfur and elsewhere to promote their energy interests.</p>
      <p sl="de">Sudan, with its defective political system, is also inflicting infinite harm on itself, however, not only as a result of the conflict between north and south, east and west, Christians and Muslims – as the generalisation always goes – but also as a result of a host of individual conflicts. For this reason, we must insist on respect for fundamental human rights there. As has just been said, rightly, Europe rejects the death penalty. The debate in Poland has been mentioned. As we know, the death penalty is incompatible with membership of the European Union and also of the Council of Europe; but similar standards are having to be developed slowly in Africa, of course. The still fledgling African Union is particularly called upon in this regard to not only develop, but also implement and enforce politically the relevant human rights standards little by little – we know that this cannot be done overnight.</p>
      <p sl="de">For this reason, we appeal to the Sudanese Government to not only discontinue the death penalty – particularly its particularly scandalous use on minors – but also to refrain from a) misinterpreting Sharia law as it is doing, as the barbaric customs practised there have nothing to do with real Sharia law, and b) extending Sharia law to non-Islamic communities. The country must comply with normal civil law that is in line with the human rights standards of the United Nations.</p>

      <p sl="es">Of all the horrors that can be inflicted on a human being, death by stoning is unquestionably one of the most incomprehensible and patently unacceptable.</p>
      <p sl="es">The case we are discussing today, the sentencing to death by stoning of Sadia Idris Fadul and Amouna Abdallah Daldoum, has two equally important dimensions. On the one hand, it obliges us once again to state our opposition to the death penalty as a form of punishment under any circumstances, and, on the other, it brings us face to face with another case of flagrant gender discrimination, since the sentence in question is based on an alleged crime – adultery – that is only classed as such in the case of women, and not in the case of men.</p>
      <p sl="es">It is not sufficient, therefore, to call for compliance with the international legislation regarding the death penalty against minors, nor even to urge all of the countries maintaining that practice to consign it to judicial and political history. In this case, we must also present this situation as one of blatant sexism, or one of selective killings on behalf of a patriarchy, which comes to the same thing.</p>
      <p sl="es">What we are dealing with when it comes to this kind of sentence that only affects women is a situation in which less value is attached to the lives of women compared to those of men. That is not acceptable in Sudan or in any other country of the world.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am therefore delighted with the extremely high degree of consensus on this resolution and I hope that it will contribute not just to putting an end to the death penalty but also to the practice of valuing the lives of men and women differently.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, even in the days when the current state of Sudan was still known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the question was whether this very extensive area with very different peoples should gain independence as one state. A united state would mainly be the state of the Arabic people in the north, the east and the centre, because it would be difficult for the black Islamic people in the east and the black Christian and animistic people in the south to secure an equivalent position.</p>
      <p sl="nl">These areas, which were far less developed, were at a fair distance from the sea and were largely unknown to the international community. Eventually, they were ignored by everyone. After years of war, a compromise appeared to have been struck for the non-Islamic south that had been given self-government and a representation in the central government. As we know, this is not the case for Darfur that is located to the west.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Fundamentalism is a prevailing force among the dominating Arabic people, and particularly among those who wield power and administer justice, with capital punishment, even stoning, for offences including adultery being the worst outward signs of this. The resolution rightly draws attention to international agreements and the need to abolish capital punishment. Sufficient attention must be given to this area, for the situation facing Sudan is a terrible one.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the conflict in Sudan, which has continued for over 50 years, has claimed at least 2 million victims. The breakthrough in one of the bloodiest wars in contemporary Africa came when a peace agreement was signed in Nairobi in 2005. However, the conflict continues in Darfur, in the western part of the country. To date, this conflict has resulted in 400 000 deaths and has displaced 2 million people. The inhabitants of this province are victims of the most serious crisis in the world today. They have no food, water or healthcare. The situation in Darfur has been critical for four years. The European Union has yet to take any effective steps to force the government in Khartoum to stop committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The latest reports on the execution of minors in Sudan is additional confirmation of the fact that this country has, once again, infringed human rights. Although Sudan has signed many international agreements, including the Cotonou agreement, it flagrantly disregards them. We can no longer simply express our concern regarding the situation in Sudan, as European foreign ministers have done for the last three years in nineteen declarations on this issue. The time has come for effective economic sanctions, which would show the Sudanese leaders that their campaign of mass violence against their own citizens has a real price.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four-year war in Darfur gives little hope that human rights will be observed in countries at war.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Although the appropriate documents have been signed, the commitments made have not been honoured.</p>
      <p sl="lt">During the military conflict in Darfur about 200 000 people have perished, and 2.5 million of the province's people have become homeless. The country is rife with chaos and governmental self-indulgence.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I would like to draw attention to the conditions which continue to provoke military conflict and allow for human rights breaches in Sudan.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Whose arms are being used for the fighting in Darfur? According to Amnesty International, arms are being supplied to Darfur by China and Russia, although they deny it and have supported the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the delivery of arms to Darfur.</p>
      <p sl="lt">In addition, China has many energy and raw material interests in Sudan. They come to take profits and, it would appear, the unstable situation is to their advantage.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Resolution of the conflict and rebuilding of human rights in Sudan will depend on the EU’s cooperation with interested parties and international organisations, and their commitments, which these countries are not honouring.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Sudan’s human rights record remains a cause of extreme concern to the European Commission and the EU, especially in consideration of the insecure and extremely volatile situation still existing in marginalised areas such as Darfur. Almost two years after signing the comprehensive peace agreement, the Sudanese Government is falling far short of many of the human rights commitments made under the CPA and the internal interim national constitution, signed by the President of the Republic in July 2005.</p>
      <p sl="en">Within the international community, European efforts to improve civilian protection in Sudan focus simultaneously on both security and political civilian actions. Since 2005 the Commission has funded approximately 35 projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Sudan with a total budget of about EUR 6 million.</p>
      <p sl="en">With regard to the cases of the two women mentioned in Parliament’s resolution, I can assure the honourable Members of Parliament that the European Union and the Commission are following the case very closely. This case was first raised by the heads of missions meeting in the Netherlands in mid-March and it was followed by the EU Troika on 27 March, composed of representatives from Germany, Greece and the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">More recently the EU raised the issue at the last Advisory Council on Human Rights meeting on 16 April. The Court of Appeal ordered that case be returned to the court of origin – the al-Gezira State Court – to be looked into again. Although we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty, the fact that the case has been sent for retrial is at least positive and we hope that the women will be given a fair trial in line with international human rights standards.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last case which we are discussing now is the case of two boys aged 16 years old sentenced to death by hanging. Various Member States and the Commission have raised this issue with the German Embassy and are waiting for the EU Presidency to take the lead on this issue in the days to come. If not, the Commission intends to raise this issue directly in a letter to the Sudanese authorities such as the Minister of Justice and the Advisory Council on Human Rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next meeting of EU-Sudan political dialogue with the Advisory Council on Human Rights will be in early June and this could be a good opportunity to raise this case again.</p>

If the world’s sympathy and our resolutions could bring peace and relief to the people of Sudan it would have arrived long ago. We can continue to call on an unresponsive government in Sudan to change its ways, or we can look at why the support for its intransigence continues. We must cut the lifelines that are fuelling the destruction in Darfur, lifelines like Chinese oil money and Russian weapons. Until we are willing to stand up to these powers our resolutions will remain impotent and ineffective.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, appointing of the President of the World Bank should not be the privilege of the leader of the state with the largest package of shares, which has been the case to date. There was no need to compare the United States candidate to other candidates, or to weigh them up against each other, and there is one man who decides who the US candidate shall be.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Wolfowitz was not the choice of those most closely involved in the World Bank, but the American President, George W. Bush’s, and his alone. To Bush, he was a faithful ally, to others, an accident-prone person who always makes unsuccessful attempts at pursuing the wrong policy.</p>
      <p sl="nl">He was a very controversial man when he took up office in the World Bank and has not really ceased to be one now that he is leaving it. Showing favouritism towards his fiancée was not an inadvertent mistake, but the justification needed to put an end to his headstrong and unacceptable way of going about things. These mistakes should not be repeated when his successor is chosen. A transparent appointment procedure with public hearings for candidates is very much what is called for.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, 60 years after the implementation of the Bretton Woods system, something clearly has to change. Two years after Mr Wolfowitz’s arrival at the World Bank – and we all remember the conditions under which he was appointed and of which the previous speaker reminded us, whereby Mr Wolfowitz was obliged to come and explain himself to EU representatives meeting at Ecofin – it could be said that Europeans made the mistake of being right too early. Two years on, we find ourselves in a situation that has weakened not only the World Bank but also the entire international regulatory system, at a time when we really need it to be equal to its tasks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would urge the EU – and this is the point of the resolution we are proposing – in future to meet its responsibilities in full and prove capable of proposing changes to the Bretton Woods system, in order to enhance the system of nominations, which currently ensures neither the legitimacy, transparency nor credibility of the person in charge of an institution as important as the World Bank. In this regard, the International Monetary Fund, for example, operates a system in which there is a degree of competition between the candidates and a certain amount of publicity, and this strikes me as a more acceptable system. In order to obtain something similar, we need to hold exhaustive negotiations with our US partners, covering all aspects of the issue. We made this point in the resolution we adopted last month and, with this in mind, we call on the current German and forthcoming Portuguese Presidencies to consider proposals that the EU might like to put on the table. For the appointment of Mr Wolfowitz’s successor, Europeans will hopefully have the opportunity to hold a hearing with the selected candidate, prior to that person’s confirmation.</p>

Needless to say, during this fight he had the full backing of President Bush, himself not unaccustomed to shameful behaviour. The Wolfowitz affair may now be over, but the stench associated with the Bush Administration’s corrupt and evil running of the world remains firmly stuck to our nasal smell receptors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us hope and pray that, for the sake of the American people as well as for the rest of the world, soon enough Mr Bush and his warmongering associates will also find their way out of office. In adopting this motion for a resolution, we wish the World Bank good riddance to Mr Wolfowitz, and may better days ensue.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Mr Wolfowitz was appointed to the head of the World Bank, our Parliament, through its Committee on Development, sent an open letter listing in detail all the problems liable to be created by an appointment made in this way, both in terms of governance and therefore the rule of law and from an international point of view.</p>
      <p sl="it">Events have proven that initiative to be right, unfortunately it remained isolated within the European Union, given that neither the Commission nor the members of the Council have ever had a real desire to commit themselves to developing a European position on the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
      <p sl="it">I believe that the next few weeks hold a challenge for us: to demonstrate and try to convince the Member States, but also the Commission, to act on this issue, without pretending that the matter does not concern us; without a European voice, this kind of procedure will remain unchanged.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Paul Wolfowitz is stepping down as President of the World Bank at the end of June. The impetus for his resignation came primarily from Canada and Europe, as we justifiably feared a loss of confidence in the World Bank.</p>
      <p sl="de">The principles of democracy, transparency and accountability of public institutions called for time and again by the outgoing World Bank President must also apply to the operations and decision processes of the World Bank itself. Like many of my fellow Members, I welcome the resignation of Paul Wolfowitz, a leading neoconservative and one of the main proponents of the war in Iraq. Like many others, I regret that this decision is somewhat belated.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, today’s discussion and resolution do not concern only Paul Wolfowitz personally. What is more important is to avoid making the same mistakes in future and to seek much better selection procedures. We would ask the German and Portuguese Presidencies to present proposals on behalf of the Union for making the selection of executives of the Bretton Woods Institutions more democratic, more transparent and more responsible in future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the resolution talks about the Wolfowitz affair in terms of ‘the World Bank’s failure to live up to the globally shared standards of transparency and democracy’. What utter humbug! Any standards of transparency and democracy in the world are practised on a strictly limited basis, and the European Union hardly sets an example.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Wolfowitz has been hounded out of office by those opposed to his anti-corruption agenda. The worst thing that the executive directors of the Bank could find to say against him was that ‘a number of mistakes were made’. If Mr Wolfowitz’s worst offence was giving his girlfriend a job, then it would hardly qualify as a minor error of judgement compared to the legendary levels of nepotism and corruption that the European Union has been guilty of over the years and the usual levels of corruption associated with the World Bank. Mr Wolfowitz wanted to clean it up and now he will not be able to, but it is an ill wind that cannot be used by the European Union to its advantage.</p>
      <p sl="de">This brings me to paragraph 6 of the resolution that calls for the Commission to have observer status at the Bank and for it to attend and intervene at certain councils. The key phrase here is ‘pending legal personality for the Union’. That legal personality depends on the ratification of the European Constitution that the European Union intends to stuff down the throats of the peoples of Europe whether they want it or not.</p>
      <p sl="de">President Bush should nominate a new head of the World Bank whose girlfriend or boyfriend already has a job and who will either clean it up or close it down, and he should make sure that the European Union is let nowhere near it in the meantime!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission understands the European Parliament’s concerns about the situation at the World Bank before Mr Wolfowitz’s resignation. However, unlike the Member States, the Commission is not a shareholder in the Bank; it is not a member of the Board of Directors and can only take note of Mr Wolfowitz’s decision to resign.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission calls on the Bank and its members to begin discussions to designate a successor to ensure continuity and stability in the leadership of the Bank. The World Bank plays a crucial role in development. The Commission looks forward to a continuing strong role for the World Bank and to continuing its good cooperation with this institution in development efforts.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Before I close the debate, I should like to make the following statement.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I understand why Members of this Chamber were surprised and perplexed to see that we had four points for this afternoon’s debate instead of three, as laid down by the Rules of Procedure. What happened was something of a divergence between two entirely legitimate perspectives: namely, what is laid down in the Rules of Procedure and what Monday’s Conference of Presidents was seeking, which was validated in plenary.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I therefore call on the President of Parliament to ensure that the Chair will never again be faced with such a problem. The Chair had to do his best to respond to the Chamber’s astonishment, which is understandable given the conflict we have seen today between two sources of legitimacy.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Please do not think that your points of view have gone unheard. They will be followed up, and the necessary conclusions will be drawn.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The debate is closed.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates, that is to say right now.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, please note that I find the number of MEPs present needed to oppose the oral amendment utterly preposterous this Thursday afternoon. Indeed, more people than the total number here in the Chamber are needed to vote against. I am not sure there are even 40 people here in favour of this oral amendment. I cannot oppose the oral amendment itself, but I am firmly opposed to the procedure. I should like you to take note of this.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Let me remind you of the rule. The number of people required to oppose the adoption of an oral amendment is always the same regardless of when we vote and of the time, the day and the place of the vote. To propose an amendment, however, requires just one single MEP.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">You can call for a quorum, but there is a procedure, a different procedure, for that. Yet if you ask to verify the quorum and the quorum has not been reached, I should like to remind you that this vote will not be adjourned because it is an emergency vote. The text will lapse, and there will not be a vote on it. That is the rule.</p>
