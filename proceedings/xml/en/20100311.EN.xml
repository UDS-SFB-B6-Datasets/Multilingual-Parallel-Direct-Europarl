      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Council and Commission (O-0015/2010 – B7-0011/2010) by Herbert Reul on Investing in the Development of Low Carbon Technologies</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-007" speaker_id="28225" name="Herbert Reul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, this question relates to the fact that, in 2007, the Commission brought forward a plan with the objective of promoting technologies in the field of energy with low CO2 emissions so that they could come into use quickly. Proposals were made for very specific measures: European industrial initiatives, above all in the fields of wind energy, solar energy, bio-energy, carbon capture and storage, electricity grids and nuclear fission, the creation of a European Energy Research Alliance, the sustainable conversion of European energy infrastructure networks, constantly updated European energy technology systems and the establishment of a steering group on strategic energy technologies.</p>
      <p sl="de">At that stage, one crucial question was left unanswered, namely the issue of funding. The Seventh Framework Programme for Research provides for EUR 886 million per annum for energy research. It is clear to all, however, that that is not enough. In 2009, the Commission brought out its communication on the funding of low-carbon energy technologies, in which it described the need to treble the funding for energy research over the next 10 years. That would mean that EUR 50 billion would have to be invested. The communication described how the money for the most important low-carbon technologies should be apportioned so that Europe can move away from its heavy dependence on fossil fuels to a stronger reduction in CO2 emissions. The final plan estimates EUR 6 billion for research into wind energy, which, according to the Commission, could make up a fifth of EU energy provision by 2020; EUR 16 billion for solar energy, in order to develop new photovoltaic concepts and a major industrial concentration of solar energy facilities; EUR 9 billion for bio-energy research, in order to cover 14% of the EU’s energy needs. In order to integrate renewable energy sources into the energy market, electricity grids would receive EUR 2 billion so that half of the grid would be able to operate on the basis of a ‘smart grid’ principle. Apart from renewable energy sources, a further EUR 13 billion is envisaged for up to 12 projects in the field of carbon capture and storage, while nuclear research would receive EUR 7 billion. The funding proposal also envisaged a further EUR 11 billion for the ‘smart cities’ programme so that appropriate answers can be found in this field, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">The Commission suggested at the time that public-private partnerships are the most credible way of funding energy research but was unable to spell out precisely how the funding burdens in such arrangements would be split between the two sides. At present, the split in the field of energy research is 70% private and 30% public, excluding nuclear research. The EU argues that there is a need for a significant increase in public funding. In projects in which the risks are higher, public funding should play a major role, the Commission stated. In order to optimise the level of the intervention, the Commission called for the institution of EU programmes particularly in areas where there is a clear added value at EU level, such as where programmes are too expensive for the Member States individually. At present, 80% of public investment in non-nuclear energy research is funded at national level. This communication, too, ultimately leaves open the question of where the money is to come from. The Commission calculates that there is a need for an extra EUR 75 to 80 billion.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is the reason why we concentrated, in our committee, on obtaining a little more clarity on a few issues in this area of funding. I would like to just remind you of the questions. Firstly, how does the Commission intend to set its priorities for the 2010-2020 roadmap to support the financing of low-carbon technologies? When will industrial policy initiatives to that effect be introduced? Secondly, how does the Commission intend to make additional EU budget resources available? How, specifically, is the Commission committed to ensuring that funds will start flowing in advance of resources from the Eighth Framework Programme? Will the Commission ensure that the budgets identified for the various industrial initiatives will be respected? Last but not least, how will the Commission – and, of course, this will also always apply to the Council – make additional funding from the EU budget available for the funding of technological options other than those specified in the communication, including storage technologies, ocean energies and so on. There is no need for me to read out all the questions. We have introduced the questions here, and we ask for answers from the Council and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech by stressing the importance of the strategic energy plan and the necessary contribution it will make to speeding up the development and application of technologies for clean, sustainable and efficient energy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Without this plan, it will not be possible to achieve the goals we have set for 2020, nor to carry out the transition to a low-carbon economy on the scale we would like for 2050.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am pleased to see that there is broad consensus between Parliament and the Council with regard to the importance and necessity of both the objectives of the plan and the resources that need to be made available.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council intends to adopt conclusions on the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan in its meeting this coming Friday 12 March. These conclusions will be an important point of reference for the spring European Council meeting to be held on 25 March, since the subject of climate change will feature on the agenda.</p>
      <p sl="es">The draft conclusions to be debated at the Council meeting will include the subject of financing, although this matter will be approached with due caution. We do not want to preempt the negotiations that will have to take place on this subject within the context of the next financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">I will now set out the main elements of the draft conclusions. Firstly, the time has come to move from technological roadmaps to the operational implementation of European industrial initiatives. We should do so step by step, but as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, our approach to future cooperation in energy research within Europe should focus on using public resources effectively and building flexible, public-private partnerships with industry. We therefore urge the Commission to establish a platform that includes all of the interested financial organisations so that they can share information and best practices and, at the same time, coordinate their actions as deemed necessary.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, given the scale of medium-term public-private financing needed in order to support major demonstration projects in particular, it may be necessary to increase the proportion of public investment at EU level. We will therefore need to take that into account both when revising the budget and when negotiating for the next financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fourthly, we should support the governments of the Member States and encourage them to give adequate incentives and consistent signals in order for this policy to be implemented. If necessary, they should also make significant increases to public financing for the development of low-carbon technologies.</p>
      <p sl="es">The fifth point to mention is that the European Commission and the European Investment Bank are already working together to improve the coordination and continuity of financing for demonstration projects in the sector of energy involving high technological risk. They are also working to mobilise and make available other sources of financing, both public and private.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the Commission and the European Investment Bank are looking into optimum financial packages for major demonstration projects, and so we also urge the Commission to analyse new ways of combining resources from different sources and to develop an ad hoc tool for financing the commercial launch of low-carbon technologies.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, all of these elements constitute a clear message on future investment for the development of low-carbon technologies. Despite the severe budgetary restrictions we currently face, the message that the Council will send out in its meeting on Friday will be one of commitment, using positive terms to express the significance of this matter at European level and the vital importance for each Member State to invest in low-carbon technology.</p>

    <intervention id="4-009" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, although I am replacing my colleague Günther Oettinger today, it is a real pleasure to discuss with you the future of low-carbon technologies.</p>
      <p sl="en">I personally was closely involved in the development of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) in the last Commission and I believe strongly that the development of these technologies is one of the cornerstones of the energy policy we have to develop jointly in the years to come.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament’s report on the SET Plan of June 2008 was very clear in proposing an appropriate level of ambition. We should not now lower this ambition. Today you have asked three clear questions and I will respond to them in turn.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, regarding our priorities for 2010 to 2020 and the launch of the European industrial initiatives, those six initiatives really match our priorities – wind, solar bio-energy, sustainable fission, smart grids, and carbon capture and storage are priorities that were strongly endorsed by Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">At your request, we have also prioritised energy efficiency by developing a new dedicated initiative – ‘Smart Cities’ – to unlock the market potential of energy efficient technologies in cities and regions. To prioritise activities within this initiative, the Commission has developed, together with the stakeholders, technology road maps for the period 2010-2020. These road maps establish concrete objectives as well as the activities needed to achieve them. The initiatives are mature for launching this year, 2010. Smart Cities are planned for the following year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Your second question concerns the need for predictable, stable and adequate budgets for the SET Plan in the current financing period and post-2014. Our estimate of the public and private investment needs for the development of low-carbon technologies in the SET Plan is EUR 8 billion per year. Today about EUR 3 billion are being invested annually in the European Union, which means that a further EUR 50 billion is needed for the period 2010-2020. Bridging this gap should be one of the key institutional discussions over the coming years. Effort must be focused where intervention is most efficient, avoiding duplications and fostering the greatest potential impact in the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is clear that EU level investments – coming either from the Seventh Framework Programme or the European Energy Programme for Recovery – will not be enough. Nor will the potential funds from the 300 million emissions trading allowances set aside for the demonstration of carbon capture and storage and innovative renewable technologies. At current prices this is approximately EUR 4 billion. Major efforts are therefore required, both by the private and public sector; the public sector includes both the European Union and of course also the Member States. To be blunt, the bulk of the money will have to come from where the bulk of the money is.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, you asked if the Commission intends to finance other technology avenues and propose additional industrial initiatives. Other technologies that deserve European-level intervention will certainly emerge over time, so the SET Plan must remain flexible, as we have already shown with the new initiative on energy efficiency – Smart Cities – which we expect to launch, as I said, in 2011. We will closely monitor the most promising technologies through the SET Plan information system. SETIS, as this is called, is already working on storage and ocean technologies to assess their potential and identify the best opportunities for European intervention. We have also encouraged the establishment of a new technology platform on renewables, heating and cooling, that should help the sectors involved better to define their technology transfer.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am very pleased to see this file getting the support it deserves. It is a key file for achieving our energy policy goals, a key file for Europe and for our future.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I am delighted to see you back here, Mr Potočnik, in your post as Commissioner for the Environment. You are standing in for our Commissioner for Industry – thank you for that, and thank you also for your speech.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the question put by my colleague, Mr Reul, who is right, Commissioner, to question you on how the Commission views this crucial issue of non-carbon energies and of the financing of new technologies. The world’s population is growing. We will need 40% more energy in 2030, and I would add that 80% of this consumer demand will come from countries outside the OECD.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the face of these major challenges, the solution is not to adopt the ideology of decreasing our energy use or to take refuge in thoughts of the past. The European Union therefore has a duty to intervene, and I would like to say a word about an issue that may divide us, within our political groups, and that is nuclear energy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">When it comes to nuclear energy, we have Member States that have a long tradition in these matters. That does not make the European Union privileged, but it does mean that we have a duty to contribute to the debate and to the financing. Nuclear energy, as we know, is a non-carbon energy, and we need financing, Commissioner, and particularly that accrued from carbon credits, to invest in research, development and training on all these areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are proposing some amendments to you with the specific aim of improving the resolutions that have been tabled, and I will conclude by saying a word about nuclear by-products, which are a source of great concern for our fellow citizens. There are two options in the world: long-term storage, which is the United States’ chosen option, and we, the European Union, have to choose a different approach, which is recovery by means of recycling. That is the option chosen by Russia, Japan and France.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is in this context that we who are responsible for safety and security must put our faith in science and in knowledge where all these subjects are concerned.</p>

    <intervention id="4-011" speaker_id="28349" name="Teresa Riera Madurell" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the S&amp;D Group">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Secretary of State and President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are all aware that there is already clear consensus over the idea that the faster we establish a green economy, the faster we will emerge from the economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="es">A number of studies have calculated that if we achieve the goal of a 20% share of renewable energy sources, it will mean that 2.8 million European workers will be employed in the sector by 2020. Furthermore, it is estimated that two thirds of the new jobs will be created within small and medium-sized enterprises. The key to this, ladies and gentlemen, lies in the development of green technologies.</p>
      <p sl="es">In order to make this a reality, my Group is in favour of three main objectives. Firstly, we need a real commitment to earmarking resources for the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan. It is not enough to simply regroup and rename the support programmes we already have. We agree that we need to transform our goal into a real increase in the resources devoted to research into renewable energy and energy efficiency. We should do so straight away, in the next review of the financial perspectives and, of course, in negotiations over the new financial perspectives.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, if we want to create the jobs our economy needs in order to emerge from the crisis, it is vital that we boost the demonstration stage of innovative technologies and make it easier for them to be put into operation in the market.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the potential creation of green employment cannot be steered in the right direction if we do not have a highly qualified workforce. We need to invest in education and awareness in order to strengthen the ties between the business world and the academic world, and we should promote qualifications of excellence in research and development and in innovation so as to be able to cover any potential gaps in the renewable energies job markets.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, we can set all the targets under the sun for tackling climate change but we will not reach them, especially the longer-term targets for 2050, unless we invest deeply and systematically in developing and improving sustainable low-carbon technology.</p>
      <p sl="de">The US is rightly criticised for its failure to sign up to greenhouse gas reduction targets, but the EU is nowhere near the level of investment that the US is at at present. Without proper investment, the EU’s sustainable low-carbon investment programme will stall, and that means that hundreds of thousands of jobs which could be created here in the EU, and in regions like my own, the North-East of England, which are already starting to make that transformation to a low-carbon economy, without investment those jobs will go elsewhere to the US and China.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am disappointed that the Commission drew back from an earlier draft of the SET Plan, where the sources of the identified necessary investment were clearly indicated. Will the Commission now be more explicit, especially about the EUR 1 billion per annum shortfall that the Commissioner has just mentioned?</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, it is, of course, important to achieve improvements in nuclear technology, especially with regard to safety of operation and waste management, but my Group takes the view that ‘sustainable nuclear fission’ is a contradiction in terms. Will the Commissioner rename the sixth European industrial initiative simply the ‘nuclear energy initiative’?</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-013" speaker_id="4432" name="Claude Turmes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I think this SET Plan is basically an empty box because there is no money behind it. We really have to think about where the money could come from. What is worse is that the instruments the Commission had – the NER300, the Recovery Plan and certain funds available today at the European Investment Bank – are more prioritised for those so-called low-carbon technologies that are the least efficient and present the highest risk.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2008 and 2009, more than 70% of all investments on the market in Europe were already in renewables: wind, solar, biomass. So how can it be that we are designing a SET Plan – and earmarking money at EU level – that basically gives a lower share to renewables than the market is already uptaking today, while diverting the money to carbon sequestration and to nuclear fusion, which is not addressed in this paper but which receives by far the largest share of EU money?</p>
      <p sl="en">Our problem is that, because of certain lobbies, we do not have the courage to set the right priorities, and I think that even the IEA, which is not a green grass-root organisation, is extremely clear about the priorities. Fifty-five per cent of all CO2 reductions will come from energy efficiency. Why did we allocate zero euro to energy efficiency in the EU recovery package? Thirty to thirty-five per cent of CO2 greenhouse gas reductions will come from renewables, while at best only 10% will come from carbon sequestration and 10% from nuclear. That is according to the IEA, not a green grass-root organisation. So, even in Europe, in terms of how we allocate money we are behind what the IEA is telling governments.</p>
      <p sl="en">The only way out is to set clear priorities. Number one: energy efficiency; number two: renewables, because they reduce carbon without posing a risk; and then the other technologies.</p>

    <intervention id="4-014" speaker_id="2097" name="Giles Chichester" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the ECR Group">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I have to express some regret at the obsession on the left side of this Parliament with nuclear energy, which has meant that we have two resolutions before the House today, most of the content of which has much in common except for this issue of nuclear energy, particularly when it is the only proven technology to supply large volumes of ultra low-carbon electricity in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we are to wean ourselves off fossil fuels – especially oil and coal – we will need all the low-carbon energy technologies we can get. Many of them are still more potential than production, and we must be realistic about how successful we have been in achieving target levels of energy from renewable sources. The EU has a record of setting very ambitious targets and a 100% record of failing to achieve them. We must do better.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the mean time we must lose no time in increasing the share of European electricity supplied by nuclear energy. It already produces the largest amount of electricity, but, as we switch to and develop alternative and new technologies, we will need base-load electricity to keep the lights on and, for example, to power electric vehicles.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is huge potential in new green technologies such as solar thermal from the Sahara and wind farms from the North Sea, not to mention carbon capture and storage and basic improvements in energy efficiency, where – at least on that point – I agree with my Green colleague across the floor, but all of this requires massive investment, and that is the fundamental point about these questions today.</p>

    <intervention id="4-015" speaker_id="96820" name="Marisa Matias" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group">
      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we are here to discuss the reinvention of a European energy system through investment in low-carbon technologies.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I think it is one of the most important challenges, as mentioned in the communication. It is one of the challenges we must focus on, but there is no clarification here, so it is important to ask these questions and to seek clarification. It seems that not only is there no financial clarification, but there is also no political clarification.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We speak of energy efficiency, of carbon capture, nuclear energy, bio-fuels, solar energy, and we speak inclusively of energy efficiency as the cheapest way to reduce emissions. It strikes me that there are other, much cheaper ways to reduce carbon emissions which are not even mentioned in this communication, such as, for example, reducing energy consumption, micro-generation, distribution and different forms of distribution, and different projects, which do not just have to be large structures, and access to energy. I believe that here we would certainly contribute towards enhanced financial clarification to select the cheapest plan.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, as part of this political clarification and this financial clarification, we need to discuss what, in my view, is a vitally important matter, which is that the emphasis is always on public-private partnerships, as if they were the solution to everything.</p>
      <p sl="pt">When we ask where the money comes from, the Commission tells us it comes from wherever it is. I confess that I do not feel more enlightened by being told that the money will come from wherever it is, without saying exactly where it is.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Therefore, in terms of counting on public-private partnerships, which is what systematically happens when we talk about low-carbon technologies, we surely have one certainty: not knowing where the money comes from and knowing that there are public-private partnerships, we know, from the outset, who will pay. It is taxpayers who will pay in the beginning, consumers who, incidentally, are ultimately taxpayers, too. We also know that those that pay less are institutions and private organisations – that they are those who make investments, are paid for it but, in the end, keep the profits for themselves.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Without this clarification, it seems to me that, once again, we are systematically leaving future generations to foot the bill for changing the European energy model.</p>

    <intervention id="4-016" speaker_id="28226" name="Christian Ehler" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in principle, we all agree that the SET plan is to be welcomed. We agree about large tranches of the content, but we have two problems. On the one hand, we will not be able – and I very much address this point to Mr Turmes – to build up pressure together on the Member States and on the Commission if we continue to hold an ideological debate where the subject is always nuclear energy. That is the sticking point in today’s votes. We have reached a compromise on the SET plan, and that compromise is that we have specified the criteria according to which we want to support this, and those criteria are clearly defined, namely sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply. We have said that we want to work without limitation to specific technologies and we are again having an ideological debate about nuclear power, which is a discussion that can be held, but which ultimately makes no sense in the context of the SET plan.</p>
      <p sl="de">I concede to you in respect of the question of what the SET plan can actually achieve. Has the question of to what extent the Member States are prepared to find a coherent energy policy approach actually been resolved? What the Council has put in place today is a series of platitudes. The problems, really, are not so much what we lay down in the SET plan, but how the assorted funds for research, innovation and the money from the SET plan, the issue of demonstration facilities, the issue of the transposal of European directives at national level – how all of this interacts. We are currently at a point where we have to say really clearly that we can produce another SET plan and that we can adopt another SET plan, but what we need now are tangible measures. That being the case, we should not always be arguing over the details. We should increase the pressure on the Commission and the Member States so that something happens in terms of implementation.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, wishful thinking is not enough to bring about a changeover to sustainable, renewable energy sources and to a climate-friendly society. Substantial investment is also needed. The private sector must, to a large extent, share the responsibility for funding the basic research and the Member States must also make a greater commitment. In addition, more money needs to be made available from the EU budget.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The budget must quite simply be adapted to conform with the political priorities relating to solar and wind energy, energy efficiency and so on. We need to reprioritise and redistribute funds within the EU budget. This is the only way in which the SET plan and the Members of this House can maintain their credibility.</p>

    <intervention id="4-018" speaker_id="4554" name="Chris Davies" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, it is three years since the Council set itself a target of having up to 12 CCS demonstration projects in operation by 2015, and we have not got much to show for it yet.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yes, we have identified a source of funding and we have now got a draft decision from the Commission, which is awaiting confirmation by Parliament, as to how to use that funding, but it will not be until the end of next year before we are able to identify a project which will qualify for this funding. So the timetable is very tight and meeting that 2015 deadline becomes more and more difficult. There is slippage at every step of the way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I ask the Commission to consider these things. First, that timetable needs to be examined. Can days, can weeks be shaved off it at all? And, in particular, can we put as much pressure as possible on the European Investment Bank to keep within the allocation it has been given in the draft decision?</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, once Parliament’s comitology procedure has been concluded, the Commission should make an announcement about the timetable. It should publish this. That will help ensure that there is a minimum amount of slippage. It will keep everyone working towards a series of set deadlines.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, remember that the biggest single delaying factor is likely to be the application that project developers have to go through to get planning permission for the pipelines and the like to take away CO2 . That could be very lengthy. It could blow the deadline completely out of the window.</p>
      <p sl="en">So can I ask for a statement from the Commission, insisting that developers seeking European funding start applying for planning permission now. Let them put their money where their mouth is.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the resolution which has been presented illustrates very well the dominance of climate policy over energy security in the European Union. It also illustrates clearly the antinuclear prejudice of part of this House. It so happens that nuclear energy is the only commercially proven low-carbon energy source, but in spite of this it is very severely criticised in the resolution. The European Union’s limited financial resources are to be invested in select energy sources just because they are sustainable, and this represents a strong market intervention. This policy will certainly limit expenditure on strategic large infrastructure projects which are already needed today, and on support for interconnectors. There simply will not be enough money for energy security. This is why we cannot endorse this resolution today.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, we all know very well that drug addicts are very dangerous, for they will stop at nothing to get their next fix. In fact, we know that any form of addiction is an unwelcome phenomenon that must be eradicated. In the European Union, our economy is addicted, and this addiction is fuelled by imported oil and gas. This is the situation we must alter. We must increase investment in technologies that will directly increase the use and exploitation of solar, wind, water and biomass in the European Union. What is more, there are several powerful arguments why it should be these particular technologies. Firstly, if we do not invest in these technologies, our addiction to oil and gas will only grow and the situation will get worse, for these resources will become ever scarcer throughout the world and prices will go up even more. Secondly, by making these investments, we shall at the same time be able to encourage SMEs in particular, if we give them certain advantages in applying for financial resources and funds. Thirdly, by investing in new technologies, we shall directly overcome the current obstacles to balancing electricity grids with the variable quantities of electricity generated from sun and wind. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for action. We must lessen our addiction to imported oil and gas, and we must support investment in precisely those technologies that will increase and promote greater use of solar, wind, water and biomass energy resources.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, we have reason to be pleased with the SET Plan. Without the EUR 59 billion which are now being invested in sound energy projects, we will not reach our renewable energy target of 20% by 2020. Investment in real and sustainable renewable energy accounts for two thirds of the SET Plan funds. This applies, for example, to photovoltaics, wind turbines and biomass. However, the SET Plan is not only important and right because it ensures us cleaner energy. The SET Plan is also critical to our attempts to put the social and economic crisis behind us. With these massive investments in modern energy technology, we will be able to create hundreds of thousands of new green jobs. We will also be able to make the EU a centre of knowledge when it comes to green and sustainable technology. Let us not forget, however, that these investments come with a responsibility: a responsibility to ensure that many of the people who are currently employed in the energy sector are given the opportunity to retrain and upskill themselves. That is why investment in technology must go hand in hand with investment in people.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are two brief points I wish to make. The first relates to the importance of investment in low-carbon technologies and the second to carbon capture in agriculture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, in realistic terms, it is essential that the EU focuses its attention and budget towards the Strategic Energy Technology Plan. For the EU to reach its 2020 target figures, there is no doubt that increased targeted investment in low-carbon technologies is essential.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, there must be increased research and investment in carbon capture and storage as a practical way of combating climate change. Here agriculture can play a key role in carbon sequestration and can contribute to the 2020 targets.</p>
      <p sl="en">Soil biomasses and natural carbon sinking – carbon in soil – could bring added benefit for farmers by reducing erosion and fertiliser inputs. Further research and investment is required in order to fully utilise agriculture and agricultural land to capture carbon and assist in reaching 2020 targets.</p>

      <p sl="en">The region I represent already has an EU fund of over EUR 250 million for low-carbon economic growth. Whilst its ambitions are worthy, the performance of this fund in actually making meaningful investments has fallen well below expectations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The East of England, including Cambridge University, is also home to leading research facilities, and over 250 contracts have been signed in my region for Framework 7 grants.

      <p sl="ro">Achieving the climate targets set by the European Union depends on devising a strategy supporting a gradual transition to low-carbon industry and the use of sustainable energy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The use of new technologies can cut energy consumption in buildings by up to 17% and carbon emissions from transport by up to 27%, while introducing smart metering could reduce energy consumption by up to 10%. A standard methodology is required for measuring energy consumption and carbon emissions in order to achieve the optimum public and private energy consumption. With this in mind, we need to have common minimum functional specifications and interoperable smart networks at European level.</p>

Regardless of how climate and weather conditions for the last few months in our continent have been tending to supply arguments to those scientists who are calling into question the influence of man on climate change by CO2 emissions, we should, none the less, when talking about low-emission technologies in this context, ask the following question: how can the means necessary for the development of clean technologies be ensured, to achieve the maximum effects in the shortest possible time?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think the system which is being created for support of research and development should be as flexible as possible, to enable resources to be managed in a way which is appropriate to the dynamics of scientific research.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, in the Communication from the Commission of 23 January 2008 entitled ‘Supporting early demonstration of sustainable power generation from fossil fuels’, which is part of the climate and energy package, it was stated that the European Union would support the construction of 10 to 12 carbon dioxide capture and storage demonstration plants. At the end of 2008, the European Parliament took up this matter, too, in a resolution. Item 11 of this document stated that the measures which had been unveiled by the Commission were not sufficient to provide the desired incentives for constructing at least 12 demonstration facilities by 2015, while in item 18 it was considered imperative that at least the 12 demonstration facilities earmarked for assistance should cover all possible combinations of the three carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The financial means are supposed, however, to come from the sale of 300 million allowances for CO2 emissions in the New Entrants’ Reserve, or what is known as NER300. Consequently, the sum intended for support of construction of the demonstration plants is going to depend on the market price of the allowances. It is estimated that this will be from EUR 7–12 billion. From the proposed decisions of the Commission contained in the motion it can be gathered that support under NER300 will cover six carbon dioxide capture and storage projects in power generation and two in industry.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we have heard a lot of nonsense today about green jobs. The fact is that our obsession with renewables is already driving up the cost of electricity and forcing European citizens into fuel poverty. Higher energy prices mean that energy-intensive businesses in Europe will simply give up and go away, to more favourable jurisdictions. Higher energy prices mean lower growth and higher unemployment, and they cost jobs. I have only seen one formal study into this question of green jobs. That was in Spain, and it demonstrated that, for every single job created in the green sector, 2.2 jobs were lost elsewhere.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we are really serious about low-carbon electricity, there is only one solution and that is nuclear power.

It must do everything it can to achieve these goals. We must be well aware that talking about a low-emission economy means a kind of Copernican revolution for the production system; it means changing many things, having clear priorities and political will but, above all, sufficient resources and instruments.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, Commissioner, financing the changeover to green low-carbon technologies will be particularly difficult in the case of the new Member States. One potential and very important source for Central European and Baltic States would be the use of the emission credits accumulated under the Kyoto Protocol’s emissions trading system, thereby profiting from these countries’ climate resources. The condition for doing so, of course, would be the creation of a post-Kyoto system or support from the European Council and the Commission in our efforts to get proper value for our remaining climate resources. As rapporteur for biogas, I am well aware of the cost of new technologies, and thus that technological development would be very important. It is very important to pursue this point within the framework of the common agricultural policy, for instance by altering the composition of livestock feed, by introducing ploughing methods other than deep tilling and introducing new, innovative technologies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">One of the most important priorities enshrined in the long-term strategy of the European Union should be to create an innovative economy, for example by transforming the present energy system using a low-emission model, particularly one that is based on clean carbon technologies. Around 80% of primary energy used in the European Union comes from fossil fuels. Over the past few decades, networks and chains of supply have been perfected in terms of supplying society with energy coming from these very sources. Economic growth and prosperity have been built on oil, coal and gas, and it is difficult to change this from one day to the next. The European Strategic Energy Technology Plan, which is a pillar of European Union policy on energy and climate, is a good step in the direction of shifting the European Union to an innovative economy, provided, of course, that it takes into account the financing of clean carbon technologies. If Europe wants to achieve ambitious reduction goals economically, it is essential that it increases expenditure on research in the field of clean, sustainable and efficient energy technologies and coordination of the combining of forces, potential and resources in both the public and private sectors.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Industrial revolutions in the past have shown that technology can change our way of life permanently. Currently, we have an unrepeatable and feasible opportunity to change our model of energy production. However, investing in the development and promotion of sources of clean, renewable energy can only be realised as long as the Community ensures a sufficient level of finance and includes these investments in the list of the European Union’s strategic goals.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate on the European Union’s energy choices, one thing is certain: the most significant, cheapest and most sustainable energy source available to us is saved energy. For natural, historical, cultural and economic reasons, mountain regions are a model for reducing energy consumption, in line with the demands of modern life, and they lend themselves to large-scale experimentation with the use of renewable energy sources with low-carbon emissions.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mountain regions produce almost all of Europe’s hydroelectric energy. To give an example, the province where I come from in Italy alone produces 12% of the hydroelectric energy of the entire country. Furthermore, in mountain areas there is historical experience of constructing buildings that are more efficient in terms of saving energy. We have managed to build homes that are completely self-sufficient in terms of both electricity and heating and that even supply more energy than they use, obviously with the use of advanced technologies. The mountains are often a testing ground, and so are the ideal environment for experimenting with better use of biomass, solar energy, geothermal energy, heat pumps and, above all, for overhauling energy distribution systems.</p>
      <p sl="it">Commissioner, the mountains are full of energy, clean energy: we just need to take it. For this reason we ask the Commission to involve mountain regions in its strategy, to look carefully at their experience and to recognise their right to receive fair compensation for all the renewable energy already supplied by these regions. Article 174 of the Treaty of Lisbon recognises the role of mountains, which is why we are anxiously waiting for an initiative from the Commission to implement this article and for a European mountain policy also in the field of energy.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore call on the Commission to follow the recommendations of the Durnwalder report, in the Committee of the Regions, and to include in the assessment of European territories the energy issues and the production capacity of mountain regions in terms of renewable energy and passive construction.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mountains, which make up 40% of European territory and are home to 90 million people, have, up to now, been seen as disadvantaged areas: by implementing innovative and consistent energy policies, these regions can overcome this handicap and provide a vital stimulus to achieve the objectives set in the 20-20-20 strategy, showing that energy self-sufficiency is possible, at an acceptable cost, if the firm political will is there.</p>

      <p sl="es">I think we have clear consensus over the fact that those initiatives are fundamental if we are to reduce our energy dependence, improve our efficiency, continue to make technological progress – thereby giving a further boost to European technology – and, of course, meet the challenges of climate change.</p>
      <p sl="es">These initiatives are also necessary to maintain European competitiveness and create employment. I think I can reassure Mr Helmer: there are other studies apart from the one he has read, some of which were carried out by the Commission itself, showing the positive impact on employment – an effect that will be even greater in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="es">We therefore propose that a set of common principles and practices be applied, giving direction to existing industrial initiatives. This will, of course, among other things, require us to establish financial tools and public intervention criteria that are needed to support the development of these technologies.</p>
      <p sl="es">A great deal of emphasis has been placed on financial aspects, and this is also a concern shared by the Council. However, the Council cannot commit to reassigning funds without respecting the Commission’s right of initiative and the powers shared by Parliament in this area. Therefore, in the meantime the current financing agreements will have to be applied.</p>
      <p sl="es">Nevertheless, we need to insist on the importance of increasing our budgets in order to develop these new technologies, and on the fact that prioritising those increases must be a fundamental element in future discussions within the European institutions, particularly this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">I can also assure you that the Council has done and will continue to do everything it can to guarantee that the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan has proper funding, within the context of both the current financial framework and future frameworks.</p>
      <p sl="es">As the Commissioner has already said, I would like to recall that, in general terms, private initiatives – private sources of funding – also have an important role to play; this is an area in which we need to work hand in hand in order to maximise the impact of public financial resources. We need to achieve a large-scale, multiplying effect that enables us to successfully implement these initiatives which are vital to the future of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first of all I would like to thank you for this discussion. I followed it very closely and there are many things which we will certainly take into consideration when developing our future work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me start with a short story. After the 1970s oil crisis we saw enthusiasm for innovation adding a competitive edge, even respecting the environment, on an unprecedented scale, but this was short lived. After oil prices had fallen consistently for long enough, investment in R&amp;D and deployment was dropped, market case for new technologies removed, shifting consumption patterns, and we were pushed into a period of tricky comfort where we depended on cheap foreign energy. It was a period with the illusion of sustainability.</p>
      <p sl="en">By the way, energy R&amp;D investment immediately after the oil crisis was approximately four times higher than currently or some years ago.</p>
      <p sl="en">And where are we today, after that period of reluctant and irresponsible development lacking a proactive approach? Reacting to climate change threats and trying to solve energy security dependence, so I do believe that a proactive vision is a realistic and necessary approach and not a daydream.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context – the things underlined in the paper we adopted a few days ago: the European Union 2020 Strategy – we see no alternative to green growth. We need more clean industries, not more cleaning-up industries. We need incentives, prices, costs and the right signals. We need to focus on energy efficiency; we need to focus, if you like, on resource efficiency, which is one of the major things included in EU 2020.</p>
      <p sl="en">I shall turn now to the second issue, which is the SET Plan that we are discussing. All the estimates presented in the SET Plan for the financing required are based on technology road maps. This was a very serious piece of work. If you look at the proposals, what we envisage, how we estimate the financing needed for the future, you will find the following figures: wind: 6; solar: 16; bio: 19; CCS: 13; nuclear: 7; smart grids: 2; fuel cells and hydrogen: 5; Smart Cities: 11; European Energy Research Alliance: 5, and basic research: 1. If you add that up, it comes to 75.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would remind you that there is a figure of 7 for nuclear. I have to be fair. Fusion is not included, and fusion is, again, a serious figure which should come, but if we look at this picture I think that our message from the Commission side on where we should put the bulk of our investment is pretty clear.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next issue is the sources of finance and the road maps. The main sources, as I said in my introduction, will have to come from where the main sources are, and that is industry and the Member States. This means the European Union budget, current and future financial perspectives, the European Energy Programme for Recovery, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and, of course, use of the other instruments that exist, and the European Investment Bank especially should be considered in this respect.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a serious question of the structure of the investment for the various initiatives proposed. I think it is obvious that the internal structure of public and private investment will not be the same because of the market proximity, because of the market failures you face in various types of technologies, which would need to be addressed, but I do believe that what is in front of you is a serious case, especially when you start discussing the next financial perspective, and that we have to rethink what our priorities are and how we should invest in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The next thing I would like to mention is that we will start all but one initiative – the Smart Cities, which came later, on your initiative, and which talks predominantly about resource efficiency – during 2010, but do not think that the things we are talking about here are not ongoing already: they are, especially in research. The Research Alliance has been working for a few years on this item already.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last thing I would like to mention is that, with the SET Plan, we are actually starting something very specific at European Union level. You know that, during my previous mandate, I fought very hard for a European research area. At European level we deal with approximately five per cent of research money, so unless we join our forces at EU level – meaning Europe level – and avoid duplicating our efforts, we cannot count on real success. Do not look only to the European budget. We should put the money together to step up our research capacity.</p>
      <p sl="en">The SET Plan is the best example we currently have of joint programming at EU level. Other activities are also coming, and rightly so, but I think we should not underestimate what is happening here. Here we are talking about public-public-private partnerships, which are very necessary and one of the issues to which I would draw your attention for the future. There is also the Financial Regulation where you will discuss it. It has to allow risk-taking if we seriously want these questions to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think we are behind one of the major new developments in Europe when we talk about the SET Plan, about joint programming, which is behind this. We have here the European Energy Research Alliance – the best research organisations opened outward – which is already working together today on all these major issues.</p>
      <p sl="en">My final message is that I think it is our major duty to put our political weight behind this programme.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although I acknowledge that this Commission communication aims to speed up the development of new technologies with higher potential for low-carbon emissions through greater energy efficiency and the utilisation of renewable energy, I regret that the European regions still lack a more defined role in this strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is necessary to guarantee regional authorities the correct financing, for example ensuring financing during the testing phase of pilot projects, or investment during the research and testing phase of renewable energy projects.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe that it is important to include, for example, geothermal energy. This is a renewable energy source with great potential for expansion in volcanic regions, that is particularly important for remote and island regions of the Union, and for which no goals have been set.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, public and private investment must be increased by developing energy technologies so as to reach the desired goals of a low-carbon economy and also to help overcome the market failures referred to in the climate and energy package.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I think it is significant that the European Commission, when drawing up its Strategic Energy Technology Plan, took into consideration the amount of support needed for research and development of green technologies. This is all the more true because, at the present stage, solar energy, bio-energy and hydrogen technology are in most cases not yet commercially profitable. As Steven Chu, the United States Secretary of Energy rightly pointed out, research advances of Nobel Prize calibre are needed in order to make green technologies competitive with traditional fossil fuel technologies. However, the serious flaw of the green technology plan is that we have no idea what EU funds will be used to carry it out. Looking at the cost of EUR 16 billion deemed necessary for solar energy research, or the EUR 5 billion estimated for hydrogen-related technology, this cannot be a minor consideration. At this point there are no indications that the next seven-year financial framework will provide increased resources for research in green technologies. We are well aware that support from public funds is no substitute for the efforts of private investors. Nevertheless, the European Union and Member States must boost the funds devoted to green technology research. The eventual revenues from an emission trading system may serve as a good basis for this. The stakes are not negligible. We cannot allow the plans for energy policy and climate protection to suffer the same fate as the Lisbon Strategy with its contradictory outcomes.</p>

      <p sl="en">To make Carbon Technology a practical reality we need to address the shortage of engineers and other high-skilled personnel designing and producing advanced technologies. We can do this by setting up or intensifying training schemes or scholarships to ensure that workers’ skills are upgraded in time for economic recovery. We need to ensure a supply of highly qualified and well-educated workers with the right combination of both theoretical and practical skills.We also need to tackle persisting barriers to mobility within the EU, in particular for researchers and highly skilled people and to address the issue of EU-wide recognition of engineers’ qualifications. Financial markets &amp; institutions tend to be cautious about investing, particularly where SMEs are concerned number of EU schemes supporting innovation, although they need to be better synchronised and coordinated from both supply and demand perspectives. We need to facilitate cooperation between SMEs and research institutes, promoting IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) and technology transfer. EEI businesses themselves need to become more proactive in supporting cluster initiatives and joining clusters. We also need to stimulate research and innovation through tax incentives or innovation vouchers, and by improving the conditions for risk capital investment, for instance for business angels or cross-border venture capital.</p>

      <p sl="en">Global climate warming caused by human activity is a fact. Combating this process and its negative effects is the need of the hour. One way of dealing with these problems is to use clean and renewable energy sources. However, for these energy sources to play a significant role in the European energy system, two conditions have to be met. Firstly, we need an increase in funding available for research into their development. Secondly, we need an increase in funding for investments which implement the latest low-emission technologies. Investing in the development of the low-emission technologies contained in the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan is important from the point of view of the entire EU. In particular, however, it is important for countries whose energy industry – for historical reasons – emits large amounts of CO2 . One such country is Poland. Improving and developing technologies for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a matter of vital significance for the whole of the Polish economy.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the Commission statement on the effects of storm Xynthia in Europe.</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="4-055" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Janez Potočnik" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Member of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, only two weeks after the dreadful disaster on Madeira, the Commission was again shocked and saddened by the death and devastation caused by storm Xynthia in France and other European countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">I wish to express my personal sympathy to all those that are suffering as a consequence of the disaster. The Commission’s condolences go in particular to the families and friends of those that have lost their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">Through the monitoring and information centre for civil protection, the Commission has been monitoring the events caused by storm Xynthia closely and has offered to set the mechanism for EU assistance in action. Fortunately, the French rescue services were able to respond to the disaster with their own means and did not request the activation of the mechanism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Together with the relevant authorities in the Member States, the Commission is now exploring all the possibilities and instruments that could be available at EU level to assist financially in overcoming the disaster and to help return to normal living conditions as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two days ago, Commission President Barroso met French President Sarkozy to discuss the situation. Yesterday he also met with a number of Members of this House from different countries. One week ago my colleague, Mr Hahn, Commissioner responsible for regional policy and the Solidarity Fund, visited the most hard-hit regions in France – La Rochelle and l’Aiguillon-sur-Mer – and met with national and regional authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">On Madeira, where disaster struck two weeks earlier, the authorities and rescue services have been able to make enormous progress in combating the effects of the flooding disaster. Commissioner Hahn visited Madeira during the past weekend to get a first-hand impression and to discuss with the local authorities the way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union Solidarity Fund was set up in 2002 specifically as the instrument at EU level to financially assist EU Member States affected by major natural disasters, if certain conditions are met. France has already declared its intention to apply for assistance from the Solidarity Fund. I should point out that the Regulation governing the Solidarity Fund normally allows its mobilisation only for what are known as ‘major disasters’, where the damage at national level exceeds the threshold of 0.6% of gross national income, or EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices. For France this currently means the damage would have to exceed approximately EUR 3.4747 billion at current prices.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, in exceptional circumstances and if specific criteria are met, the fund may also be used for smaller ‘extraordinary regional disasters’, in particular where they concern outermost regions like Madeira.</p>
      <p sl="en">The French authorities are currently carrying out an assessment of the damage and of its repercussions for the economy and the living conditions of the population.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are the essential elements for the application, which has to reach the Commission within 10 weeks of the disaster. That means before 9 May. After it is received it will be examined by the Commission as quickly as possible. The Commission services, in particular DG Regional Policy, are granting all possible assistance and guidance in preparing the application. Contacts at expert level are well established with the French authorities, thus allowing effective progress.</p>
      <p sl="en">Please be aware, however, that aid from the Solidarity Fund cannot be paid out immediately. The Solidarity Fund should not be misunderstood as an emergency instrument. It is a financial instrument to help bear the financial burden of emergency operations. As such, a possible grant could be used retroactively for emergency operations from day one of the disaster.</p>
      <p sl="en">The funding for the Solidarity Fund is raised through an extra effort of the Member States outside the normal European Union budget. It has to be approved by Parliament and the Council through an amending budget procedure.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the whole procedure – from the moment the application is made to paying out the grant – inevitably takes several months. The Commission is, however, making every effort to keep this time span as short as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards the Structural Funds, in particular the ERDF, this can of course not be used for immediate emergency operations. France and the Commission have, however, started discussing the options and possible necessary programme modifications which might be instrumental for longer-term reconstruction and for investment in businesses affected by the flood.</p>
      <p sl="en">One last point, which Members of this House already raised during the debate on Madeira two weeks ago. The Commission will use the current political momentum to attempt to unblock the proposal for an amended Solidarity Fund regulation at the Council. Parliament widely supported this proposal, and I feel this is the right moment to take common action vis-à-vis the Council again.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, during the evening of 27-28 February, storm Xynthia hit the coasts of Charente-Maritime and Vendée, my region, particularly hard. Fifty-three people died, a dozen people are unaccounted for, and hundreds of people have lost their homes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">These are significant losses, and they are compounded by serious problems in relation to infrastructure. I am referring in particular to the dams, to the railway lines, to the sewage networks, to the electricity networks, to the telecommunication networks and to the entire system of small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular in the maritime sector, in the aquaculture sector and in the agricultural sector, with 45 000 hectares submerged by salt water, since this was a flood that originated in the sea.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This is damage on a significant scale. This is damage of which the consequences will continue to be felt over time, since some farming land will now be unfit for use for several years.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call here for the European Union to show solidarity and, of course, for this European Union Solidarity Fund to be made available in the best possible conditions and in the quickest possible time, because we cannot tell our fellow citizens that the funds will wait and that the problems cannot be resolved here and now. Together, we need, after the visit by the Commissioner – whom I sincerely thank for going and seeing for himself the scale of the disaster, and I know that he too has been deeply affected by it – unite our efforts to improve the use of this fund, so that progress can be made more quickly. We are always complaining that Europe is too far removed from our fellow citizens; let us show them here, today, that we are capable of reacting quickly. I regret that the Council is not here to help us with this regulatory amendment. In any case, rest assured that we need it and that our fellow citizens are expecting it.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of the natural disasters that have hit Portugal, Madeira, France and Spain.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Last week, a delegation from my Group went to Madeira, visited the areas most affected by the catastrophe and met with the regional and local authorities and business, industrial, trade and farmers’ associations.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We retain striking images and messages from what we saw and heard. We learnt of entire families who died in their own homes; we heard dramatic testimonies about people being pulled under the water, never to be seen again. Entire houses moved from one side of the street to the other, and cars still containing their passengers were swept away from the streets into the sea.</p>
      <p sl="pt">However, the courage of Madeira’s people in overcoming adversity was equally striking. I will never forget the pictures of determination of those who,despite losing their businesses, their homes and their possessions, refused to give up. On the contrary, they got straight to work, ready to start again from scratch. In just a few days, tonnes and tonnes of stone, earth and other debris were removed from the centre of the city of Funchal.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The national, regional and local authorities joined efforts so that life on the island could go back to normal. Therefore, it is important to announce that tourists can return to Madeira. Its natural beauty and the warmth of its people await us.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The people of Madeira are now also awaiting the solidarity of the European institutions to be able to rebuild the roads, bridges and public buildings that were destroyed. The tradesmen, industrialists and farmers also need our support in rebuilding their lives and contributing to the economic development of the region.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am greatly pleased, Commissioner, to hear that the Commission, as well as Parliament and the Council, is determined to unblock the Cohesion Fund – the new proposal that has already been adopted by Parliament – so that new rules that are better adapted to the real needs of the public can be implemented.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As you know, Commissioner, it is also necessary that the other structural funds are restructured and redeployed to the most affected areas, because special situations require special solutions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to join with the declarations of sympathy for the victims of storm Xynthia, which has affected several areas of Europe. We must take action and in this regard I appreciated the serious declarations made today by Commissioner Potočnik, whose expertise I value and whose commitment I must acknowledge. In this regard, I call on him to make the necessary amendments to the Solidarity Fund, reminding him though that Parliament already adopted the measure by a large majority in 2006. Given these situations and given these deaths, we can only reiterate how critical it is to adopt measures such as this.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, at the same time, Mr President, we must act on several fronts and firstly review all the development and regional planning programmes and update them in view of their environmental impact, also including an assessment of the effects on the ground. We also need to invest substantial sums to establish long-term action aimed at implementing a disaster prevention strategy. This is not an optional or fanciful choice, but a necessary choice if we want disasters such as those we are discussing today not to have such tragic consequences.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, there are also economic reasons, if we want to limit ourselves solely to this aspect, which oblige the institutions to take action in terms of prevention. While we are claiming in the resolution that it is necessary to pledge substantial amounts to repair the damage, we must shift our attention and our action to investments and initiatives for environmental protection, reforestation and the protection of vegetation, given that these will reduce the costs of repairing environmental damage.</p>
      <p sl="it">We must learn from disasters of this kind – modern man must learn from them – that not everything can be controlled but that everything can be limited if adequate precautions are taken. We must do it, Mr President, also in memory of victims such as those who, in recent days and in recent weeks, unfortunately, throughout Europe have characterised the reality of our regions.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I would also like to express my deepest sympathy – my own and that of my Group – and my solidarity with the affected regions, while regretting the serious economic consequences of these disasters and offering in particular our condolences to the families of the victims. It is also important to emphasise the need for national, regional and local authorities now to focus on effective prevention policies and to pay more attention to adequate practices and legislation relating to land use.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is precisely for this reason that there are two amendments that we tabled as a group, because, in our view, they are missing in the joint resolution. The first states: whereas in France construction has been authorised on flood plains and on natural wetlands; whereas building speculation has encouraged the construction of buildings in vulnerable areas. For us this is a vital aspect to make progress.</p>
      <p sl="it">The second amendment calls for cofinancing by Community funds for implementing these plans, in particular the Structural Funds, the EAFRD, the Cohesion Fund and the European Solidarity Fund, to be subject to sustainability measures. For us this is vital in ultimately deciding whether or not we will vote in favour of the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, our first words can only be of condolence and solidarity for the families of the victims of this catastrophe. We welcome the European Union’s words of solidarity for the affected regions and towns. It is important now to make this solidarity tangible, by quickly mobilising the necessary means and resources to relieve the damage caused by bad weather.</p>
      <p sl="pt">In the past years, the Member States have been hit by a considerable number of catastrophes, as demonstrated by the 62 requests to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, made by a total of 21 countries, in only its first six years of existence.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The damage caused by these catastrophes is hard to assess, particularly because of the loss of human life. In any case, the economic and social costs are almost always very significant.</p>
      <p sl="pt">It is in this context that prevention will have to play a more important social role, and become an increasingly important phase in the catastrophe management process. It is important to develop cooperation and solidarity in this area within the European Union. First of all, by creating a financial framework suitable for prevention that will support the implementation of protection measures for the public, the environment and the climate by the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The recipients of special aid must be, amongst others, such actions as the correction of potentially dangerous situations, the protection of the most risk-prone areas, the reinforcement of early warning systems in the Member States and the establishment and reinforcement of existing connections between the various early warning systems.</p>
      <p sl="pt">As it has already been said here, the sensible utilisation of land, economic and social development that is in harmony with nature, and strengthened cohesion in the European Union are also vital factors for the prevention of catastrophes.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several European regions have been hit by some exceptional natural meteorological phenomena, which have resulted in huge material, economic, agricultural and environmental damage, and have sadly claimed too many human lives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I dare to hope, Commissioner, that beyond your due condolences, the European Solidarity Fund, a European activity that in this case is useful, will be able to be implemented quickly and flexibly in both France and Madeira, just as it has been – as someone said – in other European countries, to help my compatriots in Vendée and Charente-Maritime restore their vital infrastructure and services.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is my understanding from what you have said that the French Government has not yet referred this matter to you, and I am very surprised at that. However, I must say that there are some aspects to the way in which certain people are exploiting these events that I find quite intolerable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Firstly, this compulsive need to link the natural disasters that we are suffering to so-called global warming. No matter what political or pseudo-scientific claims we may be fed, they will not dictate the weather and the tides any more than they will prevent earthquakes.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The second is the systematic search for culprits and easy scapegoats. The Xynthia disaster in the west of France is due to the very rare combination of two events: the storm itself, of course, and some unusually high tides, which led to the collapse of the dams.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Controversy has erupted over the building permits granted by the mayors, who have been made personally responsible for the deaths that have occurred in their municipalities. However, no one – not the département , the region, the public services, the town planners or the architects – objected to these building permits requested by individuals.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The elected representatives of the region, and in particular in the small municipalities, are quite rightly held in high regard by their fellow citizens. They shoulder a great deal of responsibility for virtually nothing, they have a remarkable sense of the general interest, they are coping with ever more complex duties, for which Europe is partly responsible, and they have also been completely abandoned by the public authorities, and I was anxious to point this out here.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) endorses the resolution and advocates that we convey appropriate expressions of condolence and solidarity and take direct action. There are a few points I would like to add to that. First of all, I think it is excellent that the Commission has stepped into the breach and that Mr Hahn is also considering how he might be able to alter his operational programmes. That also bodes well for the short term.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, the actual problem lies in the Solidarity Fund. How has the Council been able to get away for years with holding up action by Parliament to make the Solidarity Fund more flexible? In my opinion, it is really a very good thing that Mr Potočnik has been so unambiguous about the fact that the Commission will now be taking the initiative. The Spanish Presidency really ought to be here today in order to confirm that. Now is the time to act and Parliament is extremely unhappy about this hold-up.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, there is also a second dimension to this issue. I come from the Netherlands. Most of the Netherlands is situated below sea level. As the spring flooding of 1953 is still very vivid in our memories, we know that it is vital to look ahead. We know that safety and preventative measures have to go hand in hand with development in these regions, that is, development of any activities that have an impact on the coast. And that is definitely an achievable aim. We in the Netherlands have now come up with a plan, a delta plan, to reinforce our coastal defences and we are also looking into other matters where it is imperative that we link safety with economic development.</p>
      <p sl="nl">By way of conclusion, let me add that in 2008 an initiative was taken in the French coastal town of Saint Malo to assemble all coastal regions under the auspices of the United Nations, in conjunction with the OECD. The United Nations now has a disaster prevention plan for coastal regions and it is that world-wide perspective that is so very important. The European Parliament has a pilot project for the 2009-2010 period and we have supported our regions’ participation in it, by providing funding, amongst other means. The world-wide dimension is something that we have to get on the agenda here in the upcoming period.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the victims of the Madeira floods and of storm Xynthia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The necessary questions must be asked about the worrying increase in these destructive meteorological phenomena, and about the role played by climate change and the urgent need to find solutions. For now, it is a case of providing urgent solutions to the populations rocked by these disasters. Of course, public and private insurance providers must be responsive but, when it comes to the destroyed infrastructure and rebuilding the areas concerned, European solidarity must be expressed.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why the French Government has requested aid from the EU Solidarity Fund, created in 2002, which I hope will be granted quickly and meaningfully. This is the thrust of the two letters that I have sent to the Commission since 1 March in my capacity as an elected representative for the west of France region and which I had the opportunity to discuss, last Thursday, in La Rochelle, with Commissioner Hahn, whom I sincerely thank for being so responsive.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner Hahn agreed that the mechanism was complex and difficult to implement. Well, we have to conclude that it could have been made more flexible if the Council had not incomprehensibly blocked the review of the operation of this fund as adopted by a very large majority of MEPs in May 2006. I therefore hope that the Spanish Presidency will break the deadlock on this text so that the system can be made more effective.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In more immediate terms, I call on the Commission to authorise a one-off increase in cofinancing via the ERDF and ESF regional funds for projects in the regions affected, within a time frame that will enable their economies to recover by summer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, this aid should not be used to rebuild in such a way that the same tragic environmental and town planning mistakes are made; rather, it should be used in a considered way, so as to prevent as far as possible a repeat of such tragedies.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, following the disaster that has struck the French coast only a few weeks after Madeira, our group has tabled some amendments so that our Parliament, as well as expressing its solidarity, will denounce those responsible. For European citizens have not died and others have not lost everything in these disasters simply because the elements were unleashed. This also happened because some very grave mistakes were made in allowing the coastlines and riverbanks to become built-up. These mistakes are the fault of the Member States, of their laws, which are very inadequate, of their authorities, which are too lax, and of their governments, which are too unaccountable.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Having allowed building to take place in flood zones is no less serious than having permitted and encouraged the consumption of tobacco or asbestos over the years, even though people were dying and it was very clear that that was the reason why. Before Xynthia there was Madeira, and before Madeira there was Sicily; tomorrow, there will be other disasters. If the European Parliament does not raise its voice, it in turn will be accountable for the disasters of the future. The European Union must show its solidarity, but it must also demonstrate a sense of responsibility.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, like everyone here, our thoughts are first and foremost with the populations, with the bereaved families and with those who have lost everything as a result of storm Xynthia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the lessons to be learnt from this disaster will have been, once again, the usefulness of the services of the Member States, of the municipalities, of the departments, of the regions, including the public services and the civil protection services, which have demonstrated their effectiveness. As we all agree, today we must urgently help the families to repair and to rebuild, but we must rebuild in a different way, by taking account of nature and of human beings. To do so, we must encourage the insurance companies, which are swimming in profits, to reimburse people for the damage caused.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, given the exceptional nature of the disaster that has hit these regions, the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States, must take action on a much greater scale and more quickly, not least by harnessing the European Solidarity Fund, and it must do so in a more flexible manner than the one you have certainly just described, Commissioner. Indeed, the destruction of homes and businesses, and the sterilisation of farming land are probably impossible to quantify using our traditional criteria.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On the other hand, we will also have to combine the regional funds and the ESF Fund to help the regions get back on their feet. Beyond that, it is important to learn every lesson from what has just happened and to take action to prevent such disasters or to limit the damage of such climatic phenomena. The issue of building in flood zones and of combating real estate speculation along the coastline must be completely re-examined in connection with the balances of nature, farming activities, aquaculture, oyster faming and fishing, which European policies all too often destroy.</p>
      <p sl="fr">That is why I propose that the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States and the regions, should establish a consistent sustainable reconstruction and development plan that takes account of the geography, environment, biodiversity and activities along the coastline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, there must be an opportunity to establish a common prevention, monitoring and warning system by which swift, solidarity-based assistance can be provided to the populations.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as my colleague Mrs Morin-Chartier and the other Members have said, on 27 and 28 February the violent storm Xynthia battered several French regions, claiming 53 lives and causing huge material damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The storm was exceptionally intense; it caused devastating floods along the French coast. After Madeira, Europe has once again been affected. Brittany, the region of my colleague and friend, Mr Cadec, has been severely affected. A state of natural disaster has thus been declared in three French regions: Brittany, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the face of these disasters, the European Union must demonstrate its responsiveness and express its solidarity. Words and a resolution alone will not enable us to support the victims of these disasters; we must also and above all provide financial aid.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore call on the European Commission – and my colleague Mr Béchu supports my request – to swiftly release the EU Solidarity Fund so as to help the disaster areas cope with the damage.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This disaster shows that Mr Barnier’s proposal to create a European civil protection force is relevant. Europeans must take action together, since more and more disasters are occurring and they are affecting our European territories and, in particular, our most isolated and vulnerable regions, such as the islands in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean islands.</p>

      <p sl="es">Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Madeira with a delegation from the Committee on Regional Development of Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. It was the first time that a European delegation had had the opportunity to be there on the ground and to meet the authorities and people from the island.</p>
      <p sl="es">The storms that hit Madeira killed more than 40 people and wounded or displaced hundreds more. Economic losses are estimated at EUR 100 million with 900 businesses and more than 3 500 workers directly affected.</p>
      <p sl="es">The priority now is to rebuild infrastructure, ensure that the situation returns to normal and, above all, rebuild Madeira’s image abroad and regain people’s trust in its tourism industry, thereby stimulating its economy and development.</p>
      <p sl="es">A number of adverse weather conditions, particularly storm Xynthia, have also affected Spain, especially the areas of Andalusia and the Canary Islands, as well as western France and other countries.</p>
      <p sl="es">These major disasters have caused enormous economic damage and require an urgent, speedy and efficient response from the European Union; we therefore need to mobilise the necessary tools in order to tackle this kind of disaster.</p>

      <p sl="ro">There is also an urgent need to find a solution for kick-starting the review of the European Solidarity Fund Regulation. Based on its position in 2006, Parliament has approved the amendment to the regulation with the aim of creating the opportunity for a rapid, effective response, when a request is made by Member States. The lowering of the threshold for mobilising the Fund and the provision of a rapid payment based on a preliminary assessment are extremely important measures included in the revised form of the regulation.</p>

I want to express my sympathy to the family members affected, but also to those who, in the space of just a few hours, lost everything that they had spent their lives building up.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this time in particular, the European Union is under the microscope, and the Solidarity Fund was set up for precisely this kind of difficult situation, as the people of Madeira and France now need not only our sympathy but also, more than anything, our financial assistance.</p>
      <p sl="de">The disaster in France and on Madeira has also been intensified by the fact that people have perhaps been too ambitious in their attempts to control the natural world and have attempted to lead their lives by overruling the laws of nature. The fact that that is not possible in the long term has been demonstrated very painfully here again.</p>

      <p sl="es">The Solidarity Fund is obsolete and has not taken account of this Parliament’s resolution of 2006. It no longer has any value whatsoever. The figures given – 0.6% of GDP and EUR 3 billion – do not correspond to what this situation demands, for this is no longer just an emergency but also a reconstruction effort.

Allow me to express my sympathy to those who have been affected and my appreciation to all those who have helped provide the intervention after these disasters.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that Europe’s regions must be given far more financial support to help implement the measures for preventing these disasters. The European Union can make improvements and develop complex systems for analysing the causes of disasters in order to devise the most effective measures for preventing them. I think that measures specifically aimed at this can be included for every macro-region in Europe. I am thinking at the moment, even though it is not specifically referred to in this resolution, of the EU’s Danube Strategy, given that this river has been a source of natural disasters in the recent past, in 2002 and 2004.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Furthermore, the complementary use of all the resources available in the most accessible manner possible will facilitate the establishment of economic, social and territorial cohesion, providing a platform for acts of solidarity in the event of such disasters.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I come from a small village, with approximately 500 inhabitants, which was severely hit by floods just two years ago. It was actually a pure miracle – or, if you wish, lucky – that there were no human casualties. At that time we benefited greatly from the same Solidarity Fund that we are talking about. I fully understand the feelings of the people on the ground. They are also looking for solidarity from all around the European Union – solidarity which is fast and efficient.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I think it is of the utmost importance that we focus on the Solidarity Fund Regulation. As you know, the Commission proposal for an amendment to the European Union Solidarity Fund Regulation dates back to 2005. This proposal concerns mostly the extension of the fund to disasters other than natural ones. However, it also includes elements that might have been relevant in the case of Xynthia as well – a proposal to lower the thresholds and the possibility of paying advances of the expected aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">There have been signals from several Member States lately – including from France – that they may reconsider their negative position. Together with Parliament, the Commission intends taking a new initiative very shortly vis-à-vis the Council and its Spanish Presidency, to unblock the dossier.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also agree with the remark that we should do our utmost to be better prepared. The frequency and intensity of disastrous events is clearly increasing, and this is worrying. So I think that being better prepared is of the utmost importance. In this context, the Cohesion and Structural Funds should play their role also. There are also other possibilities which can be explored. I have already mentioned the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Also the Rural Development Fund can be redirected but of course only at the request of the Member State.</p>

After the disaster in Madeira, Europe was hit once again. My region, Brittany, has been severely affected, and a state of natural disaster has been declared in three departments, just as it has in the Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire regions. I should like to express my full solidarity with the families affected and with the victims of the disaster. The European Union as a whole must show its responsiveness and its solidarity by means of a financial aid package and support measures aimed at reconstruction. Mr Béchu joins me in requesting emergency aid. Today, the financial resources of the Solidarity Fund seem difficult to implement. It must be acknowledged that Parliament has been calling for more effective and swifter use of the EU Solidarity Fund since 2005. The Commission and the Council must facilitate the swift release of this fund for the affected regions. This disaster shows that the Barnier report on the creation of a European civil protection force – EuropeAid – makes perfect sense and would enable us to develop a more effective response to disasters.</p>

At EU level we have instruments available for dealing with such situations, which supplement the projects carried out by regions. For example, in the Western Region of Romania, which I represent, a project is being promoted for improving the capabilities and quality of the intervention system deployed in emergency situations. The financial instruments available, including the Structural and Cohesion Funds, as well as the Fund for Rural Development, must be reviewed so that they offer greater flexibility in emergencies.</p>
      <p sl="ro">With regard to the Solidarity Fund, the lowering of the threshold for mobilising the fund and the possibility of making advance payments of the relevant amounts would speed up intervention and reconstruction efforts and make them more effective.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, we will have to give due attention to an older initiative, namely the rapid reaction force, which will cover the entire territory of the European Union, because natural phenomena affect neighbouring regions, and this creates the conditions for solidarity and cross-border action.</p>

By losing personal property such as their homes, their livelihoods and their jobs, these populations could fall into a desperate situation. In these cases, social justice is only achieved through solidarity, not forgetting that all of society benefits from each of its citizens having decent living conditions.

Managing natural disasters is an opportunity for Europe to prove its added value. Rapid and uncomplicated cooperation between European partners is required in order to counter the dramatic consequences of the storm Xynthia and the devastating torrential rains. The Solidarity Fund and other EU financial instruments can at least make it possible to tackle the economic damage of the disaster more quickly. However, the organisation of disaster prevention must always remain in the hands of the Member States, who are best placed to deal with their national circumstances and thus to react most rapidly in emergencies. In order to prevent future storm damage, the Commission should support the Member States in their efforts to produce effective emergency plans and tables of risks. With the march of climate change and the dislocation of water cycles that that promotes, it will not be possible to completely fend off even fiercer storms in the future. However, the damage that such storms cause can certainly be reduced with better prior planning.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Storm Xynthia is another tragic and painful demonstration of the climatic disturbances that are intensifying the violence and the frequency of what are, nonetheless, natural phenomena. Nowadays, the European Union is confronted too often with such natural disasters to make do with its existing policies, and I believe that it should strengthen three areas of intervention in order to better protect its citizens: prevention, which is addressed in the 2009 White Paper on adapting to climate change, for which I was rapporteur for the opinion and which specifically emphasises the vulnerability of coastal and mountain areas; rapid intervention, by finally creating this European civil protection force, about which we have done nothing but talk and which only needs a proposal to become a reality; and repair, by permitting the emergency mobilisation of the Structural Funds – if necessary outside the regional framework of the planned areas of intervention – and of the Solidarity Fund, the regulation of which must be amended so as to speed up and simplify its mobilisation. It is clear, then, that I endorse this resolution, but I regret that our House should be obliged once again to call for measures that could have been proposed following one of the too numerous natural disasters that have plunged Europe into mourning in recent years.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I make this statement on behalf of my colleague, Kristalina Georgieva, Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response. Why instead of her? It is pretty clear and obvious. Commissioner Georgieva arrived in Chile yesterday, 10 March, to visit areas affected by the recent earthquake and to follow the work of European humanitarian and civil protection experts there on the ground.</p>
      <p sl="en">Immediately after arriving in Chile’s capital Santiago, Commissioner Georgieva travelled to the area most affected by the earthquake and tsunami, including the coastal region around Constitución, Talca, and Concepción.</p>
      <p sl="en">During her field visit she met representatives of ECHO partners working in the area, visited the monitoring and information centre base camp in Penco and had bilateral contacts with Chilean authorities in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner Georgieva will also represent President Barroso during the inauguration of President Sebastián Piñera in Valparaíso later today.</p>
      <p sl="en">The massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Chile in the early hours of Saturday 27 February are a terrible tragedy. The latest official figures indicate that at least 528 people have been killed, and that number is expected to rise. More than two million people are affected. The damage to infrastructure has been enormous and half a million homes have been seriously damaged.</p>
      <p sl="en">The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, called Chile’s Foreign Minister, Mariano Fernández, the same day to express our condolences to the families of the victims and indicate our readiness to provide assistance and support.</p>
      <p sl="en">As soon as news of the earthquake broke, ECHO’s emergency response system was mobilised. The EU civil protection mechanism immediately issued a pre-alert message to the participating states. The crisis room of the monitoring and information centre (MIC) operated throughout that first weekend, obtaining reports about the scale and impact of the earthquake, identifying civil protection assets that could be available for rapid deployment. Commissioner Georgieva went to the crisis room during the day to direct operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of European Union Member States have notified the MIC of assistance deployed or offered. This includes personnel and equipment already sent to Concepción from Spain, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, funding pledges from Finland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and offers of bridges, tents, field kitchens and generators from Bulgaria, Slovakia, Sweden and Austria.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Chilean authorities have signalled their acceptance of offers of help made by the European Union Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission’s emergency humanitarian response system was launched simultaneously in Brussels and in ECHO’s Managua regional office covering Latin America.</p>
      <p sl="en">Potential partners for fast-track funding with the capacity to provide immediate relief assistance were contacted and ECHO field experts were mobilised to travel to the earthquake zone at the first available opportunity. A three million primary emergency decision was adopted early on Sunday morning. Humanitarian grant agreements have now been concluded with four partner agencies: Telecom Sans Frontières from France to provide emergency telecommunications services; the Pan-American Health Organisation and the Spanish Red Cross to help re-establish health services, and the German Red Cross to supply shelter, safe water and basic household essentials.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said previously, the earthquake in Chile, which was more intense than the one suffered by the Haitians and which was also followed by a tsunami, was nonetheless much less deadly, thanks to an early warning system that worked, to populations that were better prepared for disasters and to a robust state that was able to react.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I welcome the rapid reaction of the European Commission and the Member States. The European Commission’s Monitoring and Information Centre was activated immediately, an emergency humanitarian decision was adopted to allocate EUR 3 million to respond to the immediate needs, and experts from the Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO) were deployed in the disaster areas to carry out a needs assessment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I would like in particular to applaud the immediate public reaction of Commissioner Georgieva, who arrived in Santiago yesterday to visit the areas concerned.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Most natural disasters are unexpected events. In order to preserve lives in areas vulnerable to natural disasters, it is vitally important to reduce the risks by being better prepared and having buildings that are fit for purpose. It is also important to ensure that development cooperation incorporates disaster risk reduction, that is to say, preparation for disasters, the mitigation of their effects and, above all, their prevention.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the delegation within the EU-Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee, I would like to express our solidarity with the Chilean people, Parliament and Government following the disastrous earthquake that occurred on 27 February and the more than two hundred aftershocks that have taken place so far.</p>
      <p sl="es">At least 500 people, including two Europeans, have been killed and 2 million Chileans have been affected by the earthquakes. The Mapuche people have been the worst affected, for their lands lie in three of the four southern regions of the country.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would also like to express our gratitude to all the people who have worked selflessly and to all the professionals who assisted the victims. The Chilean people have shown themselves to be capable of meeting the challenges of a very complex situation. I would like to congratulate President Bachelet for the immediate relief effort her Government launched in order to contain the situation caused by the terrible earthquake that has destroyed housing and infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Chilean Government acted quickly and showed seriousness and responsibility in identifying the specific areas in which support was needed; there has also been a show of solidarity from the international community, which is a testament to Chile’s excellent relations with its neighbours and strategic partners.</p>
      <p sl="es">I also wish to congratulate Sebastián Piñera’s new Government which takes office today, and to encourage him in the reconstruction efforts for which I hope he will be able to count on the European Union’s full support.</p>
      <p sl="es">Chile, as well as being a friend and partner of the European Union, is a developed country and member of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; even so, the cost of the reconstruction effort will be considerable: it is estimated that this will be as high as USD 20 million, which represents 15% of the Chilean GDP. For this reason, I call on the European Union to make every tool available to the Chilean authorities in order to help with the task of reconstruction. Chile is going to need international loans, and the European Investment Bank, with which Chile has just signed an agreement, should help with the financing of the reconstruction projects.</p>
      <p sl="es">The European Union, under the Spanish Presidency, has established a mechanism for coordinating aid with the United Nations, and a post-disaster task force; the European Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response is also expected to arrive on the ground in the next few days. We hope that the Commission, without overlooking other equally urgent commitments such as the situation in Haiti, will also rise to meet the Chilean people’s expectations.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we should use more than just words to show our solidarity with a country that has suffered a disaster, as Chile has, and we have heard this today from the Commission representative.</p>
      <p sl="es">Chile has been a source of protection and asylum for us in the past. For example, a large community of Basque people lives there, having emigrated to the area for economic reasons in the 19th century and for political reasons in the 20th century.</p>
      <p sl="es">That is why, in this case, words should be backed up by actions, and I am satisfied by the swift action taken by the European Union, which immediately sent EUR 3 million in aid in order to fund operations; I am also pleased by the reaction of the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, and I congratulate Commissioner Georgieva who acted swiftly and, as of yesterday, is in Chile providing encouragement and establishing what is needed on the ground there.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am satisfied by the way in which the new European Commission Humanitarian Aid civil protection system is operating, by the help provided by the European institutions, and by the collaboration that has been established through the different agencies.</p>
      <p sl="es">At times like these Europe has had, and continues to have, an opportunity to consolidate its leading role on the international stage, working directly with those affected and helping to coordinate the aid that is being organised from the Member States and from the regions.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would like to highlight President Bachelet’s actions, for she has demonstrated once again how politics should be conducted, displaying great humanity and working closely with Mr Piñera, who takes over as President today; I also wish to congratulate him for the exemplary way in which he has put politics to one side in order to rise to the challenge as his country needs.</p>
      <p sl="es">On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to express my solidarity, my support for all the operations being carried out, and my condolences to the families of the 528 people killed and all those missing, and to the people who have been left homeless.</p>
      <p sl="es">We recently visited the area on a pre-election observation mission for the delegation within the EU-Chile Joint Parliamentary Committee. We had an opportunity to observe the projects developing there and we saw that Chile is a model for economic and social development in the Southern Cone region.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by echoing what has been said by Mrs Muñiz and Mrs Bilbao, because I believe the first thing we need to do is show the European Union’s solidarity with the Chilean people and Chilean institutions, which are very well represented by President Bachelet and President-elect Piñera.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, I think it is also important to remember that, as is usually the case in these situations, natural disasters are indiscriminate and entirely oblivious to people’s wealth or poverty: they punish everyone equally. However, it is also clear that the poor suffer the most, and it is particularly difficult to rebuild poor areas.</p>
      <p sl="es">I therefore think it is important to consider not only the recovery and reconstruction measures needed after a disaster has occurred, but also, in many cases, to re-examine certain structural elements, and my question relates to that point. If I may, Commissioner, I would like to ask about a very specific matter relating to the Country Strategy Paper that the European Union has with Chile.</p>
      <p sl="es">Of the EUR 41 million earmarked for the 2007-2013 period, how much is going to be used specifically to strengthen infrastructure such as roads and transport? How much is going to be used to improve housing construction in order to ensure that, in the event of potential, unwelcome disasters in the future, people are better prepared for this kind of situation? Finally, what proportion of these resources has already been set aside for these purposes?</p>

      <p sl="pl">The earthquake in Chile has claimed several hundred victims, and over one and a half million people have lost their homes. Let us, however, show solidarity with Chile, today, and remember that the people there are still suffering from a lack of hygiene supplies and a lack of access to drinking water, as well as a lack of food, medicines and blankets. In addition, the people are being harassed by criminal groups, who are plundering abandoned shops and houses. We, as the European Union, must do all we can to prevent people who have lost all their belongings, and in many cases members of their family, from falling victim to thieves who prey on their suffering.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is good that we have decided to send EUR 3 million for the most immediate needs. We should, however, remember that there are still places in Chile which have not been reached by aid, because of the damage sustained to roads and bridges. The recent events in Chile and Haiti demonstrate that, as well as financial aid from the European Union, the mechanisms of giving aid to countries hit by disasters still need improvement.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Solidarity with Chile is a very beautiful thing, and it is good that the European Union is showing that solidarity. Let us remember, however, not to stop at just solidarity, but to support Chile in the future, too.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I wish you a speedy recovery. First of all I would like to express my solidarity with all those who have been affected by this natural disaster. Unfortunately, tragedies continue to happen because of large earthquakes. In situations like these, with widespread destruction of buildings and infrastructure, and with thousands killed, it is important to constantly improve coordination of civil protection and emergency authorities to avoid overlapping of efforts and wasted resources. The European Union intervened promptly in Chile but it needs to collaborate with local authorities to identify needs and to coordinate aid effectively.</p>
      <p sl="it">This morning’s press carried the news that half of the aid provided by the United Nations to Somalia has been stolen by local partners, by some UN officials and by Islamic militants. One aspect to consider, then, is transparency in the collection of public and private donations and the effectiveness of distribution of aid provided to populations. Generosity must not be betrayed and a strict system of controls needs to be put in place to prevent money being squandered or stolen, particularly when aid is sent to very distant countries whose institutions may be weakened by crises.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, our people will be heartened to hear that there has been positive action in helping the people of Chile. We have all been moved by their plight.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, today I want to address my remarks to more general issues around the humanitarian aid strategy. The European Commission is very proud to declare itself to be one of the world’s largest donors of humanitarian aid. Its mandate, it declares, is to save and preserve life, to find sanctuary for the displaced and to help the world ensure preparedness for natural disasters. These are truly worthy aspirations. However, it is not the Commission’s money that is being donated. It is British, German, French – it is in fact money from 27 nation states. In a time of economic crisis every single one of these nations should be recognised for their worthy efforts. Perhaps in their documents the Commission should reflect this and acknowledge the efforts of those who actually do make the sacrifices. It is not the political elite and apparatchiks of the Berlemont, but ordinary people from ordinary communities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst it is true that developing countries need aid, it is also true that they need our support in establishing and maintaining credible democratic structures. They need our help in building a strong and unfettered civic society. They also need our help – and, most importantly, our honesty – in pointing out the wrongdoing from political regimes that ensures that ordinary people continue to live in poverty and in need.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the recent huge, catastrophic earthquake in Chile, shortly after the disaster in Haiti, cost the lives of hundreds of people and caused massive damage to the structures of the country, especially in the area of Concepción.</p>
      <p sl="el">We need to stand by the victims and their families and make a frank declaration of solidarity. We need to stand by a country with which we have close and friendly ties and which is one of the strongest economies in the region and a development benchmark for neighbouring countries. This has been established within the framework of the Joint Parliamentary Committee.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would remind you that the European Union and Chile signed an association agreement which entered into force in 2005 and which provides for political and economic cooperation and joint action on a global scale. In addition, as already stated, the European Commission has adopted a six-year strategic development plan for Chile for 2007-2013, which makes provision for the take-up of Community resources by this Latin American country for regional and sectoral programmes being undertaken by the country’s recently-elected government.</p>
      <p sl="el">The immediate announcement of financial support and all the other things the Commission has mentioned today are encouraging. However, I want to emphasise that we need to facilitate the release of the resources earmarked under the aforementioned EU-Chile strategic framework as quickly as possible, so that the consequences of this recent earthquake on the country’s infrastructure and for the further development of the country can be addressed promptly.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the Chilean people, and that solidarity has also been expressed to the people of Haiti, Turkey and Peru, who have also suffered recent natural disasters.</p>
      <p sl="es">Solidarity is one of the European Union’s distinctive hallmarks, and we have to strengthen that solidarity with regard to the future.</p>
      <p sl="es">Fortunately, Chile is a country with a far-reaching capacity to respond in such times of natural disaster; however, large areas of the world do not have that same capacity.</p>
      <p sl="es">I would therefore like to mention the European strategy for humanitarian aid. Our response could be even more efficient; it could be faster and more effective, as long as we are moving in the right direction. Which is the right direction? Firstly, in my view we need greater coordination between Member States, their respective humanitarian agencies and the institutions of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, we need better coordination between the European Union and international humanitarian aid organisations, especially the United Nations.</p>
      <p sl="es">Thirdly, we need greater coordination between military and humanitarian actors. We have to maintain the safety of the civilian population and humanitarian groups while upholding the independence, neutrality and impartiality of humanitarian aid and respect for international law.</p>
      <p sl="es">As far as the European Union is concerned, in order for humanitarian aid and crisis response to be a fundamental component of our external action, we need more human and financial resources.</p>
      <p sl="es">We can take advantage of the Barnier report in order to establish a European volunteer corps and I would add, given that Commissioner Piebalgs is here, in order to strengthen and better coordinate the link between humanitarian aid and reconstruction and development policies.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I agree with everything that Mr Guerrero Salom has said in relation to our response. I have to say that I was initially shocked when I heard that what the European Union – Baroness Ashton – was going to donate was something in the region of EUR 3 million. EUR 3 million is nothing in terms of the consequences and the fallout and the devastation caused.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last time we were here – four weeks ago – we were discussing Haiti. This morning we are discussing the Xynthia storm in Europe, and we are also discussing the fallout from the Chilean earthquake disaster, which happened just over two weeks ago. Then you had the aftershock of 6.6, which in itself was absolutely devastating.</p>
      <p sl="en">The fallout is there. The consequences are there. The statistics are there. We are talking about 500 000 – half a million – houses destroyed. These have to be rebuilt, and that is where we come in with practical help. There are approximately 540 people dead, and the dead are still being exhumed from the ruins. That is a natural disaster in itself. But we are talking about an overall bill of EUR 22 billion. We really need to up our particular contribution in that regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">One of the selling points in relation to the Lisbon Treaty – and we know that in Ireland we rejected Lisbon I – was that we were going to have an immediate humanitarian response to natural disasters. I have to say that whether it be Haiti, southern Europe or from the point of view of the situation in Chile, we have not responded. I know it is early days, but we really need to get our act together. What we need above all else is practical help: (a) money, (b) clean water, (c) restore the electricity supply and (d) get the economy up and running as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, given the devastating consequences of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile, you have to concede to the mayor of Concepción that 24 hours is an eternity for anyone lying buried under rubble. Even though the authorities and the rescue services in this Latin American country are undoubtedly well set up for possible earthquakes, the help for the more than 2 million people affected did not get to all parts of the affected area early enough because of logistical problems. Troops who were already late in getting there were swamped by the chaos. The population was forced to flee to its rooftops and set up roadblocks not only out of fear of aftershocks but also out of fear of criminals. Chile may be prosperous enough to care for those affected by the earthquake by itself, but, thank goodness, it swallowed its pride and asked for help, including from the EU.</p>
      <p sl="de">There will be lessons that we, too, must learn from this, however, namely that in emergencies the veneer of civilisation soon peels and that 24 hours can be too long. In this spirit, emergency plans and the coordination of assistance efforts for emergencies should be made more effective, including within the EU.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we were all shocked by the scale of the natural and human catastrophe. Through the rapid mobilisation of ECHO’s emergency response system and the EU civil protection mechanism, we were able to offer coordinated and practical help soon after the earthquake struck.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have already mentioned, the assistance deployed or offered by a number of EU Member States was also important.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to the humanitarian and other actions I have described, it is worth mentioning that on Tuesday in Luxembourg the European Investment Bank and Chile – this was mentioned by an honourable Member – signed a framework agreement to enable the bank to operate in Chile.</p>
      <p sl="en">This development highlights the excellent state of relations between the European Union and Chile and our shared commitment to continuing to expand and deepen our partnership. It is also extremely well-timed because the EIB can be an additional tool for the European Union to work with Chile in the medium- to long-term reconstruction efforts that are already getting under way.</p>
      <p sl="en">Regarding the concrete question of the country strategy for Chile and the committed EUR 41 million. EUR 25 million was spent in the first tranche; EUR 15.6 million remains for the second. Normally this should be divided 50% for social cohesion, 50% for innovation and competition. We have offered to switch this to reconstruction under review. No requests yet from the Chilean authorities, but of course it could be directed under both headlines to reconstruction.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Chilean authorities have not yet made any specific requests for the European Union to help with reconstruction. As I mentioned, President Piñera takes office today. He will surely give top priority to assessing and quantifying the damage and planning the massive effort that will be needed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission stands ready to consider any request that may be forthcoming. As I mentioned earlier, the fact that the European Investment Bank will now be able to operate in Chile adds an additional instrument to choose from among those which are already at our disposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also worth recalling what was mentioned too by some of you, that Chile is a good example of development. It is actually a net creditor, unlike most Latin American countries. The outgoing Finance Minister last Friday highlighted the fact that, unlike during other tragedies that have befallen the Chilean people, this time they and the Chilean state have their own resources as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, to conclude, the European Union – the people, regions and countries of the Union – is standing shoulder to shoulder with Chile in the face of this disaster, and that is how it should be in a civilised and human world.</p>

      <p sl="es">Firstly, may I bring to mind the fact that we cannot support amendments tabled by a group that has sought to distance itself from the resolution as a whole, and that our commitment to all the political groups who have signed the resolution would not allow us to support a partial amendment of the document.</p>
      <p sl="es">Secondly, Amendment 2 tabled by the GUE/NGL Group is not in line with the position taken by the Spanish Presidency, which is looking to establish a consensus in the European Union in order to renew our framework for relations with Cuba, but not for a complete break with the Common Position, which is what the amendment was calling for.</p>

It is due to this fact that I welcomed the rapid process in which Parliament drafted a resolution on the topic, giving a clear indication to the commission and the council that the SET Plan is timely and important. If we are serious with our mission, it is evident that we need all forms of low-carbon technologies, including sustainable nuclear power. Therefore I am happy that we managed to delete the wording on recital i, which is yet another attempt to put nuclear in a light it nowadays does not deserve. This recital may have had negative implications on the concept of ‘sustainable low-carbon technologies’ suggesting that nuclear is not part of that. The fact however is that we in the EU cannot afford not to use it if we want to take climate change seriously. Until renewable energies really can deliver effective results and secure constant energy flow, it is such low-carbon technologies which we must rely on.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Investment in low-carbon technologies must be a priority, since it is one of the most effective ways to tackle climate change, preparing the EU for a green economy. Intelligent low-carbon solutions should therefore receive special attention, not least with regard to their Community funding, to achieve the environmental targets set by the EU for 2020.</p>

      <p sl="de">I abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution on ‘Investing in Low-Carbon Technologies’ as, although it contained a number of reasonable approaches, it supports the further development of nuclear energy, which is something that I reject due to the major risks associated with it. The motion for a resolution rightly points out that research has had too little funding hitherto. However, so that Europe remains competitive in respect of other global players, the funding of research projects must be massively expanded, especially in the field of the new energy sources. The development of new, low-carbon technologies in the energy sector will, I hope, not only safeguard the existing jobs in this field but will also create many additional highly qualified jobs. However, I believe that, in this respect, the investment should be made in the fields of solar energy and carbon capture and storage. Given the potential for grave consequences, the investments in nuclear energy must be re-thought and redeployed. This new policy direction in energy issues will also improve the security of energy supplies within the EU and institute a more robust independence from foreign suppliers.</p>

We consider that the concept of ‘sustainable nuclear energy’ is meaningless because, in the best of cases, it is possible to reduce the threat to the environment and to people’s health, and the risks of proliferation that stem from the development and use of nuclear energy, but not eliminate them.</p>

I believe that the European Union must show solidarity to those who suffer as a result of these natural disasters. They have hit regions in Portugal, western France, various regions in Spain, in particular the Canary Islands and Andalusia, as well as Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. In western France the storm caused the death of roughly 60 people and the disappearance of a number of people, not to mention the destruction of several thousand homes. The European Commission can provide financial support to the affected regions through the European Union’s Solidarity Fund. It is of paramount importance that there is a sense of solidarity between Member States in the event of major natural disasters. There must be coordination between the authorities at local, national and European level in their efforts to rebuild the affected areas. Effective prevention policies must not be overlooked either. We must ensure, both in this case and for the future, that European funds will reach the affected regions as quickly as possible in order to help those affected by natural disasters.</p>

The human and material consequences caused by the violence of these meteorological phenomena have left a deep impression on us MEPs. This explains the motion for a resolution on natural disasters voted on today in the European Parliament; it expresses our ‘deepest sympathy’ and ‘solidarity’ with the victims of the devastated regions. European solidarity must be reflected in financial terms by the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund and by means of other European-funded projects. However, when it comes to the Solidarity Fund, I must point out that the current regulation does not permit a sufficiently flexible and rapid response; the opportunity exists to amend this regulation, and it is now up to the European Council to make progress in this matter. I also voted in favour of the amendment supporting the proposal made by Mr Barnier in 2006 to create a European civil protection force.

However, on the same website I also came across a passage from the Book of Jeremiah: ‘So there is hope for your descendants, declares the Lord. Your children will return to their own land’.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome this cross-party resolution calling for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit held captive since 2006 by the military wing of Hamas. I agree with Gilad’s father, who has asked that his son’s case be addressed as a humanitarian issue and not be turned into a political football. In the cut and thrust of political debate we must never lose sight of the suffering of both Israeli and Palestinian families whose loved ones have been taken from them in this conflict.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Geneva Conventions must be respected by all sides. It is totally unacceptable that Gilad Shalit has been denied his rights as a prisoner of war to which the Goldstone Report categorically states he is entitled. His family have no information on the state of his health, either physical health or mental health.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, amongst the 7 200 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, also held in breach of the Geneva Conventions, 1 500 are held for an indefinite period and 13 have already served 25 years. Forty-four are children while 23 members of the Palestinian Legislative Council are detained in retaliation for the capture of Gilad Shalit. Again, Goldstone is clear: these detentions of PLC members are contrary to international law.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Staff Sergeant Gilad Shalit has now been held hostage by the Jihadi fanatics of Hamas for over three years. Hamas claims it is a legal actor observing the Geneva Conventions and therefore he is a prisoner of war, but Israel, in my view rightly, regards him as an abductee from the moment he was seized. Irrespective of his legal status and international law, he has been cruelly kept incommunicado in Gaza, deprived of any contact with the outside world and even denied Red Cross access, which the Geneva Conventions mandate. His family has no information about his well-being beyond one video and sporadic indication from Hamas that he is still alive and well.</p>
      <p sl="en">If Hamas has any claim to be taken seriously by the international community, it should at least now show unequivocally that the conditions of his incarceration adhere to international humanitarian laws.</p>

It is from this humanitarian perspective that we demand the immediate release of Gilad Shalit. Meanwhile, the minimum requirement is that the Red Cross and Shalit’s parents may be allowed to be in contact with him.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, yesterday I and other members attended a meeting at which Shalit’s father was present and I should like to say that it is impossible not to be affected by this family’s tragedy. That is why our position is that Gilad Shalit, a member of the Israeli armed forces arrested in Israeli territory on 24 June 2006, meets the criteria for him to be considered a prisoner-of-war under the Third Geneva Convention.</p>
      <p sl="el">As such, he should be given humanitarian treatment and be allowed to communicate. The International Red Cross should be allowed to visit him and his family should have every right to be informed of his situation and, of course, to visit him. At the same time, we express our belief and our desire that this person will be released.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, without wishing in any way to detract from what I have said so far, I believe that our position that this issue can be differentiated from a series of other Palestinians in gaol is somewhat apolitical. Their presence in these gaols is also a humanitarian issue. I believe that we are giving false hopes to this family if we think that, by focusing, as a Parliament, solely on the release of this particular person, for whom I repeat our demand that he be released, we shall achieve something.</p>
      <p sl="el">Is the fact that dozens of 16-year-old Palestinian children are in gaol not a humanitarian issue? How can you differentiate between these two issues? We cannot not mention the fact that Gaza itself – as someone said earlier that he is living in a hovel and indeed he is living in a hovel – that Gaza itself, I repeat, is an immense hovel. One-and-a-half million Palestinians living there are living in a collective hovel. There are 7 200 Palestinians in Israeli prisons; they include 270 children aged between 16 and 18 and 44 children below the age of 16. Seven hundred and fifty thousand Palestinians have been arrested and put in prison since 1967.</p>
      <p sl="el">So we are calling for the release of Shalit, but our position that we believe that this can be achieved by divorcing it from the overall picture in Palestine is apolitical.</p>
      <p sl="el">To close, I should like to add that the only area in the world with a minister for prisoners is Palestine. I would like to express once again our love and sympathy for the family and I trust that this problem will be resolved shortly.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, the resolution on Corporal Gilad Shalit, which we are examining today, supplements the many resolutions previously adopted by the European Parliament on the human rights situation in the Middle East.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Corporal Gilad Shalit, who has been held hostage for 1 355 days, must be released as soon as possible. We demand and we hope very sincerely that he will be released. The young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri, who has been detained by the Israeli authorities since 13 March 2005, must be released. The children imprisoned in Israel, in violation of the provisions of international law and the conventions on the rights of the child, must be released. The militants of the Non-Violent Popular Resistance Against the Occupation, such as Abdallah Abu Rahmah from Bil’in, must be released. The elected representatives, the members of the Palestinian Legislative Council – including Marwan Barghouti – must be released.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is time for the European Union to insist strongly that human rights and international law be respected in the Middle East. The solutions do not lie in one-upmanship, exercised under repressive and violent conditions, an example of which was the assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai, which we condemn, not least because it makes securing the release of Gilad Shalit even more difficult.</p>

      <p sl="ro">This is the second occasion in the last two weeks that I have spoken about Gilad Shalit in plenary, and I am pleased that the joint efforts made with my fellow Members have resulted in this resolution. ‘The case of Gilad Shalit’ demonstrates the particular concern the European Union has for the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Gilad’s rights, which are set out in the Geneva Convention, should not be made conditional upon the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Indeed, Gilad Shalit’s father Noam has repeatedly confirmed that neither he nor his family is involved in politics. They have not chosen to be in this situation at the moment. The ideal scenario for us Europeans would be two states coexisting in peace and security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Negotiations for Gilad’s release have been going on right since 2006 via different intermediaries, with, in actual fact, one highly controversial proposal being put forward for him to be handed over in exchange for 1 000 Palestinian prisoners.

      <p sl="cs">The case of Gilad Shalit has become a symbol of the endless desperation and frustration in the Middle East. This is true both for the people living there and for the international community, which is engaged there. Gilad Shalit is a hostage with a name, whose eventful fate we follow with sympathy and concern. The people of the Middle East are the nameless hostages of this never-ending conflict. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Or is there another hope for Gilad and all the other victims?</p>
      <p sl="cs">All of the standards of international law will not make up for what we hear so desperately little of in this conflict – an appeal for humaneness. To try and abandon the geopolitical view of the world, where human beings and their fates are manipulated like playing cards. To try and put ourselves in the position of the families of victims and of all innocent detainees and destitute people.</p>
      <p sl="cs">What then prevents the release of Gilad Shalit and all those whose guilt has not been established beyond doubt by the courts? Not to mention the encouragement of those who want to live in peace.The key to peace is trust, compromise and the courage to defend peace against all those who are implacable. I would like to ask you to take the first step.</p>

      <p sl="da">Mr President, the purpose of our debate today is, in all earnestness, to put a name and a face to human suffering, and in that way expand our compassion and our empathy. In this regard, it is very valuable indeed that we have chosen Gilad Shalit as a topic for our debate today. This will lead us to extend our empathy to others, so that we can identify with their suffering and their families’ suffering. There are thousands of Palestinians who are being detained under totally unacceptable conditions, something that is contrary to international rules in every respect, and that is just as difficult a situation for them as it is for Gilad Shalit and his family. We must do our utmost to take this problem seriously, and my feeling is that all of us in this House are prepared to do so. The issue here is not just one prisoner, but thousands of prisoners who are victims of this major conflict.</p>
      <p sl="da">I would also add a further point: it is important that we face up squarely to the cause of this suffering and that we realise that, if we do not do something, not only about the siege of Gaza, but also about the occupation of Palestine as a whole, and if we do not create a two-state solution which I believe all of us are calling for and want, there will be no future for these people. I think this is a really productive way to go about finding a common solution, and I hope that Baroness Ashton will put the EU in a position where it does not only have to pay, pay and pay, but where it can also make its voice heard every now and then.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, on 25 June 2006, an Israeli Army conscript, Corporal Gilad Shalit, was abducted following a terrorist infiltration from the Gaza Strip. He has since been held hostage by Hamas. Hamas has kept Shalit completely cut off from the outside world. He has been incarcerated in deepest darkness and not even the Red Cross is allowed access to him.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Shalit case proves once again that Europe and Israel are on the same side. Barbaric Islamic forces are waging an all-out war against Western civilisation. Israel is in the frontline of that war. In Israel and Europe, every human life counts. For Islamic terrorists, human life counts for nothing, or rather, one human life is worth a thousand lives, because Hamas is demanding that, in exchange for Shalit, Israel release 1000 prisoners, including a large number of terrorist murderers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is important that we obtain Shalit’s release, but without Israel having to release terrorists in return. After all, we have seen where exchanges like this have led in the past: the euphoria of victory for the terrorists, for their followers and leaders, and inevitably more terror. We cannot allow people to profit from terrorism, and it would be irresponsible if we encouraged Israel to respond to such hostage-taking with an exchange, because the next Hamas hostage could be somebody from Paris, Amsterdam or Brussels. And what kind of a position will we be in then?</p>
      <p sl="nl">The boot must be put on the other foot immediately: it is Hamas, not Israel, that must pay for taking Gilad Shalit, a European, hostage. The price should be so high that they release him of their own free will. In this regard, we ask that a complete ban on travel to and through Europe be imposed on all officials of the Hamas regime, including those who are not formally allied with Hamas and those who are not on the European terror list.</p>

I am encouraged by the wide support in the European Parliament for this debate and by the warm reception our colleagues expressed yesterday to Shalit’s father.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shalit’s case should not become a bargaining chip. Instead it will be in the interests of Hamas if they want to gain legitimacy in the peace process.

It is an organisation of Israeli and Palestinian families who have lost relatives in the conflict.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the case of the abducted Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, is of great concern to the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">My former colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner called urgently for Mr Shalit’s release in this very House already on 5 July 2006, less than two weeks after his capture. Over the years and on a number of occasions, including at the latest Association Council with Israel last June and in the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of December 2009, the EU has consistently called on those holding Mr Shalit to release him without delay. Therefore we join with today’s Parliament motions calling for his release.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is our opinion, in line with the assessment of many human rights organisations, that the terms and conditions of Mr Shalit’s detention are contrary to international humanitarian law. Therefore we urge his captors to respect such obligations and in particular to allow delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit him. Finally, we are aware that mediation activities have been ongoing, aimed at the release of Gilad Shalit. We encourage all efforts made in this direction and we express our hope that they will soon be successful. I will also personally pass on a clear message from you to my colleague Cathy Ashton.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, I would like to begin by saying that Mexico is a great democracy that has progressed steadily over the last 20 years. It is a friend of the European Union and we share a Strategic Partnership Agreement. I would also like to say that Mexico is currently waging a very difficult war against organised drug trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="es">Today in the European Parliament, however, we are talking about Mexico in the context of human rights, because there has been and continues to be a marked increase in violence, which affects Mexican people in particular, and because there have been repeated, serious complaints about human rights violations.</p>
      <p sl="es">The resolution that the major political groups are going to adopt here today is based on respect and consensus; of course, it recognises the situation I have just described and urges Mexico to continue on the path towards rule of law and full democracy.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, it also makes four important requests: it urges Mexico to ensure the right to a free press, because there have been attacks on journalists; to guarantee protection for the organisations that defend human rights, because those groups have been attacked and threatened; to guarantee protection for women who suffer violence, because many women have been murdered; and to avoid impunity and abuses of power by their police forces. This is what Parliament has asked of Mexico, in the spirit of friendship based on a favourable relationship with Mexico.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this week we are celebrating International Women’s Day. In this Parliament, we have seen a great many posters in all the languages of the European Union, saying that we can put a stop to violence against women. Today we are talking about violence in Mexico, and I think it is right that we should recognise that Mexican women, both indigenous and non-indigenous victims, receive the least protection from local and federal authorities.</p>
      <p sl="es">Mexican women are victims of all forms of violence, from domestic violence to sexual violence and torture carried out by the army or the police, and they also become murder victims. Regrettably, up to now the response from the Mexican authorities has been ineffective, which is why we can now accurately say that we are looking at a case of almost total impunity.</p>
      <p sl="es">Our resolution calls on the Mexican Government to fight against femicide, which is a harsh word, but an accurate one when we consider that almost all the murders involving female victims go unpunished. For example, during the past four years in Mexico, only 11% of the criminals who murdered almost 700 women have been sentenced.</p>
      <p sl="es">At the same time, it would appear that women are the judicial system’s favourite victims. There is no other way to explain how it was possible for two indigenous women, Alberta Alcántara and Teresa González, to be sentenced to 21 years in prison and to have now spent more than three years in jail for kidnapping six men from the Federal Investigations Agency – all by themselves – during an incident in a market. Let us hope that the judge, who will make a decision on the women’s appeal in one week’s time, realises how ridiculous and unjust the situation is.</p>
      <p sl="es">However, violence against women starts in the home. I hope that Mexican legislators will soon make improvements to the General Law on Women's Access to a Life Free of Violence so that the different forms of violence and the mechanisms implementing the laws can be properly defined. It would also be right to establish domestic violence and rape within marriage as criminal offences.</p>
      <p sl="es">Furthermore, in order for Mexican society to change and reject violence against women, it is important that schools deal with this issue as a basic matter of education for young people.</p>

      <p sl="pl">For several years now, the authorities in Mexico, including, first and foremost, President Felipe Calderón, have been waging a bloody war against drugs gangs. Over 40 000 soldiers have been involved in the war, and several successes have been achieved. These successes include, undoubtedly, the arrests of the bosses of the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels, the destruction of over 23 000 hectares of opium crops and 38 000 hectares of marihuana, the closures of over 50 illegal laboratories which were producing narcotics and the arrests of over 45 000 people who were involved with this process.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We need to be aware that the Mexican drugs cartels generate annual incomes of many billions of dollars, which is incomparably more than the amounts allocated by the Mexican Government to tackling the narcotics problem. So the gangs are spending huge sums on corrupting politicians, judges and police officers. This is precisely why the authorities are losing the war. Since 2006, almost 15 000 people have been killed, and over 6 000 of them have been killed since last October. Journalists are especially in danger, as over 60 have been killed, including, recently, Jorge Ochoa Martínez.</p>

To address this situation, the Government of President Felipe Calderón has adopted a tough stance in order to achieve its eradication: he has taken the decision to temporarily mobilise the armed forces, a move which has had a significant impact on the number of people arrested, the destruction of drugs and the confiscation of weapons. The army has accepted all the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission, including those concerning the investigation of complaints about their own conduct.</p>

      <p sl="fr">According to the Mexican NGOs and media, more than 6 500 murders attributable to drugs cartels have been recorded for 2009 alone, the vast majority of which were in the state of Chihuahua. President Calderón’s government has sent thousands of soldiers to the worst affected areas.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the images of the brutal use of violence on the open street in the so-called war on drugs in Mexico reach us regularly via the mass media. The murder of hundreds of women, mostly workers in the north of the country, is making headlines and has spawned the term ‘feminicide’. The European Parliament has produced its own report on this. Despite knowledge of the major increase in serious violations of human rights, the Mexican Government appears to be unable or unwilling to do anything about it. Pointing out the necessary relentlessness in the fight against drug dealers is no substitute for consistent government action. The major expansion of military presence and power, the competence of military courts for crimes committed by soldiers, the almost complete impunity – these are the real causes of the escalating violence in the country. Even the Mexican national human rights commission has repeatedly documented the increase in violent crime by the military.</p>
      <p sl="de">The government itself does not want to admit the situation. It also continually hushes up crime. Yesterday, for example, there was a story going around in the media that the Ministry of Defence had paid out an awful lot of money to the families of victims of violence in order to buy their silence. Who were the perpetrators? They were soldiers. The EU must address the fight against impunity in all its relations with Mexico. Given the severity of the human rights violations, it is absolutely necessary for the EU not to update the Global Agreement with Mexico. It must not do so until there has been a substantial improvement in the human rights situation in that country.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The escalation of violence in the Mexican states in the area bordering the United States, especially in Ciudad Juárez, is deeply worrying. The events of recent months have been particularly bloody, as the intervention of the federal authorities in this region has also been accompanied by a significant rise in the number of crimes related to drug trafficking. Therefore, the war against drug traffickers comes on top of a war between rival criminal gangs, resulting in a series of murders of exceptional brutality.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I believe that Mexico is an extreme case highlighting the entire difficulty in taking firm action against crime in order to safeguard national security. It is extremely important that we, here in the European Parliament, send a clear signal to support the efforts made by the Mexican Government aimed at eradicating crime, thereby improving the situation of the civilian population.</p>

We should, therefore, commend the Mexican authorities for their action, while at the same time, of course, pointing out that they should not throw out the baby with the bathwater, and that in this fight they should still try to respect human rights.

However, of course, we have been speaking, here, about journalists, and we have been speaking about other victims. It should be emphasised that these people should not be made the victims of discrimination.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Ladies and gentlemen, just this morning, the Mexican Trade Union of Electricians was surrounded by a police force of between 100 and 200 police officers. It is the same trade union that, after announcing a general strike, saw one of its leaders, Domingo Aguilar Vázquez, captured the next day on 16 March, and arrested on phony charges.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This attack on the freedom of trade unions in Mexico, conducted directly by the government, is even more shocking because we are talking here of the Mexican Federal Government not punishing crimes committed, for example, by their own military, or ineffectiveness in fighting drug trafficking.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Yes, the situation is complex. There are attacks by the armed forces on drug traffickers, but at the same time there are attacks against the trade unions. What happens is that, in a situation of ineffectiveness, impunity and rising authoritarianism, a democracy like the Mexican democracy spirals out of control.</p>
      <p sl="pt">This Parliament must vigorously condemn and, above all, call on the Mexican Government to finally stop being ineffective with regard to criminals and, apparently, so authoritarian with, for example, trade unions, workers and civil society movements.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I wish to highlight two issues in our resolution on Mexico.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Firstly, as we have heard, violence has been on the increase this year. Mexico is in the grip of large drug cartels and the violence they perpetrate is estimated to have cost 15 000 lives already. The situation is especially bad close to the border between Mexico and the United States of America. The Mexican Government is trying to bring the situation under control by means of a massive military and police operation. The strategy has also attracted a lot of criticism. Obviously, responsibility for the drug trade, money laundering and the problems these cause also extends to other countries, and Mexico needs to be offered assistance and cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Secondly, I want to mention recent reports by Amnesty International regarding the unwillingness on the part of authorities to protect human rights activists. Those who stand up for indigenous peoples and poor communities are at particular risk. When it becomes dangerous to promote human rights, many have to consider the risks of the work they do. Those on whose behalf the activists work then lose hope.</p>
      <p sl="fi">These matters, issues relating to the drug trade, and human rights must also be taken up for discussion in May, when we think about plans for cooperation at the next EU-Mexico Summit.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The Mexican Government must make a firm commitment to combating drug trafficking and respecting human rights and the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Drug trafficking has resulted in acts of violence ending in losses of human life. The cities of Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez featured among the ten most dangerous cities in the world in 2009. Since 2007, 15 000 murders have been committed in the war against drugs, with the figure in 2009 alone reaching 7 724.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Young people and women are hit hardest by the trafficking and consumption of drugs. In Mexico the economic crisis may turn into a social conflict, with poverty and the lack of education being among the factors which can determine that young people become victims of drug consumption. In Mexico in 2010, approximately 7.5 million young people have no chance of being registered in the formal education system, which also means no hope of making a decent living.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In conclusion, I would say that the dialogue between the European Union and Mexico needs to be stepped up with the aim of promoting economic and social development, as well as respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we often discuss dictatorships in this House. Mexico is not a dictatorship, but a democracy. We are debating individual cases of serious humans rights violations. For Mexico, that is not the key subject. The key subject is the fact that this large democracy, which is a strategic partner of ours, has been suffering from a serious, perhaps even fatal illness for decades.</p>
      <p sl="de">It therefore requires the right treatment and the right doctor. President Calderón and his comrades-in-arms are that doctor. That does not mean that they are capable of using, or allowed to use, every treatment there is, but we must support them.</p>
      <p sl="de">That is why I believe that paragraph 12 in the resolution, in which we state that we intend to make greater use of our financial instrument to reinforce good governance, the rule of law, the structures of a State under the rule of law against the disintegration of the State, against organised criminality, against that impunity, which has been quite rightly criticised, is so important. We cannot do that, however, by freezing or abandoning our contacts; rather, we must strengthen them.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, we are all concerned by the increase in violence in Ciudad Juarez, but I trust in the broad measures that the Mexican authorities have put in place in order to effectively tackle this complex situation. I also support the vigorous battle President Calderón is currently waging against drugs trafficking, which is a very serious global threat that concerns us all. That is why we should help the Mexican authorities in this difficult struggle.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, over the past 10 years, Mexico has gone through a very positive process of political and governmental modernisation. President Calderón is steadily promoting reforms. Mexico has also taken on greater international responsibilities and is playing an active role within, for example, the United Nations and the G-20.</p>
      <p sl="es">In this Parliament, within my modest capabilities, I have always supported the establishment of a strategic partnership between the European Union and Mexico, which we finally achieved in 2008. I hope we can adopt an ambitious joint action plan or programme at the May Summit in Madrid, because the European Union and Mexico need to work together in many areas, both on a bilateral level and in multilateral forums, in order to confront challenges and threats together, including drugs trafficking and other forms of organised crime</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mexico has long been a primary conduit into the world’s largest market for illegal narcotics, the United States. Mexico has therefore been scarred by the brutality and violence that go hand in hand with the drugs trade. Moreover, Mexico itself, as a country of 100 million people and a vital EU strategic partner, has increasingly – and sadly – become an important market for cocaine. The rising consumption by young people is especially worrying.</p>
      <p sl="en">Drug-related violence in Mexico only seems to be getting worse, with ever more grisly murders and journalists who report on such cases being themselves targeted. The prevalence of unemployment and poverty probably does not help either and induces a climate of lawlessness in parts of Mexico. President Calderón faces enormous challenges but he is determined to meet them head-on, and the EU should support him robustly. Particularly we should support his efforts to reform and restructure the police and criminal justice system in order to break up the corrupt links between the drug cartels and law enforcement. I believe he is also quite justified in the need to use the army as a temporary emergency measure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, an unprecedented rise in violence has created, within the country, a sense of deep insecurity amongst the population. The Commission is of course highly concerned at this situation. We know that the Mexican authorities are taking this seriously and have put in place a lot of measures to address the problem.</p>
      <p sl="en">President Calderón’s war on organised crime is its main priority. Apart from deploying a number of military across the country to fight organised crime, Mexico is making a tremendous effort to strengthen law enforcement and the judicial system.</p>
      <p sl="en">In August 2008, a package of security measures was adopted which aims at reorganising the Mexican law enforcement and justice system. The justice reform passed by the Mexican Congress in 2008 has the potential to address the main systemic problems facing criminal justice in Mexico, although we are aware that the implementation of this reform will require a long-term commitment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mexico is also making a very serious effort to respond to the concerns over human rights abuses, in particular the impact of organised crime groups and vested interests of freedom of the media and freedom of expression, which have been brought to the attention of the EU by civil society organisations. In this connection, the Mexican Government established a special prosecutor for crimes committed against journalists in 2006.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is making noticeable efforts in addressing other shortcomings, as seen in the approval of a federal law to eradicate violence against women and the appointment of a special prosecutor on this issue, and in the new federal law to combat trafficking in human beings.</p>
      <p sl="en">As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Mexico pledged to adopt a state policy on human rights and to remain open at international level with regard to human rights. The issue of the protection of human rights in the framework of the fight against organised crime and the integrity of human rights defenders are reflected in the recommendations accepted by Mexico as a result of its participation in the UN Universal Periodic Review.</p>
      <p sl="en">Mexico has shown interest and readiness in discussing with the European Union all these issues, most recently during the session of the EU-Mexico Joint Committee held in Brussels on 26-27 November 2009. Indeed, this area constitutes the subject of dedicated cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">On 3-4 December 2009, the EU and Mexico jointly organised an international seminar in Cancún on ‘The Legitimate Use of Force and the Protection of Human Rights’. The seminar provided a venue to hold expert consultations on a draft policy document on the human rights accountability of local police forces.</p>
      <p sl="en">The draft policy document was presented to the Quintana Roo local congress in the aftermath of the seminar. This initiative is complementary to the recently adopted federal law on the reform of the judiciary system and could be replicated by other federal states.</p>
      <p sl="en">We believe that the EU-Mexico Strategic Partnership provides the best framework for the EU to support Mexico in the areas of public security and the rule of law. The Strategic Partnership executive document currently under negotiation foresees the establishment of a formal EU-Mexico policy dialogue on security issues, as well as increased cooperation with relevant EU agencies such as CEPOL, Europol, Eurojust and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).</p>
      <p sl="en">From the Commission side, we are already supporting a project from 2004-2007 to strengthen the administration of justice in Mexico. Further cooperation in the field is foreseen for the period 2011-2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, it is clear that Mexico is facing important challenges in the areas of public security and respect for human rights. It is not easy and the situation is far from ideal, but it is also fair to say that it is showing willingness and determination to ensure the compatibility of an effective public security policy with respect for human rights. We will continue to support Mexico in its efforts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, after 13 years without an execution in South Korea, it is deeply sad that the Constitutional Court there ruled in favour of the death penalty a few weeks ago. The ruling states that the death penalty is a legal punishment that can deter crime for the public good. That is a commonly heard argument and merely a response to emotive situations in a given country at a certain time.</p>
      <p sl="en">It in fact means that the death penalty is being viewed as a preventive force in the hope that, when a criminal knows there is capital punishment, he or she will think twice about his or her acts. We all know that many studies have refuted that idea.</p>
      <p sl="en">Even more important is the fact that an execution is irreversible; there is no way back. Roman law at the time of Justinian stated that it was better for a guilty person to go unpunished than for an innocent person to be deprived of their life. That was 15 centuries ago. Since the South Korean Constitutional Court itself recognised that the death penalty could be subject to errors and abuse, our concerns brought forward today might strengthen the democratic institutions of the Republic of Korea in the idea that this method of punishment should be abolished for good.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the Republic of South Korea acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1990, and is a signatory to most of the major human rights treaties, moving backwards would be very harmful to its international reputation.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the European Union in general, and this Parliament in particular, has a very proud record – an honourable tradition – of opposing the death penalty. Therefore we can do nothing other than regret the decision of the Republic of Korea’s Constitutional Court that the death penalty is not a violation of that country’s Constitution.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I believe we have to keep the issue in proportion. The justices ruled by a narrow margin of five votes to four. The last time they voted it was seven votes to two. They did not urge or condone the use of the death penalty but called for a political decision for the Korean Parliament to decide on the future abolition of the death penalty in that country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also have to note that South Korea is de facto an abolitionist country. No executions have been carried out since February 1998 and, in 2007, Amnesty International categorised South Korea as a country that has virtually abolished capital punishment.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the seriousness of this issue comes back to the fore when we realise that the floor leader of the Grand National Party in Korea said just recently that this de facto moratorium on capital punishment should be ended and a swift execution should take place of certain prisoners. I hope this unfortunate opportunistic voice in Korea will be ignored and that South Korea will indeed move away from being a de facto moratorium country by changing its law and becoming a de jure moratorium country.</p>

This barbaric punishment by execution has no place in the modern world.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, the policy of abolishing the death penalty is a very successful part of European foreign policy. This can be seen in accession negotiations, in bilateral talks and also in the United Nations, where more and more States within the world community are deciding to come out in favour of a moratorium or to abolish the death penalty completely. Until recently, the Republic of South Korea was one of those States that, in practice, no longer applied this degrading and demeaning punishment.</p>
      <p sl="de">Today’s resolution is an expression of our concern that, with the decision of the South Korean Constitutional Court that executions are legally compatible with the constitution, a situation has now been brought about that truly facilitates the renewed use of the death penalty. We are therefore calling for the government of South Korea to do everything in its power, as an initial step, to adopt a legally binding moratorium that prohibits executions from taking place – there are, after all, over 55 people on death row – at which point, as a second step, the South Korea parliament should pass a law to abolish the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is very positive to see that within South Korean society, too, a movement has come about that is campaigning, ultimately, for the advent of a law to abolish the death penalty. We in this House should support that movement.</p>

Many arguments exist against the use of this means of administering justice. For me, the most important is its irreversibility. Whatever else might be said about it, capital punishment is a penalty which is final. It deprives people of that one most precious thing which they will ever possess. Besides, there remains the moral responsibility on those who carry out this act, because the risk always exists of executing an innocent person.</p>

I have not heard that anyone in Europe has criticised the Nuremberg Tribunal for its unjust judgments.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe is moving ever further away from the essence of a just punishment as a response proportionate to the wrong done by the perpetrator and the guilt incurred. When we talk about the murder, the killing, of many people, for example in an act of terrorism, or when we talk about genocide and the deaths of millions of people, and this is what has happened, after all, in Europe, then the question arises as to a proportional punishment. It is true that in academic circles, in Europe and elsewhere, a debate is, nevertheless, in progress on the effectiveness of this punishment in terms of its preventative action and the protection of innocent human beings. This, however, is probably not the key argument, here.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Europe has, today, abandoned the death sentence. This is a democratic choice, and we want this choice to be respected.

Firstly, because South Korea is a democratic country, and the ruling of the Constitutional Court is a ruling of a lawful body of that state. For this reason, there is no danger that the death penalty will be passed in political or trivial cases – it will be handed down to criminals and murderers. Secondly, capital punishment is a deterrent. It is not possible, of course, to prove this empirically, but if we assume the truth of the syllogism that a more serious punishment is a stronger deterrent, this means that the most severe punishment deters more, and this means that the death sentence deters most of all.

There are currently 57 convicts on death row awaiting execution. A critical view should be taken of the South Korean court’s ruling. South Korea, as an economic leader in the region, should in particular set an example on the matter of respecting the right to life of every individual.

Despite the fact that the last executions in South Korea took place in 1997, the court decided on 25 February that the death sentence is a form of punishment which does not violate the constitutional right to life. This is now the second ruling of the court with the same content. The first ruling was given in 1996, when the court stated that public opinion was not in favour of abolishing the death penalty.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the fight against the death penalty lies at the heart of the EU’s human rights policy. The EU considers that capital punishment is a cruel and inhuman punishment which fails to deter criminal behaviour, while the abolition of capital punishment contributes to the enhancement of human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have been able to welcome a number of recent positive developments in the fight against the death penalty. In January this year, Mongolia announced a moratorium on the death penalty. During 2009 Burundi, Togo and the US State of New Mexico all abolished the death penalty. In 2007 the UN General Assembly for the first time adopted a resolution calling on states to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty; a further resolution in 2008 reaffirmed this call.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this light, the EU was naturally disappointed at the judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Korea on 25 February – by a split vote of five to four – that the death penalty was in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We note, however, that this case revolved around the interpretation of the Korean Constitution; this was not a political decision on retention of the death penalty. We also particularly note the further views expressed by three of the five judges who found that the death penalty was in line with the Constitution. Judge Lee Kang-Kook and Judge Min Hyung-Ki made clear the need to limit the use of the death penalty and to reduce the number of crimes subject to capital punishment, while Judge Song Doo-hwan argued that any decision on the death penalty should be the subject of a public debate and action by the legislature.</p>
      <p sl="en">Although the courts continue to pass death sentences, the Republic of Korea has maintained a moratorium on executions since 1997. There is no indication at present that the judgment of the Constitutional Court will affect this moratorium. We welcome Korea’s determination to maintain the moratorium on the implementation of executions.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, as the UN General Assembly resolution has noted, a moratorium should be seen not as an end in itself but as a step on the path towards complete abolition. Accordingly, the EU urges the Korean National Assembly to take steps as quickly as possible to abolish the death penalty. The Republic of Korea has long been a regional leader on human rights issues in Asia. Abolition of the death penalty would thus only confirm the Republic of Korea’s commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">Congratulations to the South Korean Constitutional Court for upholding the death penalty. They intend to retain the death penalty for the worst criminal offenders. For example, for a Mr Kang Ho-soon, who has reportedly confessed to killing seven women. The Justice Ministry has recently released figures that show more than 60% support for the death penalty. If a similar question were asked in Britain it would produce at least the same result. In British prisons we have various assorted serial killers, rapists, child-murdering paedophiles, necrophiles and cannibals serving life sentences. The last example just last week was that of pervert Peter Chapman who lured an innocent 17-year-old victim, Ashleigh Hall, to her death and was sentenced to 35 years. This is an inadequate sentence. He and his kind should be executed. This would also save millions of pounds every year currently wasted on keeping such criminals in prison for life that could be better spent on the old and the sick. So well done South Korea: go on executing your worst criminals.</p>

      <p sl="en">‘Every person shall have the right to life. If not, the killer unwittingly achieves a final and perverse moral victory by making the state a killer too, thus reducing social abhorrence at the conscious extinction of human beings’ (Amnesty International, 1998). Morality, deterrence and fairness are key in the debate on the death penalty. The ‘crime control’ approach seeks repression of criminal conduct, while the ‘human rights/due process’ model emphasises individual rights. The former considers the death penalty moral because the defendant took a life (retribution), a deterrent because those who might kill refrain from doing so fearing for their life, while fairness is unimportant or unproven. The latter model claims that death penalty is immoral because the state should not take a life, is not a deterrent – as shown by statistics – and is unfairly administered, sometimes people on death row being innocent and their trials involving irregularities. I believe in the human rights model, as reflected by the international community in hard and soft law, and by the increasing number of countries abolishing the death penalty. I urge the Republic of Korea to show a clear political will abolishing the death penalty, and, until then, to immediately adopt a moratorium on its application.</p>

      <p sl="ro">EU guidelines on the death penalty date from 1998. This is the very year when the period of the unofficial moratorium on the death penalty started in South Korea. During this time, the South Korean Parliament has debated three proposals on abolishing the death penalty. Last month, the Constitutional Court in this country reaffirmed by a narrow majority the death penalty as being constitutional.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I deplore this decision and I hope that the Korean Parliament will introduce a resolution banning the death penalty.</p>
      <p sl="ro">If South Korea joined the ranks of the abolitionist countries, this would send a powerful signal to the whole Asian continent.</p>
