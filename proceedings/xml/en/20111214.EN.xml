      <p sl="unknown">Firstly, I have two distressing items of information. In Florence yesterday, a gunman shot and killed two people. It is highly likely that the crime was racially motivated. Yet again, people have died just because they wanted to live and work in Europe. This is both distressing and horrifying. We must firmly resist all manifestations of racism and xenophobia.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Yesterday, we also received sad news from Belgium. The tragedy in Liège struck at innocent, random people. On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to extend condolences to the families of the victims. We are with you in our thoughts and prayers. I think we have with us in the Chamber a fellow Member from Liège, Mathieu Grosch. No, unfortunately he is not here. Once again – we are with you in our thoughts and prayers.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission to begin the debate on the review of the Polish Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">I would like to give a very warm welcome to the Prime Minister of the Government of the Republic of Poland, who also heads the Presidency – the Presidency of the Council of the European Union – Mr Donald Tusk. Mr Tusk, to begin with, I would like to quote a part of the speech you made here five months ago, in July. It is part of what you said about the European Parliament. You said it is a place which, for ‘all Europeans who treat the idea of Europe seriously, is something special. It is a place which guarantees that the memory of where Europe has come from will be kept alive in our minds. In particular … it is an institution and a place which has never stopped believing in the reason for having a united Europe’. Nearly six months have passed, and the Polish Presidency is coming to an end. We have been conscious of your conviction that it is possible to work together with the European Parliament in the interests of the people who live in the European Union. We are very interested in your review, and in your opinion on what the past half-year has been like and what lessons the Polish Presidency has learned from this for the future. Mr Tusk, please take the floor.</p>

    <intervention id="3-011-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Donald Tusk" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President-in-Office of the Council">
      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, six months have passed since we met at the beginning of the Polish Presidency. On that occasion, I gave an assurance of the great importance which Poles attach, and which I personally attach, to the idea of a united Europe. I declared our attachment to the European Union, conscious of the fact that we were assuming the Presidency during a profound crisis. Not just a financial crisis, but – as we could already see then – also a crisis of confidence; while today, and I think we ought to say this unequivocally, it is perhaps also a crisis affecting our politics and the way we are governed.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Despite the fact that we were making our debut in the role of the Presidency, and perhaps precisely because of this, ours has been a Presidency of people determined to carry out their European assignment as well as we can. It is not just goodwill that we have invested in this Presidency, but also the efforts and the abilities of the hundreds of young Poles who have worked here in Strasbourg, in Brussels, in Warsaw and in many other places across Europe, and we have taken up the tasks – mindful of our limitations – which are the routine duty of every Presidency, including work on legislative matters. I will not give a list of everything we have done over these last six months.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I have heard many warm words in the last few days about our commitment and the effectiveness of our work. This may not sound very modest, but I do think the Poles have earned this praise, and they have done so precisely because it was with a belief in the reason for having a united Europe that they took on the challenges which fell to the Polish Presidency. Whether this was work on the ‘six-pack’, the accession of Croatia, the Eastern Partnership, energy security or other legislation, such as the single European patent, in all of these areas we have managed to achieve what we undertook to do and to complete our work. It was mainly because the Polish Presidency has been led by people who really do treat Europe seriously as a community and who – in spite of the crisis, or perhaps I should put that the other way round, precisely because we have been hit by the crisis, including the crisis of confidence – wanted to show that the responsibilities which rest with Europeans at such a time mean their commitment should be even more clear and unwavering.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I want to say that I would like to turn this review into a serious reflection in a political sense, a reflection which is the fruit of these six months of experience of the Polish Presidency, but I am sure that you, too, have reached similar conclusions and have a similar need to talk frankly about what is happening in Europe at the moment. This is because in spite of my satisfaction with the work which has been accomplished, I cannot say that Europe at the end of 2011 is a Europe which is more united than it was six months, a year or five years ago. Today, at the close of the Polish Presidency, I cannot say we have succeeded together in averting what may, in fact, be the most serious crisis to have afflicted our continent in the history of the united Europe. In fact, I would say quite the contrary. Today, we have to say very openly that we are at a parting of the ways. We face a very serious choice: during this crisis, and in looking for ways and means to exit the crisis, should we take the Community approach, and are we going to search for a European way to lift ourselves out of the crisis, or should we take the route of national and state egoism, looking selfishly for a way out on our own and considering the Union to be a burden rather than the best way for Europeans to overcome the crisis?</p>
      <p sl="pl">I want to remind you that the real source of the crisis, the financial crisis, was not the EU institutions. It was not in the European Parliament, the European Commission or other EU institutions that the crisis was born. European integration is not the source of the financial crisis, and so it is not the source of the political crisis either. These six months have shown with full force that it is exactly the opposite – that the crisis is feeding and growing fat on the threat of the Union falling apart, and that if today we cannot say we have succeeded in managing the crisis, it is because when responding to the crisis, Europe has not always acted as a community.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">Why are we also talking about a political crisis today? It is because too many people in Europe, too many politicians in Europe, want to persuade us and to persuade Europe that the way out of the crisis is to abandon our work together as a community. I would like to say, however, that in my opinion, and in that of the Polish Presidency, this is a symptom of a kind of illness. The current crisis is undermining the sense of community. If we are hearing opinions in Europe today about how we need to reconsider the bases and the foundations of the Union, this is very clearly a symptom that the crisis exists not just in our banks, but also in our hearts. The last European Council meeting showed very clearly that some of us are searching for tools not only to rescue the euro, but also, in the long term, to strengthen the Union, but that there are others who think that the way to rescue the euro or the financial situation of the Member States and the institutions is a relaxation of the Union, and its eventual destruction. I am not accusing anyone, because these are points of view which are equally entitled to exist. We are all entitled to have our own vision for the future of Europe, but we cannot hide the fact that today, somewhere beneath the surface, there is in fact now a debate going on not about the future of the euro, but about the future of the Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">At the last European Council meeting, we made decisions which are only a first step. Both in Brussels and in my own country, I have tried to persuade everyone that if we are not fully satisfied with this summit, it is because we have only taken a single step, and that we still continue to lack the single-minded determination necessary to take the next steps quickly and decisively acting as the Union and for the Union. When I hear some of the comments which are being made – they are, I am sure, being made in good faith, I am not accusing anyone of ill will – but when I hear comments full of satisfaction that Great Britain has become an island again and that the English Channel has suddenly become wider in comparison to several weeks ago, I have to say frankly that I do not understand this satisfaction.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">We may not accept the decisions of politicians of one or another country, but we must not make a public display of delight that the distance between the Member States is growing before our eyes – in this case, the distance between the United Kingdom and the European Union. However, I would also like to say that other comments have also been made, such as that one capital has won against other capitals. We know that Europe, not only during the current crisis, but also for the future, needs strong political leadership. At the last European Council meeting, and over the last six months, I have witnessed this great European dispute, which has not yet been given a specific title: is the political leadership of Europe going to be the result of cut-throat competition between nation-states, and is the result of this competition going to be the domination of one, two or three capitals over the others, or, on the contrary, is the political leadership of Europe going to be the leadership of the Union and is it going to be working for the good of the whole Union? It is very important that we should be able to sum up each further meeting with the conviction that the Union has won against egoism, and not that someone has won against someone else in a disintegrating Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to say after these six months that Europe needs to examine its conscience together. We must not point the finger today and say: ‘there is the source of the crisis’ or ‘oh, it is that poor country in the south which has made problems for all the rest of us’. We also need a shared responsibility for the future. Northern Europe, which boasts about its discipline, must also come to a better understanding of the need for solidarity. Southern Europe must also understand that shared responsibility also means more discipline. We also have to say very clearly that the source of the crisis, not only the financial crisis, but also the political crisis, is to be found in breaches of our mutual obligations, including those which result from the Treaties, and that these breaches are not a question of the last few months. We should all examine our consciences. Each one of us should think about when we started to violate what had been agreed under the Maastricht Treaty. Each of us should think about whether we are really ready to uphold the Schengen arrangements.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">We who are supporters of a truly integrated European Union have to say very clearly today that we need greater determination to protect the foundations of Europe, and not constant discussion of revision of these foundations. Therefore, I would like to conclude the Polish Presidency with an appeal to all the leaders of Europe without exception to undertake this effort to strengthen the Union, starting with themselves, and not to look for a way to break up, exclude or divide Europe. So today, let us say this yet again: we are for integration and against disintegration.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">We are against divisions into better and worse, and we want to see increasing political unity in Europe. We are for responsibility, shared responsibility, in the face of selfish irresponsibility. We are against exclusions, because the Union must also be based on solidarity at times when some of us are in a worse situation and others are in a better situation. We need genuine political leadership, because Europe deserves prompt decisions – decisions about the immediate financial crisis, but also about the future. The crisis has proved to be a great test of the EU’s fitness. We have to start a serious debate about greater political fitness for Europe. Other crises and other conflicts will arise in the future. This crisis has shown us – and it is indeed a good thing that this has happened – that the European Union does not always react quickly, because there is a lack of trust – so fundamental a factor – in the institutions we have established. We cannot allow this leadership to be a leadership of one, two or three Member States, not even the strongest of them. Neither can it be a leadership of technocrats, because they do not have a democratic mandate. This leadership has to be political in nature, it has to have a democratic mandate, and it has to be accepted by all, in order to be able to force everyone to meet their responsibilities. It has to be a leadership based on the European institutions.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to say that just as we need swift decisions in the next few hours, days and weeks to rescue the euro and stabilise the euro area, we also need honest and intensive discussion about a new political system for Europe. Not everyone accepts the EU order and we must not pretend any longer – today we do not know how to enforce the rules which we ourselves once set. Today, when it is convenient for us, we evade the responsibilities which the Treaties lay on us. So let us be honest with ourselves: we need a very profound and serious debate about a political system for Europe which will give us EU-based leadership. Therefore, the motto of our Presidency, ‘More Europe in Europe’, does, in fact, also have a political aspect. I think that the European Parliament is exactly the right place for this, and you should not allow anyone to deprive it of this clear historic and political mandate. This is the place that should become Europe’s constituent assembly. Nothing will be the same as it was before the crisis.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">The status quo from before the crisis is out of the question. It is certain that Europe will be different after the crisis. The question is only will it be divided or will it be more integrated? It certainly will not be the same. It is you who have the democratic mandate and you, I think, should take on this great responsibility, this great challenge, and therefore the European Parliament should become the modern constituent assembly for this re-emerging Europe – because another Europe, a new Europe, is emerging as we watch. Let us do everything for it to become a united Europe, not a divided Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">This profound reflection must not be window dressing, as has been the case in the past. We have had groups of ‘Wise Men’, we have had task groups and committees. Everyone knew this reflection had to be carried out to prepare for the future, but the framework of a new political order has never come into being, and the crisis has made this fully and very forcibly clear. It is not a matter of thousands and tens of thousands of new pieces of legislation; it is about restoring the balance between what belongs to the realm of the Member States and what belongs to that of the Union, and of rebuilding trust based on a number of clear rules – rules which we all accept and which we are able to enforce in the case of those who want to break them. This is a crucial task, and I think it also falls to the European Parliament as the modern constituent assembly which is building the framework of a new political order. It is not a matter of frightening each other – the crisis is frightening people enough already – but if we do not succeed in this task, future generations will curse not only the crisis, but us too. Either today we take up the struggle for the Europe of the future, or tomorrow we grieve for the Europe we have now. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thank you, Mr Tusk, for your speech and for your review of the work of the Polish Presidency, and, in particular, for your presentation of the most important work facing Europe in the future, and also of the work facing the European Parliament as a directly elected body representing 500 million Europeans.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Thank you very much once again, Prime Minister, President-in-Office of the Council.</p>

    <intervention id="3-014-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="José Manuel Barroso" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, honourable Members, I would like to begin by saying straight away that the Polish Presidency of the Council has delivered very significant achievements under very difficult circumstances. The Polish Presidency has worked with great professionalism and enthusiasm.</p>
      <p sl="en">Exactly 30 years after the introduction of martial law, Poland has shown during this Presidency its commitment to Europe, to democracy and to our common values. I am sure that everybody remembers Prime Minister Tusk’s inspiring speech here in this House six months ago. That speech came from the heart: a true act of faith in Europe and a strong appeal for more European integration. What you just said, Prime Minister and dear friend, about the Community spirit and the need to fight narrow national interests and egotism, and your support, without doubt, to strong European institutions is very inspiring and a great source of strength for us in these difficult times.</p>
      <p sl="en">Six months later, we can say that Poland has lived up to its reputation and the Polish Presidency to our expectations. The Polish Presidency has held up the spirit of partnership between the European institutions and the Member States. Poland has constantly pushed for more Europe to address efficiently a crisis that has not only a financial and economic dimension but also, above all, a political one. There is just, as Prime Minister Tusk mentioned, a problem of confidence and of trust.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me highlight some of the concrete points we worked on throughout the Presidency. First, a strong Europe: a more stable Europe that can withstand all kinds of weather. A Europe that can learn from its own mistakes and can also address its weaknesses, building its recovery on sound and sustainable foundations.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have laid the foundations on which any further reforms will be built. The adoption of the legislative package on strengthening economic governance – the ‘six-pack’ – has significantly reinforced the Stability and Growth Pact. It puts more emphasis on debt limitations and extends the Commission’s surveillance to macro-economic imbalances. Now we need to combine words with actions so that we can reinforce this stability culture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Yesterday, the ‘six-pack’ entered into force. It will put the Commission at the heart of ensuring fiscal discipline, in line with the position of this Parliament. We will accept this increased responsibility knowing that its democratic legitimacy derives precisely from this House. To complete this set of tools, we have come up with two Article 136 proposals on further strengthening economic governance, and more proposals will come to bring the new fiscal compact as much as possible into our existing Union framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">A strong Europe is also a Europe that is able to recreate the conditions for growth and job creation; as I said yesterday during the debate, we need stability, but we also need growth. That is why our 2012 Annual Growth Survey puts a strong emphasis on the need for implementation of growth-enhancing actions, and I welcome the support for our fast-track programme for measures with a significant impact on growth and jobs. This includes the proposals on the Single Market Act.</p>
      <p sl="en">During the Polish Presidency, we have taken key decisions to prepare the relaunch of economic growth, through the development and strengthening of the single market, notably on the e-economy. I would also like to mention the very good progress made in the negotiations on the unitary patent, which showed the energy and constructive approach needed. I call on the Member States quickly to resolve among themselves the one outstanding issue: the seat of the litigation court under the intergovernmental agreement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Growth is also about green growth, energy security and the fight against climate change, and we are moving forward on all these fronts. The Commission has already tabled proposals on completing the internal energy market, boosting energy efficiency, enhancing the coherence and coordination of our external energy policy and improving nuclear safety. Let me emphasise in particular the commitment of Poland to reinforcing the external dimension of the energy policy that has been adopted by the Energy Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the fight against climate change, Durban was certainly not a perfect agreement, but in the difficult circumstances, we can say that it achieved some important results; in spite of all the scepticism, it was possible to make progress, with all major emitters agreeing for the first time to have a new comprehensive and binding legal instrument, which will include limits on CO2 emissions. This was only possible because of the leadership from the European Union, and I am particularly proud of the role that the Commission has played in this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">We will now continue our efforts with our international partners to flesh out a new global climate agreement involving all countries as quickly as possible, and we will no doubt have a strong partner in this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Polish Presidency has also put a lot of energy into defending a united Europe, and you have just heard the inspiring words of Prime Minister Tusk. Together with the Commission, the Polish Presidency has been a strong advocate of the preservation of the coherence and the integrity of the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we need is more integration, not fragmentation. What we need is to consolidate our acquis and not to weaken what we have achieved over the last 60 years. What we need to do is to tap the full potential of the single market, not to damage it. What we need is more union, not a désunion .</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">This is exactly what the Community method guarantees. It enables us to join forces in the general interest. It reinforces our solidarity and our cohesion. Let me tell you very frankly that it was not insignificant that the discussions about the reinforcement of the euro area took place during the Polish Presidency, because Poland, whilst supporting very clearly a stronger economic governance of the eurozone, was also making clear that this stronger governance of the eurozone must not be to the detriment of the overall objectives of our Union. This was particularly important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I want to say the same thing regarding the next Presidency. We are, I hope, going to continue to conclude the negotiations for this new fiscal compact during the Danish Presidency of the Council. With the very constructive position taken by the Prime Minister of Denmark, I am hopeful that we can conclude these negotiations with a stronger euro area and stronger governance but, at the same time, also with a stronger Union, because that is exactly what we need.</p>
      <p sl="en">The last point I would like to make before concluding is about open Europe: united but also open Europe. Since the early days of European integration, our openness to the world and our attractiveness to our neighbours and to newcomers has always been one of our greatest strengths. Over these last six months, we have done a lot to advance our relations with our neighbours.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, good progress has been made with enlargement countries on the European integration of the Western Balkans. Last Friday, we were happy to witness the signature of the Accession Treaty of our 28th Member State – Croatia – which will join in July 2013. This should constitute an incentive for the rest of the region to keep to the path of European reforms.</p>
      <p sl="en">The successful summit with our Eastern neighbours hosted by the Polish Presidency in Warsaw confirmed our ambition to create the necessary conditions to accelerate political association and further economic integration between the European Union and interested partner countries within our enhanced neighbourhood policy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Association agreements are being negotiated with four of the six eastern partners and deep and comprehensive free trade areas with three of them. This Monday, we started further negotiations with Georgia and Moldova. I will be travelling to Kiev next Monday, as we seek to conclude an association agreement with Ukraine. This House has called for the conclusion of the negotiations by the end of the year. The Ukrainian authorities need, however, to demonstrate that they abide by the principles and values that underpin this agreement, namely, respect for democracy, the rule of law, human rights and judiciary independence.</p>
      <p sl="en">The establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy, an innovation also introduced by Poland, will greatly enrich the range of instruments at our disposal to support the process of democratisation and consolidate the aspirations of those fighting for freedom, including in places in our neighbourhood where democracy and rule of law needs to be encouraged.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I will travel to Warsaw tomorrow – once again – where I will participate in European Development Day, a Commission initiative, this time in cooperation with the Polish Presidency. This shows clearly that, even in times of crisis, the European Union does not forget about the need to show solidarity to developing countries and to the most poor of the world. As you remember, some time ago, when we had this enlargement, there were some suspicions in the developing world that the fact that Europe was enlarging showed that it conferred less interest and importance to the south of our planet. This did not happen; on the contrary, we are reinforcing our commitments to the developing world.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, these were considerable achievements under difficult circumstances. But this crisis is not behind us, and we have a lot of work ahead. As we move forward, I would like all Member States to show the same level of commitment to Europe as Poland has shown.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="en">The Polish Presidency will be a tough act to follow. The challenge ahead will now be with our Danish friends. In conclusion, let me very sincerely thank Prime Minister Tusk, all his team and his government, the team dedicated to the Presidency, for your leadership, your strong European commitment and your political courage. I think this was a great example for all the Member States which are committed to a stronger European union.</p>

    <intervention id="3-015-000" speaker_id="4342" name="Joseph Daul" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="fr">Presidents, Mr Tusk, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, rather than speaking myself, I simply wish to subscribe to your speech. At the end of the day, when it comes to speaking about Europe, your discourse is my discourse, it is ours, the discourse of our group, and indeed the discourse of many people within this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="fr">On 6 July, you gave us your vision of a Europe proud of its values, of its successes, of an inclusive Europe, of a Europe confident in its power to exercise its influence throughout the world. This is a vision that we share. Paradoxically, the current crisis may turn out to be a unique opportunity for Europeans to recover their enthusiasm, to bounce back, providing that we are able to adapt, providing that we are able to change our habits and the way we operate.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Prime Minister, you indeed have suffered, and you know what suffering is. The old Europe no longer knows what it is to suffer.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President-in-Office of the Council, with your government – I shall use just three of the examples that you have mentioned – you have helped to achieve, over your Presidency, the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance. The Polish Presidency, working in close collaboration with the European Parliament on an ambitious package for strong national public finance management, has shown that the Community method can be effective and can sit very well with the euro and the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Similarly, we can credit to this Presidency progress on the supervision of financial markets. More generally speaking, Poland has been working side by side with the European institutions to advance the notion whereby it is an advantage and a way out of the crisis to share economic sovereignty between the 17, the 17 plus and Poland. As you so rightly said, and as I said yesterday, we must put together a way out of the crisis for our fellow citizens for January/February.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Second example: the neighbourhood policy. The Polish Presidency has worked extremely energetically, both on the Eastern front, with the signing of the accession of Croatia, and with the launch, last September, of the Eastern Partnership, with the preparation of the association agreement with the Ukraine, and on the Mediterranean front, with European support for the current democratic process. I thank it for that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The third and final example is that in the field of law, the Polish Presidency has enabled considerable progress to be made both on the protection of patents and on European contract law. I hope that we will still be able to carry these through to completion under your Presidency. My group hopes that these efforts will be rewarded and that the final agreement will be signed in the days to come.</p>
      <p sl="fr">President-in-Office of the Council, the Polish Presidency has not just produced legislative texts. It has supported a principle dear to my parliamentary group and to the overwhelming majority of this Parliament, namely, the Community method. Indeed, your country, like all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, is more aware than any other country in Europe of the price of freedom, and the importance of solidarity. You have made effectiveness and respect for other people’s opinions a priority, without seeking to impose your own point of view. For many of our Member States, this is an example worth following. We are counting on you – for when you stand down from the Presidency, you will remain an influential member of the Council – to ensure that this Community method returns and is implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I shall finish this speech by inviting every one of you in this House to read attentively Minister Radek Sikorski’s Berlin speech. On 28 November, he reminded us that we Europeans are in the uncomfortable position of standing on the edge of a precipice. If we take action, we can emerge from this situation, if not, we shall plunge into the abyss. The Polish Presidency has helped us to take action together. We now need to continue resolutely along this path. I shall repeat a sentence from a very well-known Pole, John Paul II: ‘Have no fear’. Let us work along the lines that you described this morning.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I want to keep this brief. The Polish Presidency was, without doubt, one of the best that we have had in recent years. This is the 15th Presidency that I have experienced during my time as chair of my group. Let me repeat that: this was one of the best presidencies by far that I have experienced in these 15 six-month periods.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">That applies not only to you, Prime Minister, but, above all, to your government and to the officials that we have got to know here. I would add that there is a high degree of professionalism in this government. I compliment you on this, as do my colleagues. You are so good that you could easily be a Social Democrat, Mr Tusk. Unfortunately, you have chosen a different path.</p>
      <a text="(Heckling: It is still possible, he is only young)"/>
      <p sl="de">Historical mistakes can be rectified, Prime Minister, that is not a problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">There was another development during the Polish Presidency which gives me greater cause for concern and which you touched on. Prime Minister. You said that we are at a crossroads. That is indeed the case. We are at a crossroads, because we are about to lose the confidence of the people in the democratic institutions. Incidentally, this is not only happening in Europe, at European level, but also at national level. People are increasingly losing confidence in the ability of the national institutions to act. Why is that? It is because there is a dramatic process under way that is constantly gaining speed. The power of the financial markets is now so great that even governments of large states are submitting to it instead of endeavouring to use the democratic institutions in such a way as to get the financial markets under their control. However, a nation state cannot manage that because the financial markets operate on a global, supranational level. What has happened is that we are dealing with an economic and financial market system which, in the truest sense of the word, is driving a Ferrari, and the control, where it remains with the nation state, is trailing behind on a bicycle. That is our problem. We therefore need transnational institutions at European level that are capable of getting to grips with this problem.</p>
      <p sl="de">Defending the Community method involves nothing other than creating an instrument in the 21st century to deal with this economic development of the 21st century using the methods of this century and not those of the 19th century. That is what is meant by the Community method. Therefore, you said that we MEPs are the constituent assembly that has to bring that about. That is exactly how I see it, too. I would like to make it clear in this regard that I am not interested in another Treaty text. For every executive action that, due to the legal situation, reaches a limit in terms of no longer being able to control an economy that is coming apart at the seams, where this is the case, a parliament has to say: in that case, we will employ an alternative procedure for this executive action that is reaching its limits. Therefore, with regard to what we discussed here yesterday, namely, that this Parliament needs to have the courage to develop an alternative concept if the Council reaches its limits due to its complicated unanimity structure, I feel encouraged by you, Prime Minister, that this Parliament really must take exceptional measures, if necessary, even measures that go beyond the Treaty. The Council is also doing this, as we saw last weekend.</p>
      <p sl="de">Therefore, as regards the comment by Ms Merkel, you and others that we are the strong Parliament, the strong constituent assembly, we take that on board. However, we are also calling on you to make it clear in the Council that, regardless of what we do, it must be given legitimacy by the European Parliament. I then expect you to present what you have announced here to the Council. If the others do not follow you, exercise your right of veto and say that you will not participate until the European Parliament is strengthened.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr President, I have greatly exceeded my speaking time. I am aware of that and I apologise. However, I would just like to say two things very briefly. The first is to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Daul. He was re-elected yesterday with the support of 95% of his group and I am very pleased for him.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="de">The second is that this is almost certainly my last speech here in plenary as chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. I know that many will be pleased that this is indeed my last speech as chair of this group. I would like to thank all those who have always listened so attentively to me and apologise to those I have wronged, and to all those who think that I am a good Member of Parliament, I would say: give me your vote for the next term of office! Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Prime Minister, I am just an ordinary Member from a country outside the eurozone, but I am a true friend of Poland, Europe and the euro. My congratulations to Mr Daul. Before congratulating you, Mr Schulz, I will wait a bit.</p>
      <p sl="sv">Mr President, Mr Tusk, when you came to the European Parliament six months ago in your capacity as the Prime Minister of Poland and President-in-Office of the Council, we felt that you brought with you a more positive attitude towards the EU. It was as if someone had opened a window. It became easier to speak well of Europe. You did not mix domestic policy into the way that you managed the Polish Presidency. For that, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe would like to thank you and all of your colleagues, in particular, our friend Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, who is sitting next to you. Many thanks!</p>
      <p sl="sv">Poland has held the presidential baton during a very challenging and demanding six-month period. Europe is still battling the aftermath of the financial crisis. The task of keeping the EU together during this period has not been an easy one. Poland has fulfilled its task in an exemplary fashion. Keeping Europe together over the last few days has been very difficult. The summit last week produced several good results, but not entirely what we had hoped for.</p>
      <p sl="sv">When a Member State – hopefully only one – goes against the grain and demands that the status quo be maintained, it is gratifying that other Member States can and want to move forward, but, at the same time, it means that we now risk having a Europe that will be running in two different gears. The gap between the countries within the Euro Plus Pact and the extended euro area and those countries that are merely spectators is at risk of increasing further. This applies to a great many Member States, including my own.</p>
      <p sl="sv">I hope, Mr President, and here I would also like to address Mr Duff, that the Liberals can convince Mr Cameron and his reluctant colleagues in London that nationalism and isolation are not the way forward. In these circumstances, Poland has shown greater political courage and stronger loyalty to the European cooperation. The ALDE Group welcomes this. Other countries, like my own country of Sweden, could learn from your example.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Let me conclude by saying to the Prime Minister that we should not forget that it was only 30 years ago – as you, Mr President, commented on Monday – that Poland introduced martial law, yet today, Poland is one of the leading countries in a united Europe. I – and we in the Liberal Group – salute you, Prime Minister Tusk.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, I should first like to sincerely thank Mr Tusk, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, for his efforts during the euro crisis. This crisis has brought hard times, and I think that Mr Tusk, in particular through the speech he gave to this House on 6 July, with its very clearly personal historical perspective, highlighted just how important Europe is and made it clear that it is crucial for everybody that Europe is kept alive.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I also think that Mr Tusk and his government played a very positive role in the euro crisis during the Polish Presidency, and I would particularly stress the speech given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, at the right time, called on Germany to take the lead in solving the euro crisis. We are not afraid of a Germany that takes the lead too little; we want a Germany that takes the lead more. That was a very nice gesture, particularly coming from Poland, and it enabled us to see how we in Europe should solve the euro crisis. We strongly thank Mr Tusk and his cabinet for that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is another crisis, however: the climate crisis. This gives cause for considerable criticism of the Polish Presidency. It began with a sort of false start at the Environment Council meeting in June, at which a veto from the Polish Environment Minister prevented any conclusion being reached on the future of climate policy. In Durban, too, however, the Polish Presidency unfortunately failed to play a positive role. Its main focus seemed to be on maintaining the level of hot air, the surplus of emissions, instead of considering how we can take steps internationally.</p>
      <p sl="nl">It is, above all, thanks to the Commission, to Ms Hedegaard, that Europe played a positive role in Durban. The Polish Presidency really failed to hit the mark there. The Greens wonder why it is that the Poles do not see that you have to solve the climate crisis in conjunction with the euro crisis. We will not escape the euro crisis simply by making cuts. In order to escape the euro crisis, we must specifically invest in the future and in a green economy, that is, an economy that works again and that also solves the climate crisis.</p>
      <p sl="nl">That is the policy that we would like to have seen from the Polish Presidency. As the Polish Presidency, you called on Germany to take the lead in the euro crisis. Unfortunately, you failed to lead Europeans on the climate crisis. You therefore have our compliments on your handling of the euro crisis, but we have to give you an ‘unsatisfactory’ mark in relation to climate policy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Tusk, I would always like to be able to speak well in this Chamber of the work of the Polish Government and of the foreign policy which it pursues, but unfortunately, these six months of the Polish Presidency simply do not allow me that possibility. In my opinion, it has been a Presidency which was weak, unaspiring and short on ambition; a Presidency which, from the outset, accepted the very wrong assumption that Poland was only going to perform an administrative function in the European Union, and that we were not going to propose any ambitious goals, either for ourselves or for the European Union, such as those related to alignment of direct payments to EU farmers. We know that the disproportions are very great, and Poland, because it is an agricultural country, should have given particular attention to this matter. I regret that this has not happened.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish Presidency was also passive in relation to the crises which arose in recent months – the Arab Spring and the war in Libya. As you know, it was not Poland but France which organised the European summit on this matter. The financial crisis – it was not Poland but Germany which organised the European summit on this. The Eastern Partnership, and the summit about this which was held in Poland – a total disaster. The summit failed to produce a conclusion. Instead of brokering agreement on a conclusion of the Eastern Partnership summit in Poland, Polish diplomacy was engaged in an election campaign.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, there is something which is the last straw – last week’s European Union summit in Brussels, and Poland’s tacit agreement to proposals which defy common sense and logic and which mean that the poor, weak and cash-strapped Member States are going to contribute to the rescue of the euro area. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, this is a mistake. It is something which should not have happened. You should not have remained silent on this, Mr Tusk – as the leader of the Polish Presidency, you should have said a firm no. Our neighbours were expecting this, as were the new Member States. What was missing was your voice, a firm voice of opposition on this matter. However, to say no to the European Union requires courage, strength and determination. You need to be strong in defence of Polish interests, but you also need to be strong in defence of the interests of the new Member States. I say this with sadness and regret, but in your case, that determination and that courage were missing. Unfortunately, this is how the Polish Presidency, the last six months, and you, Mr Tusk, will be remembered.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the Polish Presidency helped to serve the interests of the European groups and to defend the bourgeois political system as the capitalist crisis and infighting between the imperialists within the European Union and in other imperialist centres worsened. It demonstrated merciless hostility towards the interests of the people, with the support of the other governments of the Member States of the European Union. It zealously pushed ahead with all the anti-grassroots decisions by the Council, the Commission, the governments and the political forces of capital: the EU 2020 strategy, reinforced economic governance, recent decisions by the European Council, the Stability Pact, enhanced fiscal austerity, work on the multiannual financial framework and a barrage of capitalist restructurings, causing painful consequences for the people and making their lives a living hell and, on the other hand, it introduced new privileges and a package of subsidies for the European monopolies and the financial system. It turned its back on decisions on the controlled bankruptcy of Greece, for which read the uncontrolled bankruptcy of the Greek working and grassroots classes, at the same time opening a Pandora’s box for bankruptcy to spread among the people of other Member States of the European Union, in order to rescue the profits of the plutocracy.</p>
      <p sl="el">The Polish Presidency was marked by the imperialist war by the US, the European Union and NATO against Libya. The risk of imperialist war, of a general conflagration at regional level, is gaining ground. The people should not shed their blood in the war for the monopolies’ interests. The Polish Government, with the able assistance of the outgoing President of the European Parliament, strengthened and escalated the anti-communist hysteria spearheaded by the European Union. Hardly a day passed without its organising some sort of outrageous slander against twentieth-century socialism, without its promoting the rewriting of history and the vulgar equation of fascism and communism. It is precisely this aspect of the activities of the Polish Presidency which illustrates the fear of all the bourgeois governments of the European Union …</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, we are coming to the end of the six-month Polish Presidency of the European Council, the priority of which was European integration as a source of growth which would deepen and complete the single market. The Presidency must be judged against the background of the worsening economic crisis at both global and European level. We all know that the European economy is standing on shifting sands, meaning that economic governance needs to be extended and the so-called markets, which have turned into the exterminators of economic life on this planet, need to be reined in.</p>
      <p sl="el">Two particularly important events during the Polish Presidency were the summits on 16 October and 8 December. The second has yet to prove if it will result in an intergovernmental compact on tight fiscal austerity in a bid to rescue the euro. Most probably, however, this compact will mark the chaotic breakdown of relations at summit level between the Member States, with disastrous repercussions for the future. The crisis exists, but Europe must also exist after the crisis. To close, I consider that the Polish Presidency was fairly successful.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Polish Presidency came at a very difficult time. The euro crisis, the problems relating to Greece and the general political and economic climate have created a situation in which the scope for implementing political ideas and desires was, and still is, limited. Despite this, or even because of it, this Presidency has been a successful one. In this regard, I would like to mention the work carried out during the 2012 budget process in particular. As a result of good preparation, knowledge of the facts and the good political judgment that is needed in difficult times, the Polish Presidency has excelled. Even if the result is a compromise that clearly cannot satisfy any side completely, the EU 2012 budget reflects a real policy that is appropriate for the circumstances and thus your achievement that, along with many others, we will remember in a positive light. In the last six months, you have presented yourselves here as Europeans. Thank you very much.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Tusk, it was here in the European Parliament – the scene of the visible part of the Polish Presidency – that the Presidency began, was carried on by your ministers, Mr Tusk, and is now coming to a close. It had ambitious priorities: a dynamic economy, a Union which is open to its neighbours and to new members, and a Union which enjoys military and energy security. I think experience has shown that this choice of priorities was correct, but it has also created very difficult conditions for them to be achieved. Changes have taken place in the Southern and Eastern Neighbourhoods and a severe financial crisis has arisen – a debt crisis and an economic crisis – in other words, a positive explosion outside, to the south, and an implosion inside. The Polish Presidency – and you personally, Mr Tusk – have held the helm of the European vessel with a steady hand and have not allowed that vessel to be cut in half.</p>
      <p sl="pl">New dilemmas have arisen – the first being the form of government of the European Union to emerge from the crisis: should there be greater European integration or more examples of intergovernmental egoism? The Polish Presidency has provided pertinent recommendations and the right diagnosis: ‘more Europe’. The second dilemma: how can we avoid divisions and a two-speed Europe? We began the Polish Presidency in a Union of 17 plus 10. We are ending it in a Union of 27 minus one. I think this is the most important outcome at the end of our Presidency. The objective has been to preserve unity and solidarity in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish Presidency is ending with the message that the right response to external and internal challenges is more of the Community method, more of the European Union and more responsibility in Europe. I think that in the forum of Europe, too, the motto of your home city of Gdańsk, Mr Tusk, has proved its worth: ‘Neither rashly, nor timidly’.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Tusk, it is true that the Polish Presidency did come at a difficult time, one which could even be described as being full of dramatic moments. Following on from the Hungarian Presidency and your predecessor Mr Orbán, you brought in, Mr Tusk, a fresh atmosphere, belief in the European project and even European enthusiasm. You also brought with you responsibility and an atmosphere of European solidarity. We have to agree that the Polish Presidency has been an active one, and that the Polish Presidency has played the role of a European Presidency. Hundreds of meetings have been held in working groups and committees and at conferences. It can be said quite simply that routine work has progressed with good results. On European matters, you have had the support, Mr Tusk, of the Left in Poland and also of the Left here in the European Parliament, and Mr Schulz’s speech is the best proof of this.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Presidency was initiated with a promise of great effort to regain confidence, improve cohesion and face up to the most important challenges by electing to adopt the Community approach. As time went on, it became apparent that this was a little less possible than had been expected. It became clear that the obstacle was the selfish attitude of national governments. I share the view of Mr Saryusz-Wolski that the success of the Presidency may turn out to be that we started with a Union of 17 plus 10, but that we will leave a European Union of 27 Member States. However, something which was missing from the Presidency, Mr Tusk, was the introduction of new initiatives to create new jobs, social policy on a European scale to increase the economic security of families, and also progress on the financial transaction tax and Eurobonds. In summary, there was goodwill, great effort has been made, and, as a result, there is much to be done. Could more have been done in six months? I do not think so.</p>

When you receive more praise from all the groups for your Presidency than I, like Mr Schulz, have ever heard in the 15 presidencies that I have had the good fortune to experience, then it is clear that the ‘P’ in Poland stands for ‘professional’. We would like to thank you for the work that you have done in that area. Unfortunately, a lot of what you have achieved in your Presidency has been overshadowed by the general focus of attention on the euro crisis and the debt crisis in Europe.</p>

In the preparations for the multiannual financial framework of the European Union, your Presidency involved Parliament at a very early stage for the first time.

That is important to us. We hope that the same thing will happen in future, too. In the areas of justice and home affairs, in which I have also been working for many years, you have achieved a significant amount of success in connection with combating child abuse as well as in other areas. I could say that you are concluding your Presidency with a results sheet of successful action that I would like to see followed in a similar way by other European states and companies.

Pride at the fact that Poland and someone from Poland have held the Presidency, disappointment at the results of the Presidency. Mr Tusk, you have had an exceptional opportunity to include an effective Presidency for Poland in a framework of effective measures for the whole of Europe, as your predecessors did for their countries. You could have initiated discussion on harmonisation of direct payments to farmers. There is no reason at all why, in future years, Polish farmers are to be given EUR 150 per hectare less than German farmers. Rural areas in Poland will lose billions of euro in coming years because of this. You could have proposed suspension or revocation of the climate package because of the crisis in Europe, a package which, in its present form, means that electricity prices in Poland are going to rise by 100% within eight to ten years. You could have initiated discussion on shale gas and made it the flywheel of European energy solidarity, guaranteeing the development of our country and energy security for Europe. You have not done any of these things. This will result in the loss of billions of euro for our country and the historical responsibility for this will fall on you. Instead of this, you have proposed a change in the architecture of Europe and a change in the rules – a departure from a Union of equal nations in favour of the dictate of the great powers, powers which your minister, in a peculiar expression of homage in Berlin, asked to give leadership in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I wanted to remember your Presidency as a great success for Poland in an equitable Europe.

I would be very pleased to recall any creative, new initiatives of the Polish Presidency, but both the ‘six-pack’ and the accession of Croatia were already decided before our Presidency. However, I will remind Ms Kolarska-Bobińska that an effective Presidency, as this was understood by France or Germany, for example, means precisely this: ensuring that measures which are interesting and good for your own country are included in the framework of measures for the whole of Europe. Does Ms Kolarska-Bobińska not remember that when Germany held the Presidency of the EU Council, it took care of one matter in particular – the Lisbon Treaty? Germany settled it then, in 2007. However, it has somehow strangely turned out that it is precisely Germany, as the most populated Member State, which has gained the most from the fact that we have abandoned the Nice rules, under which Germany had 29 votes compared, for example, to Poland’s 27 votes, in favour of the system of double majority voting, under which, as the Member State with the largest population, it has the highest number of votes today. Does Ms Kolarska-Bobińska not remember that when France held the Presidency in 2008, it included as many measures in the climate package as possible? It is, in fact, France which will earn the most from the fact that it is going to sell its nuclear reactors and move away from traditional technologies. In other words, it is possible to take care of your own affairs and include them in the framework of measures for the whole of Europe, and this is what I had expected from Mr Tusk.</p>

A week ago, the leaders of the European Union decided to adopt harsher measures to cut wages and pensions, to cut social spending and to cut spending on education. They decided to build a Europe in which democracy, rights, freedoms and grassroots and national sovereignty will have meaning when there are no elections in Germany, when there are no problems with the German and French banks’ balance sheets. Prime Minister, a short while ago, your Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he is more scared of German inertia and procrastination than of German might.

These changes have had no unfavourable impact whatsoever on the reliable work of the Polish administration in conducting the EU Presidency.

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I would like to think that the British press, like the press in the rest of Europe, particularly the press in Germany that has been particularly anti-British over the last number of days, would have had little or no impact on a Prime Minister who had to decide what was right for the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p sl="en">Can I also say that this House tends to put on its blinkers when someone disagrees with it. Difference can be good; it can be a force for good and can force others to look at other people’s views. It is not the United Kingdom that these institutions have to convince that the agreement that was made last week will work: it is the markets. The markets have so far failed to be impressed and the people of Europe will continue to suffer in the heat of the markets until these institutions show leadership.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I can only agree with all of those who have congratulated the Council Presidency. Not only were you an honest broker during a difficult time; you were also a European broker. That was very nice to see during these difficult times in which we are seeing political trends in a number of Member States that suggest to the people that it would be possible to achieve more alone than together. You focused on what unites us. It was also very refreshing to see that, with this clear European agenda, you also received the support of the people in Poland on domestic policy matters. That was not particularly easy in this context. Therefore, I have the highest respect for what you have achieved.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this six-month period, we were also able to get a few things under way in the area of financial market regulation. Allow me to highlight just one area in which I was able to join in the negotiations myself, namely, the question of the regulation of short selling and naked credit default swaps in connection with government bonds, where the Commission did not have the confidence to propose a stringent regulation and with regard to which all the Member States said that we would not succeed, and where, thanks to the Polish Presidency, we did succeed in imposing sanctions against a highly speculative instrument and, where necessary, prohibiting it, so that we could help to bring greater stability to the financial markets. I would particularly like to thank your Finance Minister and the Secretary of State, who got this off the ground during a difficult discussion process between Parliament and the Council. That is an example that shows that we can do something together in the interests of security and stability in Europe. I would like to express my sincere thanks for that.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Tusk, I would, of course, like to congratulate you, too, as well as your many colleagues with whom I personally have had very good discussions and have experienced excellent cooperation. However, you have received so much praise that I would also like to say a few words of criticism – beyond the nationalistic and pseudo-revolutionary argument that has been present here.</p>
      <p sl="de">Prime Minister, you said that many people are living in this Europe as though they were not in a community. You are absolutely right about that. That applies not only to Mr Cameron; we have also noticed this sometimes where Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are concerned, too. I do not know how often you or your colleagues had to wait outside the door because talks were going on behind closed doors in the belief that it is possible for a small group to impose something on the European Union. Perhaps, on occasion, you should have been more forceful and made it clear that Europe is a community and everyone must be involved in the talks, and the euro is also a common currency, even if not everyone has adopted it.</p>
      <p sl="de">My second point concerns Durban, which has already been mentioned. This disappointed us. All of the Members who came back were disappointed by the position taken by the Polish Presidency. I understand that you were in a difficult position as regards environmental and energy policy. However, I hope that we have a genuinely common environmental policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">As regards democracy, in some Member States of the European Union, we are seeing developments that are not very democratic. I have seen a picture of you appearing at the party congress with Viktor Orbán. I do not know what you said to Mr Orbán and whether you said that he could take the Polish democracy as an example – also a post-Communist country – and did not necessarily need to follow the Hungarian way of doing things.</p>
      <p sl="de">The last point I would like to mention concerns the growth strategy. We could perhaps have done with more initiatives in this regard. Nonetheless, I would like to thank you very much for your work. I hope that, as the Polish Prime Minister, you will continue to pursue many of these issues actively in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Tusk, I do not mean to insult you, Mr Tusk, because you do not deserve this. However, I do mean to criticise you, because this is something you do deserve. This is because I do not have the same conviction as you do that this Presidency has been such a good one, and because we know, for example, that the Polish Presidency has been criticised by Amnesty International for not having an effective policy on Belarus. Jacques Delors has said that it is being ignored. In contrast to Mr Siwiec, I consider the results of the Eastern Partnership summit to be insufficient and unsatisfactory. I think, too, that the recent summit in Brussels does not mean we are dealing with a dual-speed Europe but a Europe of two directions, Mr Tusk, and, in my opinion, you have chosen the wrong direction.</p>
      <p sl="pl">You have made a speech today, and Mr Schulz has said that, in fact, it was one which could please everybody, and he also said that you could be enrolled as a social-democrat. That is not a compliment, because you are a liberal conservative. You should have acted like a liberal democrat and you should have defended such values in Europe. I have the impression that the speech which you made was the kind of speech you might make if you were starting the Presidency, and not presenting a review of it. If you had made such a speech five months ago, I would have understood this. However, today you should have come with this document. Mr Tusk, this is the document entitled ‘Priorities of the Polish Presidency’. Three priorities. I thought you were going to give an account of these priorities, and that this is what your speech today was going to be about, and that you would give a presentation of what we have done in the Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Blue-card question. – Mr President, Mr Migalski, I would like to ask you, Mr Migalski, why you have not been listening carefully to what is being said about the Eastern Partnership by the leaders of the Eastern Partnership countries? Yesterday, President Saakashvili praised Poland for its initiative in the Eastern Partnership. The leaders of all the Eastern Partnership states have been praising Poland. Why do you say that Poland’s involvement in support for the opposition in Belarus is insufficient, when all opposition leaders in Belarus are saying that Poland is playing a leading role on this in Europe? Why are you criticising the Polish Presidency when all the Members of this Parliament – I mean fellow Members from other countries – are praising it?

      <p sl="pl">Blue-card answer. – Mr President, I will permit myself not to react to that last personal comment, as I think it was just something that slipped out unnecessarily. However, my main response is as follows: I say these things because I think for myself and because I prefer to listen to Amnesty International and its comments on the situation in Belarus. I prefer, too, to have my own opinion about the conclusions of the Eastern Partnership summit, because I can discern diplomatic language, as I did yesterday, for example, at what was actually an extremely pleasant and very successful Christmas reception. Besides, I spoke to President Saakashvili yesterday and I had the impression that we do understand what Georgia should be given and what the European Union should be doing about this. My short answer to your question, Mr Lisek – I think for myself; not everyone here thinks the same way as you.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, as we all know, the Polish Presidency started its term of office with grand intentions, and, indeed, Poland has performed its Council Presidency duties impeccably. As a point of criticism, however, we have to say that the last six-month period was dominated by the sovereign debt crisis, and in that respect, Poland has, of course, played a subordinate role simply because it is not part of the euro area. Without a doubt, the course of events was instead steered by France and Germany, whether in relation to the reform of the economic and monetary union or with regard to the stability mechanism. Even in the priority area of energy policy, no major successes could be achieved. Things have instead gone rather quiet with regard, in particular, to the EU-wide nuclear power plant stress test. That is not surprising, as Warsaw is still sticking to its nuclear power plant plans despite the impression left by Fukushima and Germany’s move away from nuclear power.</p>
      <p sl="de">At the climate change conference in Durban, it was probably also to be expected that a country holding the Presidency that has such a high level of CO2 emissions was unable to put all its efforts into promoting the ambitious EU climate targets. However, there is one area where we can be very thankful that the Polish ambitions did not bear fruit and that is the advancement of the accession of Turkey. Instead, that is once again a long way off.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Mr Tusk, Mr Barroso, of course, I shall say, like most of my fellow Members, that the Polish Presidency has been a success, and has worked effectively over a difficult period. However, contrary to what has just been said, perhaps the high point of this Presidency is the speech looking back over it that you have just given, Prime Minister.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You encouraged us with utmost lucidity and a sense of realism – let me remain within the atmosphere of yesterday evening’s Polish Christmas dinner – to examine our consciences. This is something that we do less and less. Everyone shows their satisfaction, self-satisfaction or indulges in self-praise while you, today, asked some hard questions. However, the European Parliament also needs to examine its conscience. It is not enough to demand greater powers, greater cooperation and greater presence. We, too, have to be capable of a rapid and effective response if we are to survive within our institutional environment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I think that we shall have the opportunity to do so over the next few days with the growth report. I happen to have been tasked with the own-initiative report and we are going to suggest that Parliament be allowed to intervene and make proposals in relation to the Commission’s proposals, either to support them or to suggest new approaches.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the logo of the Polish Presidency, which features different coloured upward-pointing arrows, was meant to show Poland as a modern and youthful country able to initiate positive change throughout Europe. In the six months of the Presidency, representatives of the Polish Government have endeavoured to demonstrate those qualities and to show the important role played in Europe by consistent action, solidarity among Member States and persistent pursuit of the objective in view. Comments regarding the Polish Presidency report that it was quiet but effective.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The most important points of the Polish programme to be completed were finalisation of the ‘six-pack’, organisation of the Eastern Partnership summit in Warsaw, salvage of at least two further years of the EU food programme and signing of the Accession Treaty with Croatia. Also completed successfully were talks on the European Protection Order in criminal cases and on the European digital agenda, whose basic priority concerns issues of digitalisation, access and protection of cultural heritage, in particular, in the context of development of the EU’s digital library, Europeana. For me – as rapporteur for the directive on permitted uses of orphan works, which was a priority for the Presidency – these matters were particularly important. In the last six months, it has also been possible to achieve progress on the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy and the Single European Patent, where negotiations which had been going on for over 30 years were brought to completion.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The Polish Presidency has not just been about political action, because it has also involved cultural activity. Over the last six months, an exceptionally varied cultural programme has been presented in Europe’s largest capitals and elsewhere, in an effort to introduce Europeans to Polish music, art and theatre.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, Mr Tusk, ladies and gentlemen, the Polish Presidency deserves praise for having stood its ground. Despite an extraordinary economic situation and, let me point this out as a Hungarian Member, by making good use of the legacy of the Hungarian Presidency, it followed through on its programme. It is a success that the ‘six-pack’ for the reinforcement of common economic governance finally entered into force. It is a success that the Accession Treaty of Croatia was signed a few days ago. And yes, the organisation of the Eastern Partnership summit is also a success. The Polish Presidency also mobilised considerable efforts in the field of energy policy. Granting the Commission an EU negotiating mandate in order to strengthen import competition is a step forward. EU action vis-à-vis third countries can thereby be made more efficient, which is in the common interest of 500 million European consumers.</p>
      <p sl="hu">The commencement of negotiations on the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline is another significant achievement, and could substantially improve supply security for the EU. Finally, we are still working at full intensity on implementing the single market, which could lead to a reduction in the differences between Member States’ energy markets. Ladies and gentlemen, these examples illustrate well that the successive Hungarian and Polish Presidencies have, by strengthening each other, achieved significant results in the past year. Thanks to these, Europe undoubtedly became stronger in 2011 in the areas mentioned.</p>

Presiding over the European Councils passed to the president of that body, and presiding over the Foreign Affairs Council has passed to the Vice-President/High Representative. Furthermore, presiding over finance policy has moved out of the hands of the rotating Presidency. It does still retain some function, but it seems that Member States are such unpredictable creatures that they cannot be left to run EU institutions without being guided by a professional. It will be interesting to see how long presiding over the remaining functions will be left in the hands of the Member State holding the rotating Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="es">It has made progress on sensitive issues such as child abuse, sexual exploitation and the right to information in legal proceedings, and it has brought to fruition an initiative of the Spanish Presidency aimed at protecting victims, the European Protection Order.</p>
      <p sl="es">Above all, however, it has driven forward two extremely complex packages of measures, making a real difference, in which ministers who are no longer in government, such as Minister Miller, were also closely involved: the asylum package and the migration package.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I followed this morning’s debate and I have to say to the Polish President that what emerged showed far greater consensus than dissent.</p>
      <p sl="it">I personally belong to the group of people who expressed consensus and I would like to underline a very important part of the Polish President’s speech which yesterday provoked very lively discussion: You said, with regret, that the intergovernmental approach tends to take precedence over the European Community approach.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European Community has not seen the kind of development that we imagined for some years now, and the intergovernmental approach – as President Barroso clearly explained yesterday – paralyses the momentum which EU law would otherwise have achieved over the past few years.</p>
      <p sl="it">The prevalence of EU law is at odds with an intergovernmental approach which fails to give rise to that hope, that potential in Europe, which you, as President for the past six months, have helped to create.</p>
      <p sl="it">Taking everything into account, we do not think the summit had either negative or positive conclusions, but left us with questions which will find answers in March. I think your Presidency has somehow prevented the fall of Europe, and we hope things will continue to develop in that vein in the year ahead.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, the Presidency of the Council is, of course, not just an event: it is a process. By definition, a rotating Presidency has to be integrated into that process, so it is true – as some of you said – that many of the achievements of the Polish Presidency were also the result of work done before, and we should recognise that.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the same time, it is also important to see what this Presidency of the Council will leave to the next Presidencies. There are important contributions in this direction that I would like to highlight, particularly in connection with the multiannual financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you will remember, the Commission presented the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020 at the end of June, just before the beginning of the Polish Presidency of the Council. The different proposals for a legal basis have now been approved and sent to the legislator.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to underline the contribution given to the debate by the Polish Presidency in advancing the files in the Council through the initiative of the conference on the multiannual financial framework between this Parliament, the national parliaments, the Member States and the Commission, and in keeping this House fully involved through the meetings between President Buzek, Prime Minister Tusk and myself, as well as the follow-up briefings on all meetings of the General Affairs Council. I hope that the next Presidencies will keep the same level of involvement of all the institutions. I want once again to reiterate that the Commission, Commissioner Lewandowski and I will give this file the highest priority.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another point – which was also highlighted by a Member of this Parliament, Mr Mario Mauro – is the Polish Presidency’s contribution to achieving an acceptable compromise on the programme of aid for the most vulnerable people. While I am not completely happy with this compromise, I think it was important to maintain this support for the most vulnerable people. I continue to think that it is unacceptable – and very hard to understand why – that some governments, given the situation of social emergency that we have today in Europe, are not ready to commit to more solidarity in times of crisis. We need to keep this commitment to the poorest of our continent.</p>
      <p sl="en">One point that was highlighted – above and beyond the various files – is what the Polish Presidency brought in terms of commitment to Europe. One very important and memorable contribution was its commitment to the European institutions. What we have said today, Prime Minister Tusk, regarding the European institutions and regarding this Parliament, is very important. I wish that all the Heads of Government could recognise the importance of this Parliament, as you do, because in fact, we need to reinforce European democracy, particularly now, when we are taking important decisions that touch upon the very important issue of the sovereignty of the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">For instance, the decisions that are now being taken in terms of fiscal responsibility touch on very sensitive issues of sovereignty. We have to complete those decisions on more integration with more democracy, both at national and at European level. Some people believe that democracy only exists at national level. They have not yet understood that in Europe, we also have a democracy, and that this Parliament is essential for this democracy. If someone believes that in the 21st century, democracy is only national, they have understood nothing about globalisation and about the 21st century.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why, to have these decisions in terms of more advanced integration, we need to reinforce democracy and to complete national democracy with European democracy. We must not set national parliaments against the European Parliament but, on the contrary, reinforce the idea of cooperation between the different levels of democracy. That is why, Prime Minister, what you said today regarding the role of the Community institutions, and the role of this Parliament, is very important.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope, in the discussions we will be having in the next months, that this message is understood: the need to complete the fiscal compact with this Parliament and with the national parliaments, so that we can indeed have a strong European democracy.</p>
      <p sl="en">If we do not have a strong European democracy – if some people believe that, because of so-called national sovereignty, we should not accept European democracy – what will happen is that the true sovereignty, the material sovereignty, will be left to the markets, to international priorities that nobody controls, without any kind of democratic scrutiny. That is why we have to create stronger European sovereignty to protect the democratic rights of our peoples.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, honourable Members, I would like once again to express my sincere thanks for six months of work together, and also for this debate today, both for the voices which have focused on the effort and the results of the Polish Presidency, but also for those voices which have expressed criticism. I and my team find satisfaction in being persuaded that the critical voices were in a clear minority, but I hope you will allow me to refer to some of them very explicitly. I would like to stress once again that what is most important is bold thinking and bold action for strengthening the Union. This is important not just from the point of view of the Polish Presidency, because it is a job for the next Presidency – and I have spoken about this with the Prime Minister of Denmark – as well as for future Presidencies and, in particular, for all the European institutions. It is also the most important effect of our debate today. In relation to this, I would like to accentuate very clearly that I do not agree with the words of one of my opponents, Mr Poręba, who said – and this may serve as a symbolic digest of this debate – in commenting on the last European Council, that ‘you need to have courage and a sense of self-respect to say no to the European Union’. That is an exact quotation. Well, I would like to say that today, you need to have courage, a sense of self-respect and imagination to say yes every day to the European Union.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">I also want to explain to you, Mr Poręba, that your criticism that the Polish Presidency was not the host of the meeting on Libya in March this year is inaccurate, because the Polish Presidency began on 1 July. It would have been very difficult for me to take the role of initiator and host of such a meeting at that time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">As for the kind but also at a certain point critical words about Durban which we heard from our friend, Mr Eickhout, from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: it is no secret that Poland is not at the forefront of the movement for climate protection. It is true that no one is perfect and not everyone is going to be ideal in a particular role, and this is understandable. I would ask for understanding here. In the case of Durban, just as with all other action for climate protection, but particularly when we are talking about matters such as those which were being decided in Durban, the Polish Presidency wanted most of all for Europe not to be isolated in its efforts for the adoption of pro-climate measures. We think – and I will always stress this – that climate protection measures constitute an absolute priority for the European Union, but they should not be naive measures, and they would have been naive if we had taken on challenges which were not global challenges, by which I mean if they were not being taken on by our partners from outside the European Union. This is why I do think we made a step forward in Durban. Once again, it was too small a step, but it was a step nonetheless: we managed to build a collective decision, not only within the Union, but on a global scale, and this was a step forward. You are right, Mr Eickhout, that it was inadequate, but I am hoping that in the future, it will be possible to build an agreement on climate not just within the European Union, but that we will be able to be increasingly effective in encouraging other countries to join us, including Russia, China, Brazil, India and the United States, so that we will not be alone in this effort, because if we try to do this alone, we will perhaps pay a price which is too high, particularly at this critical time.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am pleased, too, that mention has been made here of things which we have done but which I did not intend to mention. One speaker said I should have given a report on what we had planned to do. That report, please believe me, would be a long one. I think the Polish Presidency – this is testified to by what has been said here – has accomplished the specific tasks to which we committed ourselves, and we have done so in a way which has been truly effective and which has brought truly good results. I did not want to take up your time by giving a day-by-day or month-by-month account of all the efforts which have been crowned with success. I am pleased that one thing has been highlighted which for us, too, was very important – the protection of people who are excluded. Not just the protection of weaker Member States, but also the protection of people who are excluded – the weakest groups of people. Yes, one of our initiatives – and I am very enthusiastic about this issue – was the protection of children, not only from poverty, but the protection of children from violence and sexual abuse. I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those who have helped the Polish Presidency take that further clear step for the protection of children who have been the victims of such violence.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The same applies to the proposal concerning the scheme for food distribution to the most deprived persons. It has been possible, literally in the last few days, to achieve what the Polish Presidency wanted. This scheme is going to be in operation for the next two years, if I remember rightly, and it is something which is very important, too, during a crisis. I would like to thank everyone very warmly once again for their support and cooperation on these specific projects.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="pl">Please allow me to do one more thing as I close. I think it is understandable. I would like to thank the President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek. Yes, these six months have, in a certain sense, been six Polish months in the European Union. The head of Parliament, the Polish Presidency, but also – I think I can say this – that Polish pro-European optimism, which, in spite of the difficulties, in spite of the crisis, has been in evidence, both here in this Parliament and around us. I hope it will be possible to retain this pro-European optimism and energy, because they are going to be very much needed. They are perhaps the most important tools for a crisis. It may be they seem lightweight and hard to quantify, but they are perhaps the most important: energy, optimism, trust; and I hope everyone can have them. Thank you very much, Jerzy, for your help – we have always been able to count on you. I would also like to thank José Manuel. You have been a great friend of this Presidency, and truly without you, this Presidency would not have ended with such results. Thank you so much. Finally, I wish every success to the Danes, the Danish Prime Minister and the Danish Presidency. We will be at your service and at the service of all those who want to make Europe stronger. In this work, you will always be able to count on the Poles. Thank you.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">Thank you, Mr Tusk. The Polish Presidency, as can also be seen from the applause and sympathy it is receiving in the Chamber, has gained the respect of the European Parliament, of many countries and of many representatives of the European Union for precisely the attitude we have just seen expressed – an attitude which is exceptionally worthy of the European Union, one which fosters the further development of the Union and which also fosters the discovery of answers to the most important and most difficult questions which we face in the Union today. We have endeavoured to respond to these difficulties during this Presidency, and the Polish Government and the Polish Representation have helped us effectively in this. Naturally, I would like to thank you for the kind words you addressed to me, but it was the European Parliament which created the atmosphere and it is the European Parliament which gives strength to successive presidencies. It also gave – I am sure of this – great strength and energy to the Polish Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union took place in one of the most critical periods for the EU, when the terms ‘implosion’, ‘disintegration’ and ‘two-speed Europe’ have kept cropping up in the media. The many challenges that emerged demonstrated the commitment and dynamism of the Polish Presidency in deepening European integration in the face of certain Member States relapsing back into nationalism. Targets achieved by the Presidency in the area of transport included new guidelines on trans-European networks, the Connecting Europe Facility and the linking of these instruments with third countries, particularly our partners in the East. The first document on tourism was adopted, in which Parliament extolled the importance of this sector to Europe’s economy. Negotiations on the next financial framework and on post-2013 cohesion policy were also issues debated by this Presidency. However, it is in the economic sphere, in creating genuine European economic governance and in financial supervision, that Poland has played a prominent role during debate and negotiations with the Member States, notably on adopting the ‘six-pack’. In spite of its efforts, many of its objectives were not achieved. Nevertheless, the Polish Government’s efforts should be stressed.</p>

      <p sl="sk">When the EU Presidency was held by the first two countries from the Visegrád Group – the Czech Republic and Hungary – I kept my fingers crossed for them. Unfortunately, their presidencies did not avoid problems which tainted their successes. Despite the escalating crisis, however, the Polish Presidency has been an unambiguous success story. Many people were surprised that, in a time of crisis, with national egoisms coming to the fore, the Poles have been demonstrably pro-European. One proof of this was the recent speech by Polish Foreign Minister Radoslav Sikorski in Germany. I believe it will go down in history as the speech of a statesman calling for a federal Europe. He directly addressed German politicians and graphically described to them the danger threatening the EU if it is not united. I would like to applaud the Poles for having the courage to talk about a common budgetary, immigration and foreign policy. Another important point I would like to underline from Mr Sikorski’s speech is that the crisis in the EU was decidedly not caused by the expansion eastwards. Although I do not agree with the Polish minister about the cause of the crisis – in his view, it was the lack of budgetary discipline, and in my view it was macro-economic imbalances – I applaud him for tackling the myths that prevail in certain sections of society in our western neighbours. I believe the Polish Presidency will set an example to all of the ones that follow, and that the Council will thus become a much more pro-European institution. I would once again like to thank the Polish representatives.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am especially grateful to the Polish Presidency for its commitment to the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region. Probably for the first time, the Polish Government presented, before its Presidency, detailed plans on how to coordinate and enforce further implementation of the EU SBSR. I invite the Polish Presidency to encourage the other two members of the Presidency trio, especially Denmark, to continue their commitment. It is important to better coordinate the implementation of the first EU macro-regional strategy both by the EU Council and the Commission. One other option will be a rotating Presidency, on the basis of which each of the eight Baltic Sea Member States would take responsibility for a certain period for the coordination of the strategy with the aim of achieving added value and concentrating on synergy and regional projects instead of splitting the projects between nationally-orientated shopping lists. Poland has achieved, with honour, one of its major goals, announced in July. The accession negotiations with Croatia have been concluded successfully and on time. Against the background of continuing economic crisis, the prospect of Croatia soon becoming the 28th Member State sends a message of hope to the other Balkan countries as to the continuing enlargement process.</p>

The crisis in the euro area has now lasted for over 700 days and during our Presidency, we entered one of its most difficult phases.

We still have more questions than answers, but it has proved possible to resist the Franco-German Directory.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Thanks to Polish efforts, too, the Union has not split into the countries of the euro area and the rest. It continues as a structure of ‘27 minus’, or 27 Member States minus the United Kingdom. Before the Presidency, Poland was known in Europe chiefly as a country which was receiving a great deal of money from European funds and was against action to fight climate change.

It was also at that time that I requested that the Polish Presidency pay attention to people with disabilities. During the previous Presidency trio (Spain-Belgium-Hungary), this issue had special priority. My concerns were sadly not unfounded, as the Polish Presidency did not continue the work previously started in this field. To me, this is unacceptable. I hope that the Danish Presidency will right this deficiency. I believe that 80 million disabled people deserve to be treated as a special priority by any Presidency.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is good that the Polish Presidency came just at this difficult time of crisis and weakening of the unity of the EU, because it is Poland which has the greatest experience in fighting a crisis by making profound political, organisational and structural reforms. This experience, this approach and the courage to make reforms are needed today in Europe. The Community spirit referred to by Mr Barroso is an interesting combination of ideas. Yes, we need spirit and we need a sense of community. It is a formulation which expresses the need of the present time in Europe, but let us remember that this Community spirit is needed most of all by many national governments, because only then will it spread to society in the Member States. Creating unity in Europe is a complex social and economic process, because Europe was and still is characterised by a high degree of differentiation.</p>
      <p sl="pl">For our reforms to be effective, it is necessary to identify accurately the causes of the crisis and analyse the effects of the processes of globalisation and the mistakes we have made at EU and national level. I will give just one example. Why did we not keep to the Stability and Growth Pact, which, after all, has applied to all Member States for many years? Who broke it? Why was the economic system in the Member States not monitored? Who is responsible for these errors?</p>

      <p sl="pl">I am pleased to be able to add my voice to the expressions of esteem for the Polish Presidency. Among the many successes to which reference has been made here today, mention must also be made of two events which relate to the area of my closest interests: completion of work and adoption of the directive on the European Protection Order and the directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. I commend these achievements, because for many people, the European Protection Order is not just the assurance of a uniform level of security as part of the free movement of people within the European Union, but is, above all, the chance to go to another country and live a normal life without being afraid, while the protection of children – the most vulnerable of people – from that repulsive and highly injurious form of abuse which is of a sexual nature is, I think, a matter of great importance to us all. For this reason, the value of this instrument for legal protection is beyond dispute.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I am also optimistic in relation to the words of Mr Tusk about shared European values. Particularly at such a difficult time, it is important to be clear in declaring support for a shared future for Europe and to take the necessary action which results consistently from this declaration. I think the Polish Presidency has shown the right course for further action and for how the European Union should operate, and I hope that during future presidencies, this course will be continued, thanks to which we will be able to overcome the economic crisis.</p>

In September, we reached an agreement on the legislative ‘six-pack’ that serves for the deepening of EU economic governance. In December, the Accession Treaty of Croatia was signed, and a decision was adopted on the commencement of accession negotiations with Montenegro in the following year. I hope that in February, we will see a decision granting candidate status to Serbia as well. The Polish Presidency has been able to use the excellent professional preparatory work of the Hungarian EU Presidency as the foundation of its achievements. The Hungarian Presidency managed to reach a consensus on almost every aspect of economic governance, and it was also during the Hungarian Presidency that Croatia’s accession negotiations were concluded. With Hungary, it was the professional work that was successful, whereas the Poles demonstrated a clear commitment to the European Union. They did not make eurosceptic statements as Viktor Orbán did on multiple occasions. While the Polish Government aimed at national consensus in respect of the EU Presidency, a willingness to cooperate that could also be observed at Brussels fora, the Hungarian Government chose its term of EU Presidency to adopt a media law that restricts the freedom of speech and a new one-party basic law that prejudices the rule of law.

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: Draft scoreboard for the surveillance of macro-economic imbalances (Ο-000306/2011 – Β7-0670/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-071-000" speaker_id="33570" name="Sharon Bowles" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="author">
      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the Commission for having given Parliament time to express its views on the draft scoreboard. The relevant recital of the regulation specifies that the Commission should seek comments from the competent committee of the Parliament before adopting the scoreboard. This oral question, with the accompanying motion for a resolution, is the response to this consultation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, Parliament has been very engaged on this topic. There was a very protracted debate in Parliament, and with the Council, in order to reach the final text in codecision on the ‘six-pack’, so this is a very sensitive subject for us. The scoreboard is an important tool for observing potential imbalances, even though the definitive measures are in any subsequent in-depth studies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Parliament attached a high importance to the indicators having both upper and lower thresholds where appropriate, and envisaged this form of comparison as useful. In the draft, this is not the case for most of the indicators. Of course, it is not always appropriate to have both thresholds, but the working document does not explain the reasoning why there are not both in the majority of instances, and it would be helpful to have elaboration on that.</p>
      <p sl="en">The issue of current account surpluses was also a matter contained in the Commission declaration. In particular, it said ‘macro-economic surveillance covers countries with current account deficits and surpluses, with appropriate differentiation as regards the urgency of policy responses and the type of corrective actions required’.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now of course the EU is not a closed economy – and it is very important that it is not – but, with regard to one another, we need to aim for better balance within a framework of promoting competitiveness. It is also noted that the Commission working document refers to available economic literature, but no references are given. We consider that references, and a more complete explanation of the methodology, are appropriate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Spill-over effects were also a significant part of our discussion and one of the objectives of budgetary coordination, and so we ask how the Commission intends to deal with spill-over effects in the scoreboard.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is reasonable to consider the scoreboard as a ‘work in progress’, and it is noted that by the end of 2012, it is intended to set a new set of thresholds relating to financial sector indicators. There is clearly a potential relationship here with the European Systemic Risk Board dashboard indicators. For my part, I suggest that domestic SIFIs may be one area to look at for inclusion in the macro-economic scoreboard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also with regard to work in progress, not all of the elements specified for economic reading of the scoreboard in Article 4 have yet been taken into account. We look for all of these to be included in the economic reading of the scoreboard, most notably in relation to employment, drivers of productivity and the role of energy.</p>
      <p sl="en">And now, more generally, how does the Commission intend to implement the scoreboard as part of the agreed regulation on the prevention and correction of macro-economic imbalances? In particular, how does it intend to implement the assessment of Member States showing large account deficits or surpluses as part of the annual alert mechanism report? What measures will the Commission take to make sure that it has timely statistics of the highest quality for inclusion in the scoreboard and its economic reading?</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, and as must be evident from what I have said concerning literature references and methodology, I would like to stress that a transparent implementation of this new policy instrument is of utmost importance throughout the procedure. Therefore, I urge in this respect that the Commission ensures that any updates or reports on the functioning of this instrument are formally addressed both to the European Parliament and to the Council, and on an equal basis.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, now that the legislation for reinforced economic governance, the ‘six-pack’, has entered into force – which it did yesterday – we must hasten its implementation. On the fiscal side, this is already a work in rapid and serious progress. On the macro side, we need to move on as well. I therefore welcome your draft resolution on the envisaged design of the scoreboard for the surveillance of macro-economic imbalances as well as your oral question, which in fact consists of nine questions, to which I shall try to respond in my remaining two minutes and seven seconds.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following your resolution tomorrow, and as the Commission received the views of the Council and the European Systemic Risk Board respectively in November, we can now finalise the design of the scoreboard without any further delay, and in full compliance with democratic principles.</p>
      <p sl="en">The final scoreboard will become part of the alert mechanism report, which is currently scheduled for adoption by mid-January. It will be discussed in Ecofin and the Euro Group in January/February. Taking due account of these discussions, the Commission will launch in-depth reviews of the Member States for which they are needed. These in-depth reviews will analyse macro-economic imbalances and provide the basis for any recommendations to be addressed to Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me underline the key difference between fiscal and macro-economic surveillance, and between the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Excessive Imbalance Procedure: both are preventive, but macro-economic surveillance is even more preventive than fiscal surveillance and, as such, is necessary for economic stability and fiscal sustainability. This we have seen, for instance, in the cases of Ireland or Spain, both of which had sound public finances prior to the crisis. Once the crisis hit with its full force, however, their serious macro-economic imbalances led to a very serious fiscal crisis which then turned into a recession in the real economy and led to high unemployment, with very serious social and human consequences. Moreover, while fiscal surveillance is highly numerical and quantifiable, macro-economic surveillance requires a thorough economic reading and is much more qualitative.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that, when we propose countries for an in-depth study, it will not imply that they face an imminent crisis. Instead, it means that for these countries, there is a risk of imbalances which, if confirmed, would clearly need to be addressed effectively. In other words, it serves as an essential early-warning system and a strong call for pre-emptive action to correct the build up of those imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">This brings me to the further aspects of your oral question, especially the regulation’s equal application to all Member States. The assessment of Member States’ current account balances is an essential element of the economic analysis of the alert mechanism report. The Commission stands fully by its declaration to the European Parliament on 28 September, stating that ‘macro-economic surveillance covers countries with current account deficits and surpluses with appropriate differentiation as regards the urgency of policy responses and the type of corrective actions required’.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, let me also recall that all 27 Member States will be subject to surveillance. Thus, all Member States will benefit from its findings, both on their own account and jointly for the common good of the European Union. I am certain that the United Kingdom will also want to participate in this work; we, for our part, want to – and indeed will – involve each and every Member State of the European Union. The regulation applies to all and we continue to work for the benefit of each and every Member State and the whole European Union, even though that sometimes seems to be forgotten in the midst of the most heated debates of the day.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, here in this House, we have been grappling with the subject of economic governance and the ‘six-pack’ for a long time. Yesterday, this legislative package finally entered into force. It provides us with a bundle of measures to enable us to recognise economic aberrations in the Member States at an early stage.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the area of macro-economic surveillance, the scoreboard has always been at the centre of political discussions here in Parliament. Parliament ultimately decided to lay down the basic elements only in the legislative text and to transfer the task of drawing up the scoreboard to the Commission. The results of the Commission’s work on this are now available. The parameters proposed could be the right way to go about achieving the desired objective.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have already discussed the symmetrical approach of the ‘six-pack’ in our political debates here in Parliament. However, the same sort of symmetrical approach also results from the somewhat erroneous assumption that the European Union is in a closed and bilateral market. If someone exports too much, does that automatically mean that others are exporting too little? I do not think so. Is the problem faced by those Member States that are currently going through difficult economic times really a result of the fact that, in comparison, other Member States are more successful on the internal market or at a global level? That would, conversely, also mean that it would not be a problem if Member States did not fulfil their economic policy tasks at national level if the main thing is that the other Member States are not doing so either. We would not get very far with that sort of approach.</p>
      <p sl="de">The scoreboard will evolve. It requires time, and in the next few years, new indicators will be incorporated and the limit values will probably also change with economic developments. Therefore, Parliament has also determined that it is up to us to observe and evaluate these developments. That is exactly what we are doing by putting this question to you, Commissioner. As a starting point, we in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) consider what the Commission has tabled to be useable and useful. I am certain that it can serve its purpose and can lead to success. Therefore, we will also vote in favour of it.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, Commissioner Rehn, yesterday’s edition of the Financial Times contained a very interesting article on why the fiscal compact agreed on 8 December will fail. With a series of logical and – I would say – self-evident arguments, many of which have been supported for some time by the European Parliament, especially by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the newspaper pointed out that unilateral insistence on fiscal austerity is counterproductive because, in its words, proper fiscal behaviour may, in turn, be linked to massive imbalances and economic inefficiency. Citing the example of Germany which, as you know, had a surplus in its balance of payments on current account in the order of 5.7% of GDP, which was greater than China’s surplus, the journalist pointed out that the fiscal compact will fail because it does not provide any explanation whatsoever as to exactly how that German surplus will be recycled, when more and more European countries, especially but not only in the South, will stand devoutly by strict fiscal austerity and orthodoxy. That is why, Commissioner, we consider action to address macro-economic imbalances not as a fragmentary agreement, but as a basic principle which, over and above the economic governance package, must be inextricably bound up with the new fiscal compact or, in the words of the journalist, fiscal union. May I remind you that the key to achieving agreement on the two regulations was the clear statement – by you, by the European Commission – that the procedure will apply both to Member States in surplus and to Member States with a deficit and to upper and lower limits, so that there is symmetry. This is not a dogmatic principle; it is a precondition which will ensure that the procedure has real economic convergence and balance.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I think the Commissioner explained very well why we need this macro-economic surveillance. The economic crisis proved that macro-economic imbalances can also put the European economy at stake, despite sound – or at least fairly sound – public finances.</p>
      <p sl="de">I also think that we did a fairly thorough job in this House of working on the macro-economic surveillance part. In my view, we achieved a very good overall result, and this is now the practical implementation of that result. Personally, I am convinced by the work done by the Commission (my group is also very supportive) and the initial proposal on the table.</p>
      <p sl="de">I think it is important to note that this is just the starting point of macro-economic surveillance. Some have wanted to give this scoreboard too large a role in the overall process. We should remember that the scoreboard is designed as an alert mechanism. The actual macro-economic surveillance and assessment will be done through in-depth studies, where we will then assess whether there is a problem that has to be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="de">Another issue that should be mentioned is the fact that the ownership of this process should not be in the Commission. I have no doubt that the Commission wants to own it, but the fact of the matter is that the ownership should and will be in the Member States. The Member States will be the ones who have the ownership of working with a possible macro-economic imbalance, together, of course, with the good guidance and good advice of the Commission. But the ownership of the process will, and should be, in the Member States. That is the only way for this process to work, and this is something we should emphasise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I think we should all be happy with the fact that the ‘six-pack’ legislation, which this was a part of, came into force this week. This is an important step in solving the crisis. We should all be happy about this and about the fact that the Commission is taking this work very seriously.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, as far as I can see, in business, in politics and in life, confidence is the key to everything. I believe that you and your Directorate-General have betrayed this confidence.</p>
      <p sl="fr">You have betrayed it in three ways. First, when we had faith in you and said: ‘Parliament renounces its right to joint decision-making power over the indicators’, we had faith in you on the basis of a road map. One of the elements of this road map was that Parliament would be closely consulted. What happened is that the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN), as indeed is its custom, got into bed with the Council, and when they produced their baby together – and I do not wish to know how – they showed this baby to Parliament and asked us: ‘Are you happy?’ That is no way to consult people. I am not one for ménage à trois , but I find that in this case, frankly, you have chosen your partner and I think you have made a bad choice.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The underlying message is: ‘It is not the same thing for a country to be in surplus or in deficit’. That is true. However, to be clearly told: ‘Surplus countries will never be punished’, is tantamount to saying that excessive surpluses are not dangerous. I am very sorry, but by saying that, you ignore the fact that excessive surpluses are as dangerous as excessive deficits. This is the case, and we must deal with it just as vigorously.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, as regards competitiveness, DG ECFIN has shown that, when all is said and done, its obsession has not changed: the only factor standing in the way of the competitiveness of business in Europe is its wages. We must clamp down on wages as if this were the be all and end all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Europe will never be China. We shall never be top of the low wage league. We must win the battle for value.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the new surveillance mechanism for economic imbalances has been in force since yesterday. The detailed regulations are also now available. What developments does the Commission now see as dangerous and what economic problems do you want to see rectified? Increases in unit labour costs in the euro area countries in excess of 3% per year are considered by the Commission to be a problem. A limit value for falling wages is not provided for, however. I would say to the Commission that ‘cheap’ is not the same thing as ‘good’. It is not enough to condition the Member States to achieve prosperity at the expense of their trading partners. Without investment in education, health and energy efficiency, we can exploit our workers to the bone, but that will not enable us to write an economic success story.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to mention one more example from the scoreboard: the loss of export market share should be examined and penalties imposed. That is nonsense. In the face of increasing world trade, Europe’s share will, statistically speaking, inevitably shrink. Consequently, this indicator will penalise those countries that are already closely involved in world trade. We therefore believe that the Commission should withdraw this scoreboard and subject it to a general overhaul.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am personally very unhappy that Brussels makes us act like a guard dog, but if there are to be rules in place, then these should apply to everyone and everyone should be treated in the same way, including the two Member States that want to tell us what is what today.</p>

This instrument must include a complete analysis of these imbalances, including current-account deficits and surpluses. We must not forget that maintaining significant and sustained current-account surpluses creates barriers for the adjustment policies which economies in deficit need to adopt.</p>
      <p sl="ro">At the same time, the issue of the competitiveness gap between Member States cannot be resolved by cutting salaries and reducing social protection. Such measures only weaken society and promote poverty and economic stagnation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, the intention behind the entry into force of the so-called economic governance package is ever deeper capitalist integration, with results that are already well known: increased unemployment, poverty and social inequality. Moreover, what is happening even within this process – and this is being well demonstrated here today – is that the intention is, in fact, to increase the exploitation of workers by reducing real wages and other remuneration for work, to facilitate the accumulation of capital, and to exacerbate social inequalities. Furthermore, the intention is also to jeopardise the interests of countries with weaker economies, by continuously throttling them and even imposing on them fines which will only aggravate the entire existing situation. This is unacceptable interference and contempt for the most fundamental principles of democracy, as this debate in the European Parliament has demonstrated.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to express my strong opposition to subjecting surpluses to the imbalance procedure, let alone imposing sanctions as a result of them. The balance of payments is one of the 10 macro-economic indicators, and it would be perverse to penalise this and to treat it in the same way as deficits. Growth cannot be regulated by a planned economy as in the Soviet Union. Without the economically strong countries, the euro area would probably have collapsed a lot sooner. If the imbalances are too great – and I believe that is the case, too – then we must simply form a hard and a soft currency zone.</p>
      <p sl="de">A currency must reflect the economic strength of the country. It will not work as a planned economy, however, but only with appropriately structured monetary zones. Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and possibly France form one group, and the other national economies also have to be able to devalue their currencies accordingly.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the procedures for countering and correcting macro-economic imbalances should include a mechanism to warn Member States that are reporting a high deficit or current account surplus. A basic precondition for the supervision of macro-economic imbalances should be an assessment table containing the necessary data on the economic management of states. In view of the seriousness of the decisions that will result from the data captured in the assessment reports, it is important for all of the recorded statistical data to be objective and to provide the necessary relevant values. I therefore firmly believe that it is enormously important to choose a method of collecting input data for the assessment table that will rule out the possibility of it being creatively adjusted in the process of collection, so that the Commission can have correct and objective supporting materials for its work. Only on the basis of correct data can correct assessments be made, and that should also be the aim of the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank the Members for a very serious and substantive debate and for their support for this regulation and for the Commission’s actions in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Concerning the question posed by Ms Bowles on the literature behind this scoreboard, the Commission is currently working on background papers that will explain the economic rationale underlying the choice of indicators, including the relevant economic literature and the determination of thresholds. I can commit myself, the Commission, and even DG ECFIN to providing you with these background papers concerning the underlying economic rationale.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Podimata referred to a certain British financial media source. I do not think its words are sacrosanct. I recall, for instance, that in that source, the euro area was not described as a small open economy, but I have a feeling that some commentators consider that the euro area is a large, closed economy. It is not a large closed economy. Instead, it is a large open economy that trades a very large share of its GDP with the rest of the world. This has obvious implications for the construction of our analytical mechanism of macro-economic imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="en">The legislation enshrines the approach of intelligent symmetry, whereby surveillance covers both deficits and surpluses, but clearly underlines that there is greater urgency in tackling large deficits. Moreover, policy responses need to be differentiated. I refer to the alert mechanism report which, in Article 3.2, states ‘The assessment of Member States showing large current account deficits may differ from that of Member States that accumulate large current account surpluses’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think the background noise suggests that it is time to close this debate. It is not very conducive to analytical debate on macro-economic imbalances, so I suggest we continue our dialogue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs shortly.</p>

I am honoured to award the European Parliament Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2011 to five courageous women and men who represent the Arab Spring. The prize goes to:</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ms Asmaa Mahfouz, from Egypt,</p>

      <p sl="unknown">and the late Mr Mohamed Bouazizi, from Tunisia.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">Dear friends, human rights are universal. We all value human dignity, freedom of thought and expression, as well as responsible and accountable government, and we are all entitled to it. By awarding the Sakharov Prize to the five Arab Spring activists, the European Parliament recognises the efforts of all those who struggle for dignity, basic freedoms and political change in the Arab world.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Looking back at this year’s events following the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia, we witnessed the removal of a dictator, and recently free elections. To honour the courage of the Tunisian people, we award the Sakharov Prize to the late Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street salesman. He set himself on fire after his authorities repeatedly denied him the most basic elements of a life of dignity. Since then, history has swept across North Africa and the Arab World, and many lost their lives for basic freedoms and human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">In many places, the struggle is ongoing as we speak. In Syria, protestors’ demands are met by bullets, tear gas, tanks, arbitrary detention and torture. The latest number of deaths reported exceed 5 000, including 300 children. In order to honour and remember Mr Bouazizi and all those who lost their lives in the struggle for freedom and dignity in the Arab World, I would like to ask all of us to observe a minute’s silence.</p>
      <a text="(The House rose and observed a minute’s silence)"/>
      <p sl="unknown">This historical events also remind us of our responsibilities, including the need to support an emerging young and vibrant civil society. Among our prize winners, we have two young ladies, representatives of a new generation, Asmaa Mahfouz, from Egypt and Razan Zaitouneh, from Syria. They deserve not only our admiration and respect, but better prospects for their future. Their nomination represents a tribute to the decisive role played by women during the Arab Spring.</p>
      <a text="(Applause)"/>

She is a shining example and a symbol of how an individual can make a difference, leading by inspiration and by the strongest possible conviction of human rights, despite the risks of intimidation by the authorities. Ms Mahfouz, I would like to invite you to deliver a speech to us from the podium below.</p>

We need this new dimension, this new approach.</p>
      <p sl="en">After the Arab Spring, and based on the interest that is now focused on the Arab world, I think that we can be proud of the Arab people because they are very much in favour of universal values of respect for human dignity. This reward pays homage to the heroes of the revolution. This is a prize that goes out to all young Egyptians, people that have sacrificed their lives. They have been more courageous than I have. They have sacrificed their lives in the name of liberty for everybody.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Egyptian revolution led to the overthrow of the regime. Many European countries and the USA supported the Mubarak regime before that overthrow but still this was achieved and the regime has now changed. The regime now is based on several people, not just a single person, and we want to ensure that we build on this success and build on a pacifist approach with no violence. And we want to ensure that no members of the former regime enjoy any support whatsoever. There are young people who are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the objectives of the revolution and for the birth of a civilised country based on human rights for all.</p>
      <p sl="en">Each time there is an infringement or an attack on a human life, we need speedy intervention and we should not be waiting any longer. People were killed. Why did we wait so long before we took action? One occasion is enough to see that there has been a violation of human rights. This finally led to the Arab world taking a place of priority in the world.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to tell you about how proud I am of all the martyrs of the Arab revolution. We will not betray them; we will continue along the road that they have entered into and we want to make sure that this dream is fulfilled.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President of the European Parliament, honourable Members of the Parliament, guests, let me begin by giving you my warmest greetings and expressing my thanks and gratitude to you for having chosen me as a recipient of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. This prize has huge symbolic and moral value. It is something that the people of Libya appreciate. They have congratulated me on having been awarded the prize.</p>
      <p sl="en">It also provides further stimulus for the consolidation of the values we have always been in favour of, that is to say, the creation of a democratic, constitutional state based upon the equality of all, a state where women enjoy the freedom to vote and stand in elections, to make their voices heard.</p>
      <p sl="en">Women have made huge sacrifices in Libya. Women have laid down their lives. They have seen their nearest and dearest, their children die, to try to get rid of this totalitarian regime which we suffered from for more than 42 years – in prisons, with constant humiliation, constant violations of our human dignity. It was these years and years of dictatorship that eventually led young people to lay down their lives, to shed their blood, even though they had no weapons. The only weapon that they had was their commitment, their conviction. That is what won out in the end, thanks to the support from the international community and this European Parliament. I would just like to express my gratitude to you for that.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now we need to rebuild our country, to do so in a tolerant fashion, showing tolerance even to those who committed crimes, who targeted our sons, our brothers, those who destroyed houses, who violated human dignity. I am sure that you saw these things on television, all the crimes that were committed in Libya. Again, we are grateful for the unambiguous economic, diplomatic and military support that Europe provided.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I said, we had no weapons and the dictator tried to keep us down by force thanks to the links he had forged with certain countries, countries that supported him for various reasons – economic reasons sometimes, and other reasons. But all of these countries realised that ultimately the people would win. The people always remain. That is why we would like to thank Europe for the position that it adopted and thank of course the whole of the international community.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we have to say that our European neighbours – our closest neighbours – were the first to support the Libyan people, despite their lack of weapons. Thanks to that support, we managed to get rid of this totalitarian regime that had been in place for 42 years. I myself of course was a prisoner of conscience under Gaddafi. I was in prison for 31 years, including nine years in solitary confinement. I was tortured, I was denied health care, but I did not lose hope. During all of those years, I did not abandon my human dignity.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Libya now, we want to be treated on the same footing as everybody else; we do not want to be described as a nation of terrorists or people who have no right to life. We love life: our own lives and the lives of others as well. And we hope that the Sakharov Prize will allow us to make progress and allow other states still suffering from dictatorships to make progress too. Please support us, and support us in trying to achieve those goals.

      <p sl="unknown">Dear colleagues, the Sakharov Prize is awarded for freedom of thought and this can take many forms. Sometimes, a painting speaks more than a thousand words. This is demonstrated by the drawings and cartoons of Mr Ali Farzat. His weapon is the pen. Through his creativity and courage, his cartoons have pushed the boundaries of freedom of expression in Syria and the entire Arab world. His political cartoons reflect his ideals.</p>
      <p sl="unknown">Ali Farzat was beaten up by security forces in August. Both his hands were broken, but he sent us a video message, being unable to come to the European Parliament. I would like to invite you to watch his video message.</p>

I should so much have liked to have been with you today to receive this prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought and to thank you for this immense honour that you have bestowed upon me. Personal circumstances have meant that I am unable to be with you. However, my sincere wishes and my heart are with you all.</p>
      <p sl="fr">While I am happy to receive this prestigious prize and to be with you, albeit symbolically, I am sad about what is happening at the moment in Syria. Every hour, every minute, every second, someone is killed and this saddens and embitters me.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I believe that the souls of the dead, the wounded, the people in the streets, are all here with us today. They speak to us of the importance and the great value of freedom and they tell us that it is a gift from God.</p>
      <p sl="fr">A short time ago, I asked one of my friends: ‘As you go out and demonstrate in the streets every day, are you not scared of being killed?’ He replied: ‘Of course, I am constantly weighing up the risks and I know that death is round the corner. But you understand, Ali, how precious freedom is. This is the first time in my life that I have managed to make my voice heard. I had not heard my own voice for 50 years, until today. Whatever happens and may happen to me, I will at least have asserted my right to life and to freedom’.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I should like to extend my deepest gratitude to everybody here today and to all those who have contributed to honouring me within the European Parliament – I would like to send best wishes to Mr Geoffrey Harris, Head of the Human Rights Unit, and to Mr Buzek, President of the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="it">I therefore applaud any initiative which offers even greater clarity to European consumers through labelling, particularly of the origin of fruit content, compared with what was previously approved.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, European fruit juice consumers will be aware of the origin of the fruit content and this will be advantageous to European farmers, above all, those working in southern Europe, who have not previously been able to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, welcome the vote today approving a compromise on the Fruit Juices Directive which aims to improve production standards and set rules for the quality and labelling of fruit juices. This will not only help consumers to make healthier choices, but also improve the added value of European products on the international markets. It is a very good deal for both the UK fruit industry and UK consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">From now on, there will be clear rules on what aromas and ingredients can be used. As a result, for example, the practice of labelling as ‘strawberry juice’ a product which contains more than 50% apple juice, and of which strawberries are only a minor ingredient, will now be banned. This will bring an end to marketing strategies that mislead consumers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The practice of adding sugar to fruit juices will also be prohibited. This will ensure that only genuine fruit juices are marketed as such in the EU. Consumers will now be able to buy these products secure in the knowledge that the labelling accurately reflects what is in the can.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when I first worked on this directive, I stopped drinking fruit juice. I stopped trusting what was on the label. One wonders if the labelling of fruit juice has any resemblance to what is in the product.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is why I am glad the amendments to the Fruit Juice Directive mean that clearer labelling will give consumers more accurate information, not only on the sugar content, but on the actual quantity of fruit in these drinks. Without this directive, manufacturers will be able to label a drink as strawberry juice, for example, when in reality, there is only a touch of strawberry, a lot of flavouring and an apple base.</p>
      <p sl="en">The public has a right to know what is in the juice: if it is pure, is nectar or is made from concentrate; if it contains added sugar, no sugar, honey or sweeteners. We need to make it easy for customers to make a healthy choice. We need to ensure that there is transparency in the market. I hope the Fruit Juice Directive will result in a high quality of fruit juice as opposed to sugary drinks.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the situation on the market for fruit juices in the EU, where more than 80% of orange juice – the most prevalent raw material – comes from non-European countries and less than 20% from EU countries, requires the laying down of clear rules governing the composition, use of reserved descriptions, manufacturing specifications and labelling of the products concerned. At the general level, I support the idea of bringing the fruit juice sector into line with international law and the Codex Alimentarius. I also agree with retaining the distinction between fruit juices obtained by simply pressing fruit and fruit juices from concentrates, as well as the removal of sugar from the list of authorised ingredients. Unambiguous denomination will particularly help groups of consumers such as, for example, diabetics, children and people with weight problems or obesity to make informed choices when purchasing a product that can influence their health.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, the proposal for a directive that we voted on this morning aims to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, since it has already been voted on in Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="it">I very much welcome drawing a clear distinction between fruit juices and juices from concentrates, which is one of the aims put forward by the directive: the idea is not to mislead the consumer at the moment of purchase; it instead favours informed purchasing, which will also encourage healthier consumption.</p>
      <p sl="it">On the subject of benefiting citizens, the text sets out the distinction between juice and nectar as depending on the presence or absence of sugars in such products. The term ‘no added sugar’ should be allowed for category 1 fruit juices. With regard to nectar, it was not considered necessary to specify the mandatory presence of sugar. All in all, this is a directive which will be of benefit to citizens and consumers, enabling them to make informed purchases more easily.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, I was unable to support the amendment to the Fruit Juice Directive for reasons relating to its content as well as on formal grounds. Thus, I cannot share the optimism of my fellow Members on this issue. In terms of content, this directive represents a relaxation of the quality requirements for fruit juice products and thus opens the door wide to the possibility of deceiving consumers. On formal grounds, the main reason for my objection is the fact that the current text in no way corresponds to the intentions of the committee responsible. A large part of the report that was agreed on there has not been taken into account in the compromise text that has been tabled. As the amendment to the Fruit Juice Directive therefore entails a reduction in the quality of fruit juices and, moreover, does not adequately reflect the opinion of Parliament, I was forced to reject it.</p>

The report recommends sensible measures relating to consumer transparency and will allow EU citizens to more easily make informed and healthy choices as regards what they consume. I have to confess an interest here: I am a prolific juice-drinker myself.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fruit-based beverages which originate from concentrate or have added sugar should be transparently labelled as such so as to prevent them from being mistaken for fresh or pure fruit juices, especially given the sometimes misleading packaging used by some manufacturers. A transitional period of 18 months would allow distributors and retailers to use up current stocks and adjust to the new, tougher guidelines. The report also reiterates the EU’s commitment to maintaining globally recognised labelling standards for fruit juices, which will ensure that EU products remain competitive on the global market.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report’s proposed amendments to the existing directive make the necessary clear distinction between fruit juices and drinks that have been produced from concentrate. There is more clarity in the labelling, which is critical for those of us who want to make a choice based on healthy options and want to know when there has been sugar added to the drink. This is going to lead to greater consumer choice and hopefully, over the longer term, lead to a healthier population, including in my Welsh constituency.</p>

It is very important for consumers to know if there is added sugar or not and how much real fruit exists in the juices they buy. How many times has it happened to you that you buy fruit juice and then discover that the picture on the package or the name on the package does not really correspond to the quantity of orange, berry or apple juice that you thought was there; you feel cheated.</p>
      <p sl="en">This directive, therefore, is a very important step forward in our fight against misleading information. It will benefit consumers by giving correct, clear and reliable information.

So there we have it: let us favour local products at the expense of open trade and instead of helping producers in other countries to create wealth locally. This protectionist strand runs throughout the whole report and what we are going to see is a situation where we continue to support companies that cannot compete globally. When they get into trouble, what will they then do? They will seek a bailout from the European Globalisation Fund because they did not bother to take advantage of global supply chains and compete globally; they sought protectionism.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, we all need to give more information to consumers and I think there is consensus about this across the House. Let us say ‘yes’ to consumer information, let us say ‘yes’ to open trade and consumer choice, but let us say ‘no’ to European protectionism.</p>

I am in favour of high-quality fruit juices and consistent information for consumers. Where there are two producers of equal quality, I always prefer the European one ahead of the foreign one. I am also in favour of us being informed about whether juice comes from concentrate. At the same time, however, I supported the proposal to continue to allow juice from concentrate to be diluted with drinking water. Fruit juices from concentrate will thus continue to be affordable for children from low income families.</p>

The chemicals used in dishwasher detergents are very different to the laundry detergents. However, small traces of phosphates will still be permitted in dishwasher detergents, with a honeymoon period until 2017.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst we all agree that phosphates would ideally not be included, let me sound a warning.

I think that the report, the proposal and the regulation is attempting to find a good compromise here, namely, on the one hand, to eliminate these phosphates permanently and definitively, so to speak, from the environment. We all know that this is a very hazardous environmental toxin. That is, of course, why phosphates will no longer be used in household laundry detergents.</p>
      <p sl="de">On the other hand, we obviously also have to face up to reality. Firstly, we need effective alternatives, and, secondly, we obviously also need to examine the environmental impact of these effective alternatives, because there is no point in essentially replacing one pollutant with another one.</p>

It is also very important news for the Baltic Sea, the water of which is seriously affected by pollution from phosphorus compounds causing algae growth, and this growth is becoming more and more intensive and active every year. According to the Helsinki Commission, if we were to abandon phosphates, algae blooms in the Baltic Sea would be reduced by 24%. Today, we took the first step by setting a limit of 0.5 grams in detergents. The fact that a legal act has been adopted that immediately enters into force will mean that in countries where the use of phosphates is not regulated, people will no longer have to simply rely on the goodwill of manufacturers of maintenance products and consumer awareness, as has been the case until now. The maximum levels of phosphates used in European Union Member States varies considerably and, as a result, approximately 16 000 tonnes of phosphates end up in the Baltic Sea every year. I hope that the Member States will welcome our position and that, following the entry into force of this regulation and the acceleration of waste water treatment, the condition of the Baltic and other seas will improve considerably.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I, too, voted in favour of the Newton Dunn report which deals with the use of phosphates and other phosphorous-based compounds in household laundry detergents. The central purpose of this report was to reduce the often devastating impact of eutrophication on the EU’s rivers, lakes and seas. Eutrophication effectively chokes water of oxygen by encouraging weeds to grow. Phosphates are a kind of fertiliser, thus disrupting the natural biodiversity of bodies of water, and have a huge detrimental effect on aquatic life.</p>
      <p sl="en">The rapporteur sought to allow legislation effectively to catch up with industrial best practice, as a majority of marketed laundry detergents are now effectively phosphate-free. Despite my initial concerns over the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on this matter, such as the short compliance timeline envisaged for its implementation, following the recent negotiations with the Council, I can now agree that this ban on phosphates usage could also be extended to dishwater detergents, with suitable derogations. Realistic and reasonable limits have now been set at 0.5 grams per dose, paving the way for manufacturers to develop more compact and concentrated products to the benefit of our environment.</p>

      <p sl="it">Phosphorus helps life to flourish and, as a result, algae and other fast-developing plant life proliferate uncontrollably when there is an increased source of phosphorus in water. This excessive growth of algae starves other living organisms of oxygen and can also produce toxins – killing fish, plants, and other species, thereby reducing the quality of the water itself.</p>

The harder the water, the greater the need for phosphates when washing up or cleaning clothes. We know that the release of phosphates into drains causes excessive growth of algae, thereby also causing the loss of other life forms in our rivers. In other words, phosphate use harms the environment. I would like to ask two questions. Is it possible to wash things clean without phosphates? In principle, yes. Is it possible to stop using phosphates in dishwashers? Not yet. It is therefore right for us to try to limit their use, while at the same time accepting the fact that we need them.

      <p sl="en">I voted against the report, as it is probably the least successful of all the fisheries agreements currently in force. For a number of reasons, I believe that we should have rejected the report and I am glad the Parliament did. For a start, it is a poor deal for European taxpayers, with a return of only 65 cents for every euro the European Union is investing. From a sustainability point of view, the stocks we are accessing are already overfished, so not only are we heavily subsidising jobs, but we are doing so while exporting ecologically unsustainable fishing practices. On top of that, only 15% of the funds allocated for sectoral support in the agreement have been used to date.

I will only be able to support a new agreement if a solution is found that complies with international law and respects human rights.

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the common fisheries policy is being transformed from a European into a global tragedy; having emptied, exhausted and sterilised our seas, we now export the same practices to more vulnerable and poorer countries and we have the same basic flaw, which is lack of ownership rights which would have incentivised conservation.</p>
      <p sl="en">There are successful fisheries’ conservation schemes around the world in New Zealand, in Norway, in Iceland, in the Falkland Islands, but all of them are based on giving skippers a sense of property so that they treat fisheries as a renewable resource. We tragically suffer from common ownership which makes it impossible to persuade fishermen to tie up their boats knowing that other nations’ vessels are at large in the same seas. Surely having created this ecological catastrophe in our own waters, we should now draw back before we inflict it on others.</p>

However, if we have technical problems with Morocco, we should actually discuss them at a technical level and not misuse the subject of human rights. If there is a country in North Africa where the balance between freedom and stability, between human rights and constitutional development, has, to a certain extent, been achieved, then it is Morocco. We ought to acknowledge this and not bow to the erroneous arguments of a Polisario lobby. We need to be clear on this: Morocco is an ancient, complex country that is showing positive development. As a result of the new elections, this development has gone a step further in the right direction. I would warn against misusing this matter for other purposes.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, given the failure of the common fisheries policy in Europe and the way that our seas do not have sufficient fish, what is interesting about this is the way that, as my colleague said earlier, we now seek to make agreements that are unsustainable with other countries. Because of this lack of ownership rights, which led to the failure of the CFP, we are now seeing the lack of ownership rights in other countries and we worry about the future of fish in those areas.</p>
      <p sl="en">The real problem here is that where there are no ownership rights, a government seeks that ownership on behalf of its citizens, but in the case of Morocco, not only on behalf of its own citizens, but on behalf of the Western Saharan people, too. In this case, what will happen is that they will plunder those seas and local fishermen will lose out. When local fishermen lose out from such deals, what do they seek to do in many cases? They seek a better life in the West, in Europe. What do we then do in this House? We complain about immigration – when we have destroyed their jobs. Let us make sure we look at the full impact of these agreements and let us not destroy the seas of other countries.</p>

Working-class people are being asked to take cuts in their jobs, cuts to their pay, cuts to their public services, and here we have the Parliament agreeing to a report insisting that the so-called defence sector is protected from any cuts.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let us be absolutely clear. This is a significant amount of European taxpayers’ money that is being funnelled into the coffers of these makers of weapons of mass destruction or weapons of individual destruction. It is fostering the development of the military-industrial complex within Europe. The biggest weapons corporation in Europe, BAE, made almost EUR 3 billion in profit last year selling weapons to the likes of Saudi Arabia and the Israeli army and selling weapons that are used in Iraq, in Afghanistan and elsewhere to kill ordinary people. Instead of pouring money into their coffers, we should be investing, creating jobs, defending public services. We should take these major corporations into democratic public ownership and we should redeploy the capital and the workers to socially useful industries.</p>

I wish, however, to draw attention to the fact that this situation will grow worse, and defence will receive less and less funding in the EU Member States as a result of the crisis. We must therefore concentrate this funding.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I think that it should be focused on two areas. Firstly, the Union’s common defence capabilities should be stepped up. Here, I would stress most emphatically that it is not just about the defence capabilities of individual states, but about the fact that the Union has greater capabilities. Secondly, there must be clear progress in one area, in other words, funding for research and modern technologies. In Europe, we spend a mere EUR 2 billion annually on this, while the United States spends 10 times more. Resources must be increased significantly in this area.</p>

In the UK, this was made worse by the fact that the last Labour government left the present coalition with GBP 38 billion of unfunded commitments. However, in the field of defence, as everywhere else, I do not believe the answer is ‘more Europe’. ‘More Europe’ means more costs as EU bureaucrats create super-structures, with super-budgets to match.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must avoid expensive duplication of NATO structures and ensure that the EU has nothing to do with defence.

      <p sl="it">Mr President, despite the serious financial crisis we are bound up in, there are certain economic sectors which are never affected, or rather only minimally affected, by the cuts imposed by the austerity measures adopted by Member States.</p>
      <p sl="it">For example, the so-called ‘tears and blood’ financial austerity plan put together by the Italian Government is turning out to only be tears and blood for the usual suspects, in other words, workers and pensioners. Military expenditure, on the other hand, seems to be unaffected, ever since the announcement of the purchase of 131 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) bombers, which the Italian Government will still be paying for in 2026 at a total cost of around EUR 15 billion, that is, almost half of the ‘tears and blood’ plan to which we are currently being subjected.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is just one of the reasons why I voted against the Lisek report. Despite some good ideas aimed at reducing expenditure, it describes cuts to the defence sector as concerning. Ladies and gentlemen, there are many other cuts which should be of greater concern to us at times like this.</p>

      <p sl="en">However, I believe that the report itself makes the wrong proposals to address this issue, which is why I have voted against the report. It suggests that the strategic autonomy of the EU should be enhanced by acquiring more synergy in defence planning measures, such as through better coordination of defence planning – a laudable objective but one which would require harmonisation of military requirements and significant measures to increase interoperability.</p>

I believe that we urgently need a common European foreign and security policy and, of course, also the goal of a common European army and common European defence system. On our way to achieving this, we will be able to save enormous amounts of money. It is particularly important to highlight this during the financial crisis, because if, like the Americans, we Europeans were to acquire and purchase what we need jointly rather than separately, we would be able to save a fifth of our costs in the defence sector. We could increase our efficiency and, at the same time, free up large sums of money for other areas, for social policy for example.

The regime did its very best to scare people into not attending the protests. There were massive threats of repression, with rumours of extra troops being brought into Moscow. The schools even opened on Saturday to try to prevent people from coming, but nonetheless people courageously came out and protested, in their tens and hundreds of thousands, because of the depth of anger and opposition at the blatant election rigging. One hundred thousand turned up in Moscow and ten thousand in St Petersburg, and there were up to a hundred other significant protests in other cities.</p>

We are already bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in this. A respect for human rights is already, in itself, an effective counter-terrorism policy. We cannot surrender our values in the face of terrorism.</p>
      <p sl="fi">We need to give more attention to the matter of the preventive fight against terrorism, since radicalisation is one of today’s greatest threats to our society. Racism and exclusion are linked to the emergence of extremism. Resources need to be concentrated on greater tolerance in societies and the prevention of exclusion. I would also call for an open, broad-based debate, involving society as a whole, on our common European values.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, I supported the report on EU counter-terrorism policy. I am deeply convinced of the need to support it since, unfortunately, terrorism and organised crime are today the primary threat to security in Europe. Combating this threat requires cooperation between the Union’s Member States and coordination between the different services – here I am thinking of the intelligence services and the police, but also the judiciary. If it is to be effective, this fight must be conducted not just by one country but by all countries. I therefore also believe that the powers of the EU’s Counter-Terrorism Coordinator should be increased. This seems to me to be very important.</p>

      <p sl="en">Effective anti-terrorism measures are a must. Anti-terrorism measures must be coordinated across national borders and in line with a threat-based approach.

I can therefore see the benefits of Member States working together on counter-terrorism measures and the EU has already made significant progress in counter-terrorism work, such as in the sharing of international banking data and air passenger security.</p>
      <p sl="en">Whilst the report on the EU’s counter-terrorism policy puts forward some sensible measures to the policy, such as a risk-based approach that is tailored to each Member State and the need to examine the costs and the current allocation of European spending, there are still a number of areas that require clarification.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am not comfortable with permitting the EU institutions to act as the facilitator of intelligence sharing between Member States, as this should not be an EU competence. Issues concerning national security are a Member State competence and should remain so. Terrorists do not respect borders; they act globally. Counter-terrorism measures need equally to reflect a global, not solely EU, focus.</p>

This assistance is provided as part of European partnerships with potential candidates and actual candidates for accession, including the Western Balkan States and Iceland. Iceland and Montenegro have been candidate countries for EU entry since 2010. Since the IPA is quite a flexible tool, it is possible to alter support for beneficiary countries based on the requirements which emerge from the Commission’s evaluations and documents. Here we see two different situations: Iceland, for example, has a per capita GDP which is higher than the European average, whilst the administrative and financial management of Montenegro, due to its different national history, has quite different demands and issues in terms of financial transparency. We therefore need to adapt the allocation rules for IPA financing – Cross-border Cooperation (CBC) and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) – to reflect the new information available on the two candidate countries.</p>

The first amendment involves Iceland and Montenegro being moved from the list of potential candidate countries to that of candidate countries. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has always supported the enlargement process in countries of the Western Balkans, while Iceland has already begun accession negotiations as it meets the Copenhagen criteria by far. I agree with the Commission’s second proposal for amendment which would limit participation in the CBC programmes, that is, the cross-border cooperation programmes of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), exclusively to local actors. Being a border country of the European Union, it is particularly important to Hungary that participation in tenders is limited to applicants from countries that are involved in the relevant CBC programmes of the IPA. One potential candidate country remains in the neighbourhood of my country, and that is Serbia.

Iceland and Montenegro requested accession to the European Union on 17 June and 17 December 2010, respectively, and the Council decided, on the basis of the Commission’s opinion, that accession negotiations should begin as soon as the conditions set out at the 1993 European Council in Copenhagen were met, when they would merit the status of ‘candidate countries’.

In the past, there have been frequent occurrences of irregularities. Billions of euro are still going missing because Brussels is not able or willing finally to make lasting changes aimed at putting this instrument in order. With a laissez-faire attitude, Brussels is not even making an effort to demand back the funds that have been wrongly paid out. Again, the will to make changes seems to be lacking.

In other words, less than 20% of the orange juice consumed in the EU is produced here.

The aim, as stated in the recitals of the directive, is to contribute towards the free movement of these products. The European Union produces high-quality fruit juices, which contribute to a healthy and balanced diet. They are manufactured according to the sustainability standards supported by our laws. Therefore, from the point of view of businesses operating in the EU, the requirement that all products being marketed in the EU should be subject to the same standards of quality is fair. We also have to consider environmental aspects: local products do not have to be transported over vast distances, generating CO2 emissions.

These new rules reflect new international regulations on permitted ingredients and the addition of sugar, which will no longer be allowed in fruit juices. The new rules, which will apply to all such products sold within the EU, even those imported from third countries, also specify that only juice not containing other fruit juices may be sold as ‘orange juice’. In the case of juices sold as a mixture of two or more juices, the name should also include the proportion of each fruit juice included, in descending order of volume. These measures need to be reinforced by specific information campaigns enabling customers to know exactly what product they are buying. I am therefore voting for this report.</p>

      <p sl="fr">New labelling rules for fruit juices and nectars have been adopted by the European Parliament and they offer consumers greater transparency. The goal is indeed to inform consumers, so that they have clear information about what is a genuine fruit juice and what is not. These rules aim to prevent potentially misleading names being given to mixtures of fruit juices and to define clearly the ‘no added sugar’ claims so that consumers are able to quickly and clearly identify the presence of sugars or sweeteners. Henceforth, a mixture of two juices will also have to be named in such a way that fully reflects its contents. Consumers must be provided with accurate information so that they can make informed choices when purchasing food products such as fruit juices.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this report because I agree that we have to create the conditions to continue to develop the European Union’s fruit juice (and similar products) sector. The EU directive adopted back in 2001 brought major and important changes to the way the industry is regulated and, most importantly, to consumer protection. That is because, under this directive, producers were obliged to indicate on labels whether the juice was produced from concentrate or whether it is genuine pressed fruit juice. It is proposed that this distinction be maintained in the review phase of the abovementioned directive. Another key feature of the revision is that it brings the directive more closely into line with the Codex Alimentarius and determines whether certain processes applied for juices produced in other regions of the globe can be applied for juices produced in the European Union. Take, for instance, the addition of mandarin juice to orange juice, which the European Parliament does not oppose because this not only intensifies the colour and flavour but, in some cases, responds to the demands of certain categories of consumer. Although Parliament is looking more closely at so-called flavour reconstitution, it agrees with the Commission’s position that flavour, pulp and cells obtained by suitable physical means from the same species of fruit may be restored to the juice, but consumers must be informed of this on the packaging.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted for Mr Perello Rodriguez’s report. In Europe, fruit juices and certain similar products constitute an industrial sector of considerable size. Nevertheless, taking orange juice as a point of reference, 82% of the juice consumed in the EU comes directly from Brazil and the United States, while less than 20% is produced in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="it">The European processing industry, unlike that in other countries, is complementary to the fresh produce market and consequently, this results in large-scale importation of fresh produce, leading to high environmental costs in terms of CO2 . We must therefore firmly support the European sector, which offers significant added value, not least in terms of employment and improving the quality of produce, including through more sustainable production processes which can also influence producers in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, I also agree with the importance of using wording such as ‘no added sugar’ on packages, since there is considerable confusion surrounding these kinds of products. At the same time, I believe it is right to launch targeted information campaigns to enable consumers to know exactly what they are buying.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Fruit juices produced in the European Union are high-quality products which contribute to a healthy and balanced diet and are manufactured according to the sustainability standards supported by our law. It is therefore important that we should ensure the high quality of all products sold on the European market. Without seeking to undermine any import policy, this report, in my opinion, rightly favours the consumption of local products, which do not have to be transported over vast distances, which are produced under social and labour conditions that are acceptable under Community law, and which are manufactured according to the food safety principles of the EU. This is not a matter of European protectionism, but of reflecting the continued pursuit of sustainability in all sectors of our economy. The overall quality of a product can also be measured by its ethical quality, its ecological quality and its social quality. Although I agree with most of the requirements in the draft revision submitted by the Commission, I have some doubts regarding the role of this body in the future, specifically in relation to the delegated acts. For this reason, I agree with the correction to Article 7a paragraph 1a such that the period for the Commission’s delegated powers is amended from ‘an unfixed period’ to five years. I would also like to add that the tacit renewal mechanism should be used if there are no substantial changes after five years justifying a revision of the rules.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The report is devoted mainly to clarifying the legal environment for the labelling of fruit juices. This primarily involves the definition of terms such as ‘fruit juice’, ‘fruit nectar’, ‘fruit drink’ and ‘lemonade’. The terms in question mainly indicate differences in the content of fruit juice, with the term ‘fruit juice’ itself denoting 100% fruit content, while the fruit content in nectar can be as low as 25%, and in a fruit drink less than 25%. The amendment to the directive also introduces a new obligation to indicate on the packaging, in lettering at least half the size of the product name, whether it is a fruit juice, nectar, drink or lemonade. This measure will help to make consumers more aware of the content of these products, and consumers will more easily understand the quality of a given product. The consumer will also not be confused in future as to whether a product is 100% fruit or whether it contains any substitutes. I consider all of the proposed measures to be beneficial to consumers. Older people in particular will be better able to understand what the actual content of a given product is, and I consider this important in relation to the forthcoming Year for Active Ageing.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The new rules on fruit juices and certain similar products introduce for the first time a clear distinction between natural fruit juices and drinks which contain added sugar. Our aim in adopting this report is not to make a choice for consumers, but only to ensure that they are fully informed at the time of choosing the product. Given that the sector for fruit juices and other similar products is an industry with a considerable market share in the European Union, the revised rules on the composition and labelling of these products and a clear indication of added sugar will ensure the high quality of all products sold throughout the EU and will help improve the internal market.</p>

The name given to these mixed juices will also have to better reflect the ingredients actually used to produce the drink, by indicating the different fruits used. Furthermore, clearer information on sugar and sweetener content in these products will also be included on the labels. Specifically, fruit juices will not include by definition any sweetener or added sugar, unlike nectars.

      <p sl="sk">The fruit juice market in the EU accounts for 10% of total consumption of non-alcoholic drinks. As far as market breakdown is concerned, output of fruit juices from concentrate is greater than that of juices produced directly. In terms of the global market in fruit juices, a large number of EU countries are primarily supplied by Spain and Brazil. In Council Directive 2001/112/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption, specific provisions are laid down regarding the production, composition and labelling of fruit juices and similar products, in order to enhance their free movement within the EU. In my opinion, those rules should be adapted to technical progress and should take account of developments in the relevant international standards. The ordinary legislative procedure set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will apply to this proposed directive. The redefinition of the powers of the Commission (Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty) will also be taken into account. As a result of this, the submitted draft directive amends Articles 7 and 8 of the current directive by incorporating all of the implementing measures into the category of delegated acts.</p>

      <p sl="it">Over the last two decades, consumption of fruit juices in Europe has almost doubled, owing in part to European awareness campaigns on what constitutes a proper diet. Thanks to the directive adopted today, fruit juice can at last be defined as such only if it contains 100% fruit without any kind of additive, with an indication of the origin of the raw material used. Moreover, Europe must ensure greater transparency for consumers, not least through the indication of the origin of the raw materials used. This is a fundamental fact considering that 82% of the orange juice consumed in Europe comes from Brazil and the United States. Therefore, from now on, we shall no longer be in danger of finding on our tables juices created from mixtures of unknown fruits which are not indicated on the product.

Adding mandarin juice to orange juice, without declaring you have done so, was, to my mind, a fraudulent practice and a genuine deception.

It is particularly important to clarify this difference concerning the presence or absence of sugar in these products because this is an issue of particular concern for consumer groups with specific needs (diabetics, children, people with weight problems, etc.). A single set of standards should be applied to all fruit juices and related products marketed in the EU, and particular attention should be drawn to harmless practices.

      <p sl="de">The fruit juice sector is a branch of industry which, globally speaking, should not be underestimated. Within the European Union, too, this sector of industry can be considered to be significant in size. However, it is also the case that, with regard to the production of fruit juices, particularly the popular orange juice, 80% of what is consumed in the EU is imported from North America and Brazil. The production process also differs, since in these countries, all fruits are used in juice processing, whereas throughout the EU, only substandard goods that are no longer of use to the trade are used. For consumers, this means that the origin of the juice needs to be indicated particularly clearly in order to be able to inform them, in an unambiguous manner, of where the product has come from.</p>

However, from now on, we should rest assured that the labels are ‘real’, that is, that they accurately state the content of fruit juices or nectars.

      <p sl="de">In the fruit juice sector, we import more than 80% of some varieties, from Brazil or the United States, for example. Where citrus fruits are concerned, rather than being made up of large international producers, the European industry is an auxiliary industry supplementing the processing of fresh fruit. Processing frequently involves selling those fruits which, due to their appearance (size, marks), are not marketed as fresh fruits, although they are perfectly suitable for providing high-quality fruit juices. On account of the environmental costs associated with imports (CO2 emissions), it is essential that we increase our support for the European fruit juice industry. This would also avoid fruits that are less suitable for being sold as fresh fruit from being destroyed and prevent unharvested fruit rotting in the field, which can lead to the spread of disease. This would bring socio-economic added value with the creation of jobs and growth. In addition, labelling, classification, approved additives and practices are to be clarified. In this regard, stringent requirements must also apply to imports that are currently already sold in the EU. This will provide an incentive for third countries to improve the quality of their products using sustainable production processes. Another positive element is the retention of the double designation, which distinguishes between pressed juices made from fresh fruit and fruit juices made from concentrate. Since the report takes these aspects into account, I voted in favour of it.</p>

The implementation of the provisions of this directive will enable consumers to choose a product that has undergone as little processing and is as natural as possible. The dual classification will ensure that consumers are given accurate information and that pictorial representations on packaging do not mislead the consumer as to the actual composition of the juice. It should be noted that the application of the same rules throughout the territory of the Community will facilitate the free movement of these products and will help prevent fraud and unfair competition.

The main reason for this is that, in the European Union, fruit juices are made from surplus fruit crops and not from fruit grown expressly for juice production. In this way, the European productive cycle manages to optimise the available resources, as well as avoid long journeys in distributing the product throughout the common market.

This is a very attractive market, as Europeans drink 300 million litres of orange juice a year, or half of global consumption. In other words, the agreement reached on the Fruit Juice Directive by the European Parliament delegation, of which I was a member, and the Polish Presidency, was hardly a straightforward matter. Henceforth, it will not be permitted to name a juice or nectar after a minor ingredient. We will not be able to use strawberry juice, for example, for a drink where the main fruit is actually apple. A further key provision, here in terms of health, is the following: the practice of adding sugar to fruit juices is now prohibited.

Thus, the vote for a directive which aims to limit the use of phosphates represents one step in our struggle to improve water quality and achieve sustainable development.

It should be remembered that phosphates are used in detergents in order to reduce water hardness and to improve washing. However, when they are discharged into lakes and rivers, they promote the growth of algae which kill other aquatic species by depriving them of oxygen (detergents are the third most important source of phosphates discharged into surface waters, after agriculture and sewage, and washing powder is the greatest source of phosphates in the detergents sector). From January 2013, phosphorus compounds used in detergents for washing machines will no longer be able to exceed 0.5 g per wash. These rules will be extended to dishwashers from 2015.

      <p sl="pt">The aim of the current Commission proposal for a regulation is to reduce the amount of phosphorus used in detergents for household washing machines. Phosphates affect water systems, rivers, streams and lakes, causing their eutrophication: that is, an excessive growth of algae which starves other living organisms of oxygen and can also produce toxins, killing fish, plants and other species, as well as reducing the quality of the water itself. Alternatives to phosphates in detergents do exist and, particularly with household laundry detergents, the trend is towards phosphate-free formulations. However, there are also technologies using phosphonates (containing phosphorus, but in much smaller amounts), and, at the moment, these stand in the way of a total ban on phosphorus. Even so, it is essential to set a limit for the maximum amounts of phosphorus that can be used without causing the eutrophication of water systems, rivers, streams and lakes. The Commission opted for a regulation instead of a directive, in order to better harmonise different rules at national levels. The harmonisation of the various national rules regarding phosphates and other phosphate compounds will improve the free circulation of household laundry detergents within the internal market.</p>

They contribute to the faster growth of algae and higher plants, and thus disrupt the ecological balance in our water systems, and particularly in very vulnerable areas such as the Baltic Sea and the Danube basin. In 2010, the Commission submitted an amendment for Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 on detergents introducing a restriction on phosphates and other phosphorus compounds in household washing powders, and the proposal is very welcome. There is, however, another source of phosphates, and that is cleaning products for automatic dishwashers. The general aim of this proposal is, first and foremost, to reduce the negative impacts of these materials on the aquatic environment. At present, however, national legislation in the EU already reflects the trend to move away from using phosphates in detergents, while some Member States are trying to apply restrictions on the use of washing powders, and some states have already introduced restrictions on the use of such products for automatic dishwashers. I welcome the setting of a sensible time period for limits on phosphorous in detergents, which can thereby encourage the necessary innovation, speeding up the transfer to phosphate-free compounds, while at the same time giving enough time to reduce the negative impacts on producers.

We need to restrict the use of phosphates in detergents because an accumulation of them in the water supply causes excess algae growth. Too much algae causes an imbalance in the ecosystem which can result in ecosystem problems such as dead fish. This has been a big problem in the Baltic Sea, but can affect all rivers, lakes and seas. This is a perfect example of why we need a European Union of twenty-seven nations acting together: you cannot control polluted water in one country if it simply appears in another. We all need the same restrictions. Eutrophication is the unhealthy growth of plants leading to an increase in bacteria and lack of oxygen which results in dead fish and, in certain areas of the UK, has led to dead pets such as dogs.

My second reservation is based on common sense: 90% of water eutrophication is caused by other products, not by dishwasher detergents. Therefore, the pollution will continue with or without those detergents. Europe needs to make a great leap forward by legislating on the real issues, not tinkering around the edges: applying the Waste Water Directive more effectively, combating intensive farming and reducing food waste, which are the real culprits when it comes to the eutrophication of European waters.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The aim of the Commission proposal is to reduce the amount of phosphorus used in household laundry detergents and to better harmonise the different rules at national level. Phosphates affect water systems and, in order to clean up Europe’s water, it is desirable to reduce the amount of phosphorus reaching the water of our continent. Fertilisers contain the largest amount of phosphates in the European Union, but they are also found in household dishwasher detergents, in order to combat water hardness and enable efficient cleaning, as well as for other functions to enhance cleaning performance. However, water hardness varies depending on the region, which results in different phosphate formulae among the Member States. It is important to establish rules for reducing the amount of phosphate and to take account of the impact on the different Member States and the various existing conditions, with a view to meeting the targets set.</p>

The background to this is the fact that phosphorus contained in laundry and dishwasher detergents is currently responsible for a large proportion of the pollution of our water bodies. Although there are already phosphate-free liquid laundry detergents, which are increasingly being sold on the market, for dishwashing machines, the market does not currently offer any alternative. Therefore, it is recommended that a specific date be set in the Phosphorus Limitation Regulation in order to create an incentive for the necessary innovation. I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am very pleased that this report on limiting the use of phosphates in household detergents in order to combat eutrophication of water bodies in the natural environment has been passed by Parliament. Eutrophication, which causes the accelerated growth of bacteria, algae and other plant life in a water body, can be a serious environmental problem, killing higher sea life and plants and upsetting the balance of local ecosystems. When eutrophication affects sources of drinking water, there are also risks to public health. Nevertheless, this can be reduced or avoided by limiting the use of phosphates in the detergents we use and switching to alternative ingredients, and these are the aims of this legislation. I am pleased that, because of the input of my Socialist and Democrat colleagues on the ENVI committee, the report was strengthened to include dishwasher detergents, a significant source of phosphates.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In an increasing number of households, the standard appliances include not only a washing machine, but also a dishwasher. We are therefore using considerably more detergents containing large quantities of phosphates. They are discharged into water courses and then into reservoirs, which contributes to excessive nutrient loading. Rapporteur Bill Newton Dunn rightly points out that we should do all we can to reduce the risk of eutrophication, which is associated with a reduction in water transparency, the formation of algae surface coatings and the large-scale perishing of aquatic fauna due to insufficient oxygen and light. Overgrown reservoirs cause a significant deterioration in water taste and smell, which rules them out not only as places of sport or recreation but also, and above all, as a source of drinking water.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The imposition of weight restrictions on the amount of phosphate that may be contained in a dose of detergent is an effective approach which forces manufacturers to market more concentrated, compact products. A solution worth considering would be the use of detergents containing a quantity of phosphate dependent on the hardness of the water in a given area, or the introduction of the large-scale production of phosphate-free detergents. Member States should also make every effort to introduce technologies and appropriate equipment to recover phosphorus, given the rarity of its occurrence as an element.</p>

The EU and Morocco concluded a FPA on 22 May 2006. An outside consultancy prepared an ex-post evaluation report, on behalf of the European Commission, which evaluates the first four years of the FPA with Morocco. On a general note, it states that ‘the results of this first four-year period of the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco are generally rather disappointing’ as the agreement fails to stabilise the EU market and to develop the fisheries sector. Moreover, the population of Western Sahara, the Sahrawi people who suffer under the unlawful and unacceptable occupation of their country by Morocco, does not benefit from this agreement. Morocco has no right to dispose of the natural resources of a territory which does not fall under its sovereignty. For more than 30 years, the Western Sahara’s problem has been dealt with by the United Nations, but without any progress whatsoever. By rejecting the FPA, the European Parliament sent a strong signal to the Moroccan Government that the EU cannot support an agreement with a country which violates human rights.</p>

The agreement conflicts with the rights of the Sahrawi and with international law. The sovereignty of Morocco in the Western Sahara has never been recognised under international law. As, therefore, Morocco is illegally occupying the said area, it has no jurisdiction over its natural resources and, hence, it does not have the right to negotiate agreements against the will and without the opinion of the inhabitants. Moreover, in order for economic activities exploiting natural resources in non-independent territories to be in keeping with international law, said activities must benefit the population of those territories and must be in keeping with its will, which is not the case here. Furthermore, there are serious ecological problems. Many of the marine species in the area are subject to over-exploitation. Some stocks are at risk of complete exhaustion, basically as a result of overfishing by European vessels. Finally, the report evaluating the agreement states that it has not contributed effectively to the development of the fisheries sector and that it does not meet the specific needs of Morocco, either technically or financially. Therefore, not only will suspending it have no serious financial impact; it will also restore the stand that the Union should take.</p>

It is unacceptable that an agreement signed between the European Union and Morocco provides for the exploitation of a natural resource of Western Sahara, a territory illegally occupied by Morocco since 1975. Morocco’s sovereignty over the territory of Western Sahara has never been recognised by any country to this day. With this agreement – contrary both to international law and to various UN resolutions on this issue – the EU does implicitly recognise it. This has therefore been the only solution compatible with international law. The Commission ought to take it very seriously. Its attitude has been deplorable throughout the entire process. It should be noted that Parliament can exercise its right of consent only two months before the scheduled expiry date for the end of this extension, which, in practical terms, started in February.</p>

The agreement gives rise to major ecological concerns: we know that of the 11 demersal stocks fished in Moroccan waters, five appear over-exploited, which casts doubt over the fishing activities of European vessels. This fact causes us to question whether the fisheries agreement limited to surplus stocks is being honoured, considering that these are being almost totally depleted. The last and by no means least important point is the widespread problem of discards, catches of sharks and probable catches of marine mammals by trawlers. Fishing in the waters off Western Sahara is a source of controversy, as Article 73 of the UN Charter defines Western Sahara as a Non-Self-Governing Territory, and Morocco has never been accepted as the official administering power by the UN. Exploitation activities in Western Sahara should, in my opinion, only proceed if they are beneficial for the local population, and it seems that the agreement does not, in its current wording, allow for this.</p>

Continuing the EU’s Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Morocco would be unthinkable, not just for fish stocks, but also in terms of economics and human rights. The evaluation report ordered by the Commission also came to this conclusion. I do understand the position of some of my fellow Members from Mediterranean countries, where the fishing industry has a financial interest in this matter, but, all the same, the facts do not support the agreement. This is what Parliament and the Committees on Budgets and Development have also said in their statements.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The agreement with Morocco is, in financial terms, the second biggest the EU has (EUR 36.1 million a year). In its evaluation report, the Commission stated, for example, that this agreement is economically the least attractive of all the EU’s trade agreements, as we get back just 65 cents for each euro invested. Fish stocks are, furthermore, fully or overexploited.

Parliament’s vote comes more or less at the end of the extended access period. We are therefore faced with a fait accompli . I object to this procedure and am calling for an investigation to establish the exact status of the stocks that many organisations claim are over-fished.

      <p sl="pt">I voted for this regulation and regret the decision by Parliament to refuse the extension of the fisheries agreement between Portugal and Morocco. Several Portuguese vessels are operating in Moroccan territorial waters, and this is having a serious impact on national interests at a time of profound crisis. What is more is that the decision has come at a time when Morocco has introduced reforms for greater democratic openness, particularly following the approval of a new written constitution. The Portuguese vessels used for fishing in Morocco operated under the protection of an agreement signed in 2007 and extended in the following years, but which expired on 28 February. I now expect that the vessels that have paid for their licences, but cannot now exercise their rights, will be duly compensated for the damage caused.</p>

What about the thousands of jobs that have been created on both shores of the Mediterranean? Morocco is a partner on many levels and our rejection of this agreement sends out a very negative signal.

In the particular case of the current agreement, the extension of this Protocol is essential for the EU fleets that are fishing there, especially the Portuguese fleet. It should be remembered that Portuguese vessels had been operating in Moroccan waters for many years thanks, in particular, to the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, which was in force from 1988 to 1999. Portugal was then banned from operating in Moroccan waters, and had to withdraw several dozen vessels, which had irreversible economic and social consequences for many Portuguese fishing communities. In order to prevent such situations from recurring, and taking account of the aims of the external dimension of the CFP, I am voting for this report.</p>

After months of tense and complex negotiations, deliberations and debates, under significant pressure from some governments, such as the governments of Morocco and Spain, Parliament has finally responded coherently and correctly by rejecting this agreement. If we had supported the agreement, we would have infringed international law and trampled all over the rights of the Sahrawi people. We voted against the resolution on three fronts: legal, ecological and economic. Legally, Morocco was negotiating with resources that do not belong to it as Western Sahara is an occupied territory and, consequently, the agreement ignores the rights of the Sahrawi people, thereby infringing international law. Ecologically, fisheries agreements should be based on stocks with surpluses, whereas the stocks in that area suffer from overfishing.

Making use of a bilateral agreement in order to fish in the waters off Western Sahara goes against international law. Moreover, fisheries in occupied Western Sahara are strictly controlled by the Moroccan security services and not by the Sahrawi population. Apart from the indisputable fact that this agreement violates international law, it also emerges from a Commission evaluation report that the agreement constitutes an enormous waste of European taxpayers’ money and contributes to the destruction of fish stocks. It is the most inefficient and wasteful of all the current bilateral fisheries agreements.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Each invested euro of the total of EUR 36 million which the Union pays to Morocco annually gives rise to a negative return of 83%! Moreover, the agreement does not make any contribution whatsoever to the development of the local fishing industry.

I believe that EU fisheries agreements are often flawed in that they encourage industrial fishing on a scale which threatens conservation of marine resources, as well as allowing European fishermen to deprive local fishing communities of a livelihood. In theory, the money paid to the governments of countries like Morocco should flow back to the local people to compensate. In the case of Morocco, this is not the case and indeed Morocco does not respect the UN resolutions granting the right of self-determination to the Western Saharan people through a plebiscite and has not compensated the Sahrawi people for their loss of fishing rights in proportion to the size of the Western Saharan coastline.

The reason for this is that the Danish Social Democrats have a general policy not to vote for the political resolutions of other political groups. Moreover, the resolution places far too little emphasis on the economic and environmental shortcomings in the current interim protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Morocco. A new and better protocol must include clear improvements with regard to the economic and environmental aspects.

      <p sl="pt">Due to its privileged location in North Africa, the Kingdom of Morocco has a vast exclusive sea area, which has been coveted throughout history by various fishing fleets, including European ones. The near continuity of our territories motivated the establishment of privileged economic relations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco, which became the greatest beneficiary of EU funds under the European Neighbourhood Policy, while Europe became the primary destination for its exports. Sadly, Parliament has just prevented an extension of the Partnership Agreement with Morocco. However, we cannot continue for much longer without a new agreement, otherwise the European fishing fleets that operate in Moroccan waters will go bankrupt and support for Moroccan development will be cancelled. Accordingly, I advocate moving forward with new negotiations to establish a new agreement between the EU and Morocco. I therefore urge the Commission to prepare a new economically, environmentally and socially sustainable agreement with Morocco as soon as possible in order for support to continue to the Moroccan population, which is so dependent on this support, and so that the fishing fleets licensed to fish in that region can resume their operations.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The Kingdom of Morocco is an African country with almost 32 million inhabitants. Morocco is currently a privileged partner of the EU and the largest recipient of EU funds under the European Neighbourhood Policy. The EU is Morocco’s most important export market, its leading public and private external investor and its most important tourism market. The fishing industry has been an important economic pillar for Morocco for a long time, and the country is considered to be the largest fish market in Africa, with the fishing sector accounting for an estimated 400 000 jobs. The European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco concluded a Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) on 22 May 2006 which entered into force on 28 February 2007.

In 2010, the Commission asked Morocco to evaluate the situation and consider what future action could be taken to improve the partnership on fisheries. As a longstanding partner of the European Union, Morocco bent itself to the task and proved that the fisheries agreement had generated benefits in the form of job creation throughout Morocco and for the Sahrawi people. In environmental terms, around 40% of the financial assistance provided under the agreement feeds back into conserving fish stocks and developing the fishing sector.

European countries are already incapable of carrying out military operations (example, recent Libya intervention) without US support, whose share of all defence spending within NATO has risen to 75%. I agree with the rapporteur that the financial crisis is a global phenomenon and it has also touched the defence sector. There is a common tendency to cut spending on defence in the Member States, which is the subject of our concern. It is true that maintaining these expenditures, when we are in a financial crisis, where there are social pressures, is not an easy task.

The Member States collectively spend about EUR 200 billion a year on defence. The spending of most of these funds in the Member States is based on uncoordinated national defence planning decisions, which results not only in persistent capability gaps, but frequently also in wasteful overcapacities and duplications, as well as fragmented industry and markets. In recent times, there have been cuts to the defence budgets of the majority of EU Member States in the wake of the financial, economic and debt crisis. This may have a negative impact on Member States’ military capabilities and on the ability of the EU to fulfil its obligations as regards peacekeeping, conflict prevention and the strengthening of international security. I welcome Parliament’s position that the Member States must seek to compensate for the negative impact of the financial crisis on the defence sector in the EU Member States through increased European cooperation and coordination.

There is therefore no need to duplicate them within the Union. I am also sceptical about the possibility of implementing these initiatives as a complement to the coordination of the NATO defence planning process. The Member States spend a total of over EUR 200 billion per year on defence, and this is only one third of the defence spending of the United States, which, at the same time, covers three quarters of NATO’s budget. With excessively low expenditure and, above all, the waste of funds, European members of the Alliance could threaten its continued existence, and this, above all, should focus our attention.</p>

This European Parliament own-initiative report was drawn up because there has been a trend in recent times of increasing cuts to the defence budgets of the majority of EU Member States due to the crisis and this is not being coordinated at EU level. As the European Parliament report notes, the security environment both in Europe and worldwide is becoming increasingly complex and unpredictable, and it is therefore proposed that European defence capabilities should be maintained at their pre-crisis level and that we should also rely less on the United States to fund defence spending in the North Atlantic Alliance. The latter aspect in particular is stressed in the report because it is felt that a reinforced European defence capability will enhance the strategic autonomy of the EU and provide an important contribution to collective security in the context of NATO and other partnerships.</p>

A certain amount of coordination is clearly required at EU level in terms of budget reductions in this area to show the extent of EU military capabilities. On the other hand, the economic crisis is also a good teacher. All European states have learnt fairly important lessons from it. One of these could be that better defence coordination is required at European Union level.</p>

At a time when the people of Europe are suffering the consequences of the crisis, this specific report helps to serve the interests of the arms industry. By proposing that the arms industry be developed as a way of resolving the unemployment problem, it is endeavouring to intertwine the fate of the people of Europe with the production and export of arms that end up in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel and elsewhere, thereby promoting interests foreign to the people. In perfect keeping with the ‘security’ philosophy, the report is in favour, among other things, of upgrading the operation of NATO and of the Union within it. It gives priority to the military side of the Union and encourages the correlation and equation of civil and military resources, regardless of whether they concern technical infrastructures or research or Union action. The Union must channel resources into social spending and public investments and must formulate its foreign policy on the basis of international law and peaceful principles, instead of providing a profit for the mass production of arms.</p>

This is why we must spend the money earmarked for defence with the utmost care on well-defined programmes intended to address the challenges which we need to face.

I consider it important to emphasise that defence is a public asset influencing the security of all European citizens, and all Member States must contribute to it in a spirit of cooperation, burden sharing and cost efficiency. In a more complex and unpredictable security environment, it is desirable for all Member States to cooperate more closely and coordinate their steps against the common threats mentioned in the European security strategy, and to take on their full share of responsibility for peace and security in Europe, the neighbouring regions and the world.

In the present economic crisis, the constant defence spending cuts may seem unavoidable, but it is only in complicated situations that we understand that this is not the ideal solution from the point of view of defensive capability. Most European countries have significantly reduced their defensive capabilities since the end of the Cold War, presuming that different wars would remain a thing of the distant past and that the future would be bright. I also believe in a brighter future, one of the foundations of which is the European Union. In order to defend our values, however, we must consider different threats. I consider the present situation, in which Europe primarily relies on NATO’s greatest military power – the United States, consuming security that it does not particularly wish to pay for, to be irresponsible. However, what happens when US taxpayers cease to consider this to be reasonable – after all, they have their own concerns. Present experience in Libya has shown that European countries can no longer cope with events in their near vicinity without US assistance. Only a few countries on the outer borders of the EU, such as Greece and Poland that have a stronger sense of various threats, have contributed more than the average amount to our common security, and my home country of Estonia has also raised its defence expenditures to 2% of GDP. Of course it is not only the amount spent that is important, but how it is spent. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid duplication between Member States by increasing effectiveness and harmonising EU defence policy. Greater unity within Europe will ensure that we are taken seriously and deter those who dare to question our values.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution because a common defence industrial policy makes sense economically in terms of reinforcing the role of the European Union worldwide and maintaining Europe’s technological capacity while still taking account of the particular characteristics of each Member State. Attention should be drawn to the fact that a reinforced European defence capability will contribute to collective security in the context of various partnerships, including NATO. I believe that the Member States should implement permanent structured cooperation and define the conditions for the application of solidarity and mutual defence clauses, while improving the transparency and openness of their defence markets. I welcome the proposal that the EU should jointly acquire the most expensive and up-to-date equipment and establish a civil-military EU Operational Headquarters which will not only support international peace and security but will also generate savings for national budgets. It should be noted that research and innovation play a particularly important role in the security and defence sector. Consequently, it is very important to do our utmost to increase synergies between European defence and civilian security research programmes and to enhance the development and independence of these programmes. I believe that the European defence industry and technological base will contribute to the creation of new jobs in this industrial sector.</p>

The defence sector is undoubtedly one of those most severely affected by the austerity policies implemented as a result of the economic crisis. At this rate, Europe risks being unable to shoulder its international responsibilities and seeing some of its traditional areas of strategic weakness, such as duplication of military capabilities and its inability to carry out operations without US support, intensify.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order to prevent such a scenario from occurring, and to avoid draining funds from other important expenditure headings, the only effective solution, as the report indicates, is to move towards greater cooperation within the Union, with due respect for national prerogatives. This cooperation should cover all areas of defence but, in particular, contract liberalisation, technological research, coordination of planning and sharing of certain capabilities. Greater collaboration would, moreover, enable European countries to strengthen their own strategic autonomy and increase their political influence within the Atlantic Alliance.</p>

There is a variety of reasons for this: to the most basic reference to the budgetary weaknesses experienced by various States can be added the lack of integration between the defence policies of the different Member States. In truth, coordinating policy between the various Member States would allow resources to be used more optimally and allow a true European defence force to be created, based on the complementarity of the armed forces of the different States. The rapporteur highlights six priority areas: better coordination of defence planning, pooling and sharing of capabilities, support for research and technological development, construction of a European Defence Technological and Industrial Base, creation of a European market in defence equipment and, finally, seeking new forms of funding.

This report, which I voted in favour of, proposes several measures which I think are reasonable, including the pooling and sharing of capabilities in areas having limited impact on sovereignty: logistical support, maintenance, medical support, among others. European funds should be used to enhance cooperation at the level of education and training.

It derives from the evolution of our respective peoples, the rise and fall of empires, the links between the royal families, culture, the arts, writers, religions, especially Christianity, military combat against fascism, positioning in respect of communism, and so on.

It highlights electoral fraud more to seize the opportunity to try to destabilise Russia than because of concerns about democracy. In practice, they intend to engineer political changes favourable to their interests, as happened in other countries in Eastern Europe.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Despite the serious and far-reaching consequences of the economic crisis, relations between the European Union and Russia have continued to evolve in recent decades. They are moving towards a complex economic integration and interdependence, and this can be expected to develop further in the future. The conclusion of a strategic partnership agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation is of key significance for the further development and intensification of cooperation between the two partners. For example, security of energy supplies is one of the greatest challenges for Europe, and one of the main areas of cooperation with Russia. Their joint effort should be directed towards the efficient use of energy and energy systems, and towards continuing the appropriate development of this effort. In another area, however, developments in the Russian Federation regarding the observance and protection of human rights and respect for commonly agreed democratic principles, rules and procedures are still a cause for concern. The Russian Federation, as a full member of the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the United Nations, is committed to the principles of democracy and human rights. I take the view that it is important and necessary to respect these principles.</p>

Russia is undeniably a key partner of the European Union with which we need to strengthen our cooperation in the energy sector while combating climate change, our trade and our negotiations for the resolution of conflicts throughout the world and closer to home. However, in accordance with our principles and values, but also for the security and stability of our neighbourhood, the EU’s stance towards the violations, by Russia, of the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights, the irregularities reported during the latest elections and the ensuing crackdown on demonstrators, must be strong, particularly with regard to conditionalities, in the framework of a possible acceleration of the pace of negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement.</p>

Such a situation will present a serious obstacle to the EU-Russia Partnership Agreement. Obviously, the EU cannot complete the agreement while the Russian Government is breaking international agreements with the Council of Europe and the OSCE, and is selectively implementing the Energy Charter Treaty. Mr Putin’s Russia has not proved to be a reliable partner with which the EU can be sure to stand on common ground. Instead, the EU needs to demonstrate solidarity with the Russian people and support their demands for fair elections and the rule of law.

The last legislative elections were widely criticised for failing to respect proper procedures and ensure the transparency of the results. Respect for democracy is also based on establishing elections that are worthy of the name, freedom of expression, a free political opposition, and freedom of association and demonstration.

We can seek Russia’s friendship but how far are we ready to go to get it? It is hard to imagine the lifting of visa requirements with a country whose state structures protect people who are guilty of crimes against humanity, such as the case of Mikhail Golovatov, while Russia refuses to cooperate in such categories of cases as 13 January and the Medininkai killings, while there is a lack of substantial progress in the case of Sergei Magnitsky and while Mikhail Khodorkovsky is imprisoned.

It can also be seen that these two regions are privileged economic partners, particularly in the energy sector, and that Russia, beyond the links it has with Europe, is, above all, one of the great world powers. All of these elements must be present in the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit, and the EU’s action there should be marked by the following conditions: as an economic partner, the EU must enhance the relationship between the two regions, and as a political partner, or neighbouring political region, it must act in support of fair, democratic elections and the rule of law based on the primacy of the individual.

Following repeated criticism from the OSCE and EU institutions of the critical human rights situation in that country, of the electoral law and politically motivated court decisions, the European Court of Human Rights this year voiced criticism of the cumbersome procedure for the registration of political parties in Russia. For all that, the elections to the Russian State Duma on 4 December and the oppressive response of the authorities to the subsequent widespread popular protests again highlighted the severe situation with regard to democracy and human rights in Russia, as evidenced by the reports of widespread violations from the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.

The European path for the development of our partners and their commitment to democratisation must have our active and full support. Sustainable economic and social development and the formation and activities of open, democratic political parties and non-governmental organisations also consolidate relations with Brussels and help these countries flourish. Accelerating reform is possible through association agreements, which is why it is so important to conduct negotiations smoothly and quickly. The implementation of this policy must be based on respect for the equality of all partner countries. Another issue of great importance is that of respect for human rights. The need for specific action for the democratisation of Belarus should also be stressed.</p>

      <p sl="it">Several parts of the report on neighbourhood policy stress that we should facilitate immigration from countries bordering the Member States. According to the rapporteurs, we must improve conditions for the entry of legal migrants into Europe and facilitate immigration itself by concluding mobility partnerships which take proper account of the demographic, social and occupational situation in both the country of origin and the country of destination.</p>
      <p sl="it">Moreover, we should view immigration as an opportunity, and not so much in terms of its possible repercussions on security. We therefore ought to facilitate entry visa liberalisation with a view to moving towards freedom of movement, acting in any case so as to make the issue of visas as easy as possible.</p>
      <p sl="it">The basic principle, namely, that immigration must be seen as an opportunity, regardless of the repercussions on security and the socio-economic fabric of our countries, is one that I cannot agree with. I am also opposed to the basic policy proposed by the report, which aims to facilitate the issue of visas and entry procedures into Europe for immigrants from bordering and neighbour countries.

The European Parliament’s report in particular adheres to the principle of ‘more for more’ and ‘less for less’ proposed by the Commission, which means closer cooperation with the European Union for those neighbouring countries that successfully and actively implement democratic reforms in their countries, and the opposite, the cooling of relations with the EU, for countries that refuse to implement or delay the implementation of the reforms mentioned. As a general provision, I also support the idea that this tool for the exertion of diplomatic pressure is appropriate for encouraging the development of democratic processes in neighbouring countries, but we must act very carefully to ensure that such measures do not harm ordinary citizens in these countries. Indeed, I believe that any assistance and measures focused on strengthening civil society in these countries and, at the same time, putting pressure on the leadership of undemocratic regimes will enable us to achieve the best results by strengthening democracy in neighbouring countries.</p>

The EU is a living organism that learns from its own failures and mistakes. This is why the European Neighbourhood Policy must obviously be based mainly on values, in other words, on zero tolerance of authoritarian regimes in the southern neighbourhood. We need to move beyond security and immigration control when it comes to non-EU states located on the other side of the Mediterranean and add an important cooperation element to the neighbourhood policy which gives priority to democracy and prosperity.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The states neighbouring the EU have recently been faced with political and social challenges, on top of the economic ones. Apart from the humanitarian objectives, there is a pragmatic objective to help these states to reduce unemployment rates and offer some hope for the future to the population living in the states neighbouring the EU. The EU must foster the European aspirations of some of its non-EU partners and galvanise their commitment to build lasting democracy. To be able to encourage them, a prompt review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is required.</p>

Migratory issues between the Union and its neighbouring countries cannot be reduced to the security priorities of the EU. It is essential to improve the management and maximise the mutual benefits of migration for development, providing new ways and better conditions for the establishment of legal migrants in the EU and taking account of the demographic, sociological and professional balance on both sides, while at the same time combating the root causes of irregular migration in third countries, and taking judicial action against organisations involved in human trafficking.</p>

I can only be thrilled with this support and recall that it was the Parliament resolution on the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) of 19 January 2005 that first recognised the uniqueness and historical, geographical and linguistic proximity of Cape Verde to the Union and promoted the adoption of European policies aimed at this country.</p>

The objective of the ENP is to support the development of neighbouring countries without imposing set formulas. However, even as the EU provides financial support, it must continue to demand that these countries make certain commitments, such as respect for human rights and for the freedoms and guarantees of their citizens, the implementation of good governance and of the rule of law, combating corruption, ensuring respect for minorities, environmental protection, and so on. The EU must maintain its contact with neighbouring countries, as we need external borders that are secure yet open to democracy, tolerance and respect.

There are no funds for expanding the programmes or funds for social problems within the EU or beyond, but there are funds – and they are growing – for policies that are not aimed at promoting respect and mutual interests between countries, but are rather aimed at achieving the liberalisation of investment and the control of natural resources and markets by big business in the major EU powers.

The overthrow of long-entrenched repressive regimes in Egypt and Tunisia, the continuing military conflict in Libya, the recent crackdown in Syria, the continuing repression in Belarus and the unceasing and long-running conflicts in this region, including the Middle East, demand a reassessment of the EU’s relationship with its neighbours. We must also encourage the positive progress achieved by other neighbours, such as, for example, Moldova with its reforms, Ukraine in the talks on an association agreement, or Morocco and Jordan in their communications on constitutional reforms. The Lisbon Treaty gives the EU the opportunity to strengthen its foreign policy. Cooperation with neighbouring countries can now be expanded, thus covering a broader range of issues in a simpler and more effective way. This possibility was the main impulse for initiating the revision of the European Neighbourhood Policy in the summer of 2010, following consultation with the partner countries and other stakeholders.

Migration is a natural phenomenon linked to the human condition. The revised European Neighbourhood Policy is duty bound to establish favourable conditions for partnerships with third countries, bearing in mind the sometimes dramatic situations that affect them. The EU has everything to gain from promoting initiatives that aim to inform migrants of their rights as well as their responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Given the dramatic changes in the south, it was necessary to review the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) for mutually beneficial cooperation between the EU and its partners according to the principle of ‘more for more’. I welcome the Commission’s proposal to increase ENP funding by 23% in the new multiannual financial framework. However, we must strike the right balance between the two flanks of the ENP. The Arab Spring has captured political attention all year long. The EU must support development in these countries and the development of civil society, help to restore infrastructure and encourage the processes of democracy and the rule of law in such a way as to keep open the window of opportunity for democracy. Nevertheless, the EU should play the role of sponsor of the relevant reforms, rather than that of instigator. The revolutions have given citizens a greater voice and they must feel that they are in control of the reforms. We must not abandon our eastern neighbours to chance. Many of them are fulfilling their European perspective and making progress carrying out European reforms – we must recognise and assess these efforts. Let us not forget that in the Eastern neighbourhood, many aspects relate to the EU-Russia dialogue, involving issues such as the visa waiver. Decisions must only be adopted on the basis of objective criteria and real progress.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Neighbourhood Policy is relatively new – it was established in 2004. In its short history, however, it has encountered a number of challenges. These include, for example, the political upheavals in the so-called Arab Spring countries, the repression in Belarus and the final phase of the integration of Croatia. I quite agree with my colleagues – the rapporteurs – that the basic conditions applying to democratic reforms – respect for human rights and adherence to the rule of law – must be set out clearly for the European neighbourhood countries. The EU has very few effective instruments for shaping its surrounding environment. The effective use of so-called soft power within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy is one of the few ways to influence neighbouring countries positively with their integration into the EU, or with enhanced cooperation. A policy of ‘more for more’ and especially ‘less for less’ is perhaps one way in which we might penalise any non-compliance with the EU’s key objectives.</p>

The sense of security among the European population has decreased significantly following the attacks on European soil, such as the one in Madrid in 2004 or London in 2005. The fight against terrorism therefore requires a coordinated international response and a global approach based on intelligence, police, the judiciary, political instruments and, in exceptional circumstances, military ones too. The EU’s counter-terrorism policy must therefore be in line with its foreign policy and internal security strategy. Nevertheless, especially at a time when the neighbouring Arab countries have moved closer to democracy, the EU has a duty to serve as a moral compass, and not only for its own citizens.

This document, quoted by the rapporteur, proves that ‘the threat of terrorist attacks in the EU remains serious, and that the links between terrorism and organised crime appear to be growing’. It was, therefore, with satisfaction that I received the Commission communication, although like the rapporteur, I feel that it should be more closely linked to the internal security strategy and that it could have been even more comprehensive, especially in regard to creating conditions aimed at greater coordination and cohesion between EU policies and the policies of each of the Member States, and even at international level. From the text of the report, I would also like to emphasise the idea that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should, in principle, act as a reference for the policies of the EU and its Member States in this area, as well as in regard to cooperation with third parties and countries. In view of what I said earlier and the scope and relevance of the report, I voted in favour.</p>

Police and judicial cooperation between Member States has therefore been developed, with one of its aims being to combat terrorism. Nevertheless, although the EU does need a high-quality counter-terrorism mechanism, it is just as important for its cost, its effectiveness and its impact on the civil freedoms of European citizens to be assessed. So far, there are no studies that provide a comprehensive list of the European counter-terrorism policies established since 2001. That is why the Commission should publish a full, detailed assessment indicating the cost, the concrete results and the procedures used for monitoring the European counter-terrorism policies that are currently in force. The actions carried out as part of the fight against terrorism should come under democratic scrutiny, with an assessment of everything from their conception to the real impact they have on the daily lives of EU citizens.</p>

Next came the attacks on Madrid and London, which brought the terror within our borders with a level of violence never before seen on European soil.

Yet, as we have seen, in this first decade of the 21st century, technology was the vehicle for what is considered to be the most severe and violent terrorist attack of all time: the attacks of 11 September on the United States. However, Europe did not remain unscathed. In 2004, there were attacks in Madrid, and in 2005 in London, not to mention what happened this summer in Norway, and, during this very plenary, in Belgium. In addition, there has been religious terrorism, especially in the Islamic countries, such as the events in Egypt. The feeling of insecurity among the public is great and no one can guarantee that he or she is safe from a terrorist attack. This is an enormous threat to international stability and calls for a response on a global scale, because it is a scourge that knows no borders. International cooperation at the level of a good intelligence network, along with an effective police, judicial, political and – in some circumstances – military system, could help to weaken terrorist activity.

      <p sl="sk">In the EU strategy for combating terrorism and the action plan being implemented, a broad approach is applied when defining the measures and instruments that may contribute to combating terrorism. One of the main challenges is to prevent the radicalisation and recruitment that leads to a willingness to commit terrorist acts. The Europol Terrorism Situation and Trend Report for 2010 shows that many terrorist and extremist organisations are supported by active organised groups of young people, who represent a major problem in some states as potential disseminators of radicalisation and terrorist recruitment. Extremist ideologies continue to attract attention from unstable people who are inclined to commit criminal acts, and the risks associated with the radicalisation of young people are still large. In recent years, the EU has introduced many important political measures aimed at preventing radicalisation and terrorist recruitment, and efforts to implement and support these measures continue. I firmly believe that it is vitally necessary always to achieve the best possible balance between, on the one hand, the duty to protect citizens from harm and guarantee their safety, and, on the other, to respect and preserve their individual rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">My reservations to the report are twofold: a matter of both principle and practical approach. The text’s tone is infiltrated and determined by prejudices and accusations that counter-terrorism simply keeps violating human rights, that it operates with excessive budgets and exaggerates threats. These propagandistic concepts are based on hypotheses to which no evidence was provided by the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="en">On the other hand, goals laid down in the report are hardly feasible in practice. One example of many: with data being classified for security reasons, to what extent and on which benchmarks should the proportionality between the cost of a preventive counter terrorism operation and the threat level be assessed?</p>
      <p sl="en">Why does the rapporteur believe that either secret services of Member States or EU security agencies would grant civilians access to their most sensitive data, thus putting European security at risk?

Counter-terrorism also requires a comprehensive approach based on every means available: intelligence, police, judiciary, political and, in some cases, even military.

This they have done, even though there is still no proof that this whole stack of information can in any way guarantee the success in the combating of terrorism that is being used to justify the circumventing of elementary fundamental rights. Instead of spying on EU citizens, it would be better for the EU to devote more attention once again to combating organised crime, which is flourishing, and promoting projects that are important for security like the Schengen Information System.

It is on this basis that we must endeavour to understand this phenomenon. The EU Member States should devise a joint policy that will enable them to confront this problem effectively without sacrificing their fundamental axiological framework of respect for individual rights, requiring any measure taken to pass the test of proportionality.

However, we need a full evaluation of what impact these measures have for democratic scrutiny and civil liberties, and we also need to look at the cost-effectiveness of EU counter-terrorism policy. I support calls for the Commission to draft a report on the financial implications of the policy by looking at how and where the money is spent. I also believe it is important to examine budget lines created since 2001 relevant to counter-terrorism research funding.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, can I start by thanking colleagues that have worked with me on this dossier for what seems a very long time now. There may be some differences between most of us and the European People’s Party, but I am sure that we can overcome those differences in the long term.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will put this debate in context, because it is not only about access to documents. The debate is about the pre-condition of democracy: access to documents is, according to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, fundamental to citizens, and therefore any exceptions to that right have to be narrowly defined and justified. Only through transparency can citizens participate in an informed way in the democratic process, which is even more important in the current crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">What we are talking about is a right that allows citizens and their representatives outside Parliament and the institutions to make sure that we are accountable: parliamentarians accountable for what we do in their name; the Commission accountable for what they do; and equally the Council of Ministers accountable, too.</p>
      <p sl="en">As we know, meetings of the Council of Ministers currently take place behind closed doors. If we knew how our Ministers and our Prime Ministers vote in their secret meetings, we would be able to hold them to account in the national parliaments – hold them to account not on how they report but what they say in those meetings and how they vote. It would also, I believe, destroy the media myth that unpopular measures from Brussels are imposed on national governments, whereas the contrary is true. National governments have to agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is also about building trust between the EU and its citizens, whereby a mixing of concepts from Member States and EU should be avoided. That is why I believe that at EU level, we should become a model for our Member States on transparency. I will use the remaining amount of my time at the end of the debate to respond to any points and to any questions that arise during the debate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents is an important right for citizens and it is our responsibility to make such access as broad and as easy as possible. At the same time, we are the guardians of other fundamental rights, such as the privacy of individuals or the protection of intellectual property rights. None of these rights can claim precedence over the others, and we must protect them all; therefore, our institutions have the responsibility to strike the right balance amongst sometimes competing interests. Our proposal from 2008 reflects this delicate balance.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two-and-a-half years ago, we discussed the first report presented by rapporteur Mr Cashman. At that time, the European Parliament decided not to vote on the draft legislative resolution and to refer the report back to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. Regrettably, no real progress was made since, despite my standing offer to have a genuine dialogue on the core elements of our proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, the Lisbon Treaty has entered into force and required adjustment to the 2008 Commission proposal. This was duly highlighted in our communication on the consequences for pending proposals of the entry into force of the Treaty, where we suggested that these adjustments were included in the ongoing legislative process.</p>
      <p sl="en">As there was no progress, the Commission decided in March this year to submit a separate proposal with a view to making the current regulation compliant with the new Treaty. Let me be very clear. The extension of the scope to all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies is a legal obligation under the Treaty and therefore should not be controversial. This is why I have suggested a swift and separate discussion on this rather technical amendment, leaving the door open for further discussions on other changes to the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">I regret that this pragmatic and constructive two-step approach has not been followed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and that the report we are discussing today actually merges the two Commission proposals. This means that the implementation of the legal obligations under the Treaty, the actual creation of a new right for citizens, is now being postponed until the three institutions agree on full-scale review of the regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, citizens will have no full, formal access to documents coming, for example, from the European Council or the External Action Service. This agreement risks taking time and I am afraid that, given the amendments proposed in the report, agreement on changes to the regulations is not within reach. I cannot, of course, anticipate the position the Council will take on the proposed amendments but many of them cannot be accepted by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, and because the Lisbon Treaty has extended the principle of access to documents to all institutions, bodies, agencies and offices of the EU, any common set of rules needs to feed a greater number of bodies with very different mandates and competences and this requires a sufficient degree of flexibility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposed amendments do not go, however, in this direction and some of the amendments would even significantly weaken the protection of legitimate interests. For example: no exception to refuse access would apply to legislative documents. It means we would need to grant access to early drafts of legislation and to legal opinions. The institutions would simply have no space to think. This is going too far in our view and we cannot rule out the need to protect a document at least temporarily.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another example concerns non-legislative documents where legal advice would no longer be protected if the rapporteur’s amendments are carried through. Finally, it would also be impossible to protect personal data or sensitive documents after 30 years. Besides protecting legitimate interests and a space to think, we must also ensure that the regulation is used to disclose documents to the public in the public interest, and I would underline and repeat: in the public interest. This is its ultimate objective.</p>
      <p sl="en">From our experience, however, the regulation is regularly misused by lobbyists or law firms with a view to obtaining information serving their own private interests. As these requests mostly concern very voluminous files – 50 000 pages is not an exception – the Commission considers that the handling of such requests is excessively resource-consuming, with no added value for citizens. Therefore, the Commission proposes some clarification to the scope of the regulation. These proposals would not affect legitimate requests and our estimates would not impact on the numbers of the requests granted. They are aimed at better protecting public resources and a well functioning administration, but they have now been simply removed from the report with no clear justification.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, a substantial number of amendments concern provisions of the regulation which the Commission did not propose to amend. We are not adopting a new regulation but amending an existing one, using recasting. I simply recall that the scope for substantive changes open to the legislator is bound to follow those parts included in the Commission’s proposal. Such is the agreement between the three institutions on recasting, which dates from 2003.</p>
      <p sl="en">To sum up, the Commission will look carefully at the amendments that will be voted by this Parliament but, let me be very clear, many cannot be accepted by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">Though disappointed by the lack of progress so far, I hope that a real constructive dialogue can take place between the three institutions after the vote, with a view to reaching an agreement. I would also like to repeat what I have said on previous occasions. The regulation is part of the EU policy on transparency but we can do a lot beyond formal legislation: we can improve registers; we can improve user-friendliness and accessibility; we can be more active in dissemination and documents can be published faster. I can bring some more examples. The real objective of transparency is to bring our institutions closer to citizens through an active policy of informing them and making them aware of how Europe-wide policies are elaborated and may affect their daily lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to the constructive and thought-provoking discussions to come. The subject deserves it and our citizens are entitled to expect a clear and well-functioning legislation on public access to our documents.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, for his excellent levels of cooperation while the report was being drafted.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Recent years have shown us that it is very difficult to make any progress in the area of transparency at EU level. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force a good two years ago, emphasised the importance of transparency, but, unfortunately, it has not yet materialised at any practical level. I particularly lament the fact that, despite all it has said about the importance of transparency, the Commission has not consented to issue any proposals that might have increased it. On the contrary, its proposal that was presented in 2008 would have limited and lowered levels of transparency. I think that was very regrettable.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Despite everything, Parliament has been able to amend this proposal by the Commission, and now, in any case, we cannot go back, so, instead, we should take a few step forwards, in accordance with this present proposal by the Committee. It is unfortunate that the largest group in the European Parliament, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), opposes these proposals and increased transparency, and voted against the entire report. Hopefully, however, tomorrow, when we have the vote, the situation will alter.</p>
      <p sl="fi">In my opinion, it is important that ordinary people have access to information. Commissioner Šefčovič mentioned here that a problem exists with respect to access to summit meeting documents, for example. Now I would like to raise another timely issue, which is the transparency of the European Stability Mechanism: for example, the Court of Auditors of the European Union is unable to access its documents or perform an audit, another case of a lack of transparency, as in so many other matters.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Let us hope that we can take a few small steps forward, and that, in future talks, there will be an emphasis on transparency and a public approach to issues, and that we will find consensus.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Madam President, any initiative that urges the extension of transparency and the development of good administrative techniques is a welcome one. In times fraught with crisis, it is a fundamental interest of citizens to have a clear picture of what aspects and facts underlie political debates and institutional decisions. However, if we were to extend access to information to just about everything and intended to implement this by somewhat propagandistic exaggerations, then our noble gestures could easily achieve the opposite effect.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Access to documents cannot be without limits. It cannot extend to cases where access to information would violate other fundamental rights, by which I particularly mean sensitive personal rights or, from a different perspective, security-related Community rights and interests. Therefore, if such access would violate or impair the aforesaid, this inherently valuable effort itself could turn to the wrong side. The balance of our fundamental rights must not be overturned, since they are one of the guarantees of European democracies. This is one of the reasons why I sincerely regret that we cannot support this otherwise important and respectable report by Mr Cashman, as in our opinion, its concept is exaggerated and one-sided on many points. Still, I sincerely regret this because its basic objective is very important.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, there is no doubt that this House supports transparency and openness towards citizens. Obviously, my group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), does so, too. However, this report goes way beyond the actual goal. Existing legislation and interinstitutional agreements are ignored and the protection of competition cases and sensitive and personal data is treated with contempt. Among other things, this massively violates data protection, which we so vehemently support in other contexts. Are we now to sacrifice the privacy of the global population? This is precisely the risk we face with this report, because administrative procedures and decisions, which also include personnel matters, for example, are to be made public. The same applies to the protection of business secrets and sensitive information within the framework of approval procedures, court cases and competition cases.</p>
      <p sl="de">With its definitions that are vague, far too broad and lacking in clarity, the report also allows public access to these types of documents, as documents are taken to mean any data or content connected in any way with the policies, measures and decisions of all bodies and institutions of the EU. This largely also includes preparatory, confidential and secret documents, as well as all associated information. Thus, the definition covers not only documents, but also information. Even information from ongoing interinstitutional processes, such as informal trialogue negotiations, will have to be made public.</p>
      <p sl="de">Do you really know what that means, Mr Cashman? It means public access to procedures. It means public influence on the decision-making process. In that case, we might just as well sit the lobbyists at the table and let them negotiate! Is that what citizens want? I cannot believe that that is the case.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, documents relating to non-legislative procedures – measures dealing with internal organisation and so on – are also to be made public. Where is the public interest in that? Is this not more likely to obstruct our work?</p>
      <p sl="de">This report is not in the interests of our citizens. It will result in a flood of useless information. It will make our work impossible and, above all, it is unacceptable to the other institutions because it contravenes current legislation. You are aware of that, Mr Cashman, and by doing this you are essentially working against greater transparency and against the citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, in contrast to the previous speaker, I believe that the transparency of the legislative process of the EU is something, according to my group, without which there can be no talk of legitimate European institutions or EU democracy as such.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Today, we must, unfortunately, state that the Commission has failed to respond sufficiently in the current draft regulation to the new framework of the Lisbon Treaty and, in some respects, the draft regulation is more limited than the previous version. The most notable step is the reformulated definition of ‘document’ in Article 3, the concept that lies at the very heart of the regulation. In our opinion, instead of narrowing the definition of the concept of ‘document’, it should be expanded to include official information. The access of applicants to specific pieces of information would make it possible to request particular information in a more precise, targeted and comprehensive way. It would also avoid the receipt of large quantities of unnecessary information, provision of which entails additional cost. The new definition could also make it easier to get partial access to certain classified documents, and would make it possible to clearly differentiate between unofficial and official information.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Mr Šefčovič, I have no doubt at all that the provision of full access to all the documents of closed infringement proceedings is also extremely important to you. In our opinion, however, the Commission proposal, which gives Member States the right to refuse access to documents on the basis of their laws, is contrary to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and it is therefore unacceptable to us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, I first of all wish to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work and, in particular, for his great patience.</p>
      <p sl="it">As we all know, democracy is based on making legislative work public, on the transparency of the decision-making process, and on the people’s right to make informed decisions. For this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Treaties have proclaimed the fundamental right to access documents and information.</p>
      <p sl="it">This right must be guaranteed for all citizens, from local to international levels, in order to ensure that the institutions carry out the task for which they were created: to work on the citizens’ behalf in a transparent manner. Transparency is essential to prevent and combat corruption and the infiltration of the institutions at all levels by organised crime and powerful interests.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am particularly satisfied because the report on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding access to documents has accepted some important amendments which I submitted, in particular, those on financial and budgetary transparency, on the beneficiaries of European funds, on how EU money is spent, and on how European policies are implemented, all of which can be accessed via a database on the Internet.</p>
      <p sl="it">Other amendments submitted by me are included in the report, establishing rules for accessing information in electronic format contained in European databases, rules to limit exceptions to document access, especially when they refer to European legislative procedures, and rules for overriding the power of Member States to veto the publication of documents.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ALDE Group will therefore vote in favour of the Cashman report and I hope that the majority of this Parliament will support it, despite the opposition of some Members who have induced their groups to follow the interests of economic bureaucratic and industrial lobbies or those entrenched in the defence of the class and its secrets.</p>
      <p sl="it">The ALDE Group moreover asks the European Commission and Council to accept the proposals of the European Parliament and, under the Danish Presidency, to launch negotiations so as to finally take the necessary steps forward to assert the fundamental and democratic right of citizens to acquire the knowledge they require in order to make their decisions.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, democracy is not easy. A democracy demands openness. Democracy demands that people are able to check whether a decision taken on their behalf is the right decision. We now no longer have a direct democracy but rather representatives of the people, and we have ministers in institutions such as the European Council. However, it is still of the utmost importance that what we do is checked by another person. And it would seem that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) still wants an old-fashioned form of government, one that says to the people: ‘Just go to sleep; we will make sure everything is alright’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, in a Europe of 27 Member States, or perhaps of 26 Member States plus one, it is absolutely crucial that we are able to weigh up which country or group is in favour of which interest. Mistakes can be made more easily behind a closed door than behind an open one. We should therefore give Europeans access to decision making. A closed door also leads to more euroscepticism. How at present do you know for sure that your minister has done the best for you? He can tell you so at home, but you are unable to check it. And this is what this European Parliament must stand for.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I find it naïve that the Commission, the Council and also the Christian Democrats should simply be saying ‘no, it would just be bothersome and we do not want to bother European citizens with all this; it will only waste time, and we would have to have the lobbyists at the table with us’. The lobbyists are already sitting at the table, and I would like to know which lobbyists sit on which table and who is influenced by them. That is why the European Parliament and the people are calling for openness.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the draft regulation we are discussing has a chance of improving the transparency of the European institutions’ functioning in the eyes of the public. If the principle of transparency also covers the bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, then, by analysing their work through easier access to published documents, the citizens themselves might reach the conclusion that, in some cases, the expansion of the EU’s bureaucracy represents an excess of form over content and that its maintenance is not always necessary, especially in times of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In this context, it also does not seem correct to me that if new posts are created for officials, it is for information officials. Efforts to ensure that any natural or legal person in the European Union has access to full and exhaustive information should be a right and a task for all employees according to their area of competence. At the same time, with a view to increasing transparency in the technocratic application and making of law, a positive requirement of the draft regulation is the widening of citizens’ access to also include documents implementing delegated acts. Information on security aspects should be afforded special protection.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, let us not fool ourselves. For us MEPs, Brussels may be the centre of our work, but Brussels is a long way away for the average citizen. A recent survey also indicates that, throughout Europe, citizens have less and less confidence in European policy. More than half of them consider that poverty in Europe has risen thanks to Brussels.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The traditional reaction is then to explain to the citizen one more time. The information budget of the European institutions is enormous, but all this sending out of information does not work. Today’s citizen is no longer a passive recipient. He wants to be heard and that his voice should count. He decides for himself what he wants to know.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In his proposal, the rapporteur opted for a strong approach which gives citizens a greater – and not, as the Commission wants, a lesser – right to information. I am grateful to him for having taken my proposals on board to make documents concerning Council negotiations not automatically inaccessible to the public. It is precisely in the negotiation phase that the citizens want their voice to be heard and we should not deprive them of that opportunity.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There will be difficult negotiations with the Commission and the Council, and this is why the rapporteur needs the support of the entire Parliament.

      <p sl="nl">The question thus arises of how it can possibly be that the openness we desire was not part of the Treaty of Lisbon from the very outset. Can it be that the reason is the European project is an elite game that cannot tolerate openness? Can it be that it would immediately fail if the citizens were to know what is going on here? Whatever the case, Dutch citizens pay as much as EUR 5.7 billion annually to be members of the Union. They at least want to know what we get up to with their money.</p>

The citizens are turning away from a Union which threatens their wellbeing and does not want to hear their voice.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The United Kingdom has now rightly opted for its national interest, the interest of its citizens. The interest of the citizens should, after all, be the starting point for every Head of Government and for the European Union as a whole.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, to put things into perspective, the first thing we should say is that the EU institutions are already amongst the most transparent institutions in the entire European Union. The EPP Group is committed to transparency and we have shown this recently in a vote we took in favour of the Hautala-Sargentini report on public access to documents. But unfortunately, the report we are debating is a case of a good thing taken too far. Instead of increasing transparency, it risks undermining the work of the institutions and therefore it does not serve the interests of our citizens. Let me explain why.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to this report, the minutes of the negotiating meetings we hold when we make laws with the Council and the Commission – trialogue meetings – would have to be made public. Now, if we do this, none of the negotiating parties involved will want to adopt a flexible approach for fear that what they say will be reported in public and will weaken their negotiating position. How will this benefit citizens, may I ask? It would make weaker laws, not better laws, because those involved would not take a flexible approach out of fear that what they say will be publicly reported in the name of transparency. They would not be allowed the space to think, the space to present different negotiating options and the space to adopt constructive positions.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, despite its good intentions, this report will not lead to further transparency. It will just undermine the institutions’ work in favour of citizens. It turns a good idea into a bad one. That is why the EPP Group will vote against this and continue to work constructively in favour of more transparency that makes sense.</p>

      <p sl="en">Blue-card answer. – Madam President, first of all, Ms Sommer says that lobbyists should not have influence on the procedure, but what are lobbyists? A human rights organisation or an environment organisation – are they not lobbyists acting on behalf of the citizens? Or lobbyists may be representing interests of patient organisations, for example.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I still do not understand her point. We are arguing for more transparency in order to make the current lobbying, including industries, visible where now it is taking place behind closed doors. They are influencing policy making today, which is not a bad thing, but it should be visible.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, only a few decades ago, the philosophy in large parts of Europe was that individuals did not count, the state was everything. Citizens were nothing other than subjects of the state institutions with no rights. What we have been continually working for here – and in this regard, access to documents is only one aspect among many – is to turn this relationship between citizen and state on its head and to place it on a new foundation. Access to information and transparency are essential prerequisites for democracy. Citizens cannot exercise their civil rights, have an influence on policy making or express their opinion without having sufficient access to information. That also means that the institutions need to understand that they are not superior to citizens, but rather they are there to serve them.</p>
      <p sl="de">In this regard, I would like to add – and this is directed at Vice-President Šefčovič and others who have said this – we do not need to make every cough transparent. There are also procedures where confidentiality is justified. However, we cannot simply claim that confidentiality is justified in a particular case. We cannot just classify something as ‘confidential’; there needs to be a proper procedure for this. Where there is disagreement and doubts exist, it must be possible for this to be decided by the court. That is fitting for a modern, democratic society and an approach that follows the rule of law.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are seeing an increasing tendency for the interests of lobbyists and businesses to have a direct influence on political decisions. We will only be able to restore confidence if the citizens know that they have extensive access to documents.</p>
      <p sl="de">While we are regulating this here, we can see that more and more institutions are being created outside the Treaties. What this Parliament and the Commission should focus on is placing what is currently happening in unlegislated areas firmly within Community law and making what we are debating here applicable to all institutions.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the EU’s decisions should be taken in an open and citizen-centred way. The review of the legal framework relating to access to the documents of EU institutions was a litmus test for the European transparency initiative. The amendments relating to the definitions set out and the exceptions laid down in the legislative text should be supported.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would also like to address the question of guaranteeing access to documents. We must do this by also ensuring that the documents are easy to find. We are all aware of the enormous amount of information and large numbers of documents that we produce on a daily basis. Even we almost despair when we are searching for a particular document. It is the same for our citizens. Therefore, we must make the information available to citizens in a simple and transparent way.</p>

However, as I am none of those things, I will vote with full conviction against this report.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are all in favour of transparency in political decision-making processes. We are all in favour of better access to documents for citizens. However, in his report, and with your support, Mr Cashman goes much too far. Look at the definition of ‘document’, where he states that anything connected in any way with the policies, measures or decisions of all bodies and other institutions of the EU must be included. That means that, if Mr Cashman’s proposals are adopted, all debates that we hold anywhere during the course of our decision-making processes within our groups or delegations will also be included. If we make strategic preparations in order to protect the interests of Parliament, for example, in relation to the Council, these will also be included. The content of informal trialogues, also in the interests of the European Parliament, or strategic planning discussions in Europol or Frontex, will also have to be included if you and Mr Cashman have your way.</p>
      <p sl="de">It means that anyone who supports this report will make successful policy-related parliamentary work impossible, reduce the effectiveness of the European Parliament and help criminal organisations to carry out their work. Anyone who votes for this report will not be increasing transparency for citizens. Voting for this report will instead support political naivety and, in some areas, also the abuse of European laws.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, I was very pleased by your statement, and you will certainly have the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). You Mr Cashman, on the other hand, will most definitely not.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, I would firstly like to thank our colleague, Michael Cashman, because he really has carried out a considerable amount of work and I wish him success in fighting to give European Union citizens full access to documents. Indeed, my question is why the Commission’s proposal did not include provisions on additional applications for information, the implementation of the principle of good and open administration in the transitional period, provisions banning any kind of discrimination, as well as provisions prohibiting refusals to give citizens information on grounds of possible technical issues or perhaps other discrepancies? My question is therefore what are we trying to protect ourselves against and what are we trying to protect? After all, what are we afraid of? Are we afraid of our citizens who elected us and in whose name we have to work? The Charter of Fundamental Rights, which entered into force along with the Lisbon Treaty, clearly provides that European Union citizens have a right of access to EU institution documentation, whatever its medium. Our task as representatives of the citizens is therefore to ensure that this right is implemented properly and transparently.</p>

      <p sl="da">Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent report. Please try to remember that, despite everything – and this is something that I want to say to Mr Šefčovič – it is we here in Parliament who represent the people. We are the ones who know that if the people do not gain more confidence in our system, we will lose the fight for the EU and the EU’s credibility and influence. We are, in fact, at a very critical juncture at the moment, and it is therefore disheartening to hear the Commission and individual Members here speaking as if what was important was the security of officials and politicians. It was as if it was them – and ourselves – that we should safeguard rather than our citizens. It is the confidence of our citizens we are dealing with here.</p>
      <p sl="da">There are exceptions. I have worked with disclosure for very many years, including in the Danish Parliament. Of course there are exceptions. It is always a struggle to define these exceptions so that they do not become excessive. It is not something that is simply a foregone conclusion in itself – there is always a fight to ensure openness and security. The security that we are to provide for officials comes from the fact that they are within a system in which there is mutual trust. There is plenty of room for error without anyone being killed as a result. However, there is no room for error when it comes to providing transparency for citizens. I therefore very much hope that action will be taken in the Commission and, for that matter, in the Council, too.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, 12 new Member States joined the European Union recently, making huge sacrifices while they were joining the EU. The 15 old Member States also made huge sacrifices as part of European integration. All this was done with the idea of creating greater solidarity, of how the people who were to the east of the Iron Curtain would receive huge benefits.</p>
      <p sl="bg">However, I can tell you that ordinary citizens in my country, Bulgaria, are finding it difficult to exercise their rights in the European Union. The reason is that they cannot find out from anywhere how to do it. The current situation is creating a Euro-oligarchy where only those with internal access to this information can exercise their rights. This is wrong and must be stopped.</p>
      <p sl="bg">This is why these amendments tabled before us now (which are not from Mr Cashman, but are the result of many years of work by four parliamentary committees) are better than the proposal from the Commission, and I urge you to support them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, transparency is vital for the link between Europe’s citizens and its institutions. It helps reinforce the EU’s legitimacy. In fact, the Treaty guarantees the right of public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, but a suitable legislative framework is required to exercise it.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), of which I am a member, supports greater transparency, it cannot support Mr Cashman’s report in its current form. Some proposals not only exceed the provisions of the Treaty, but also the interinstitutional agreements in force. If unlimited public access has to be given to all the documents and information from Europe’s institutions, this may have a considerable adverse effect. In the case of ongoing legislative procedures, the negotiations very often required to reach an agreement will be affected.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Transparency is important, but must not be applied to the detriment of security and the respect for privacy. I think that personal data, commercial secrets and classified or sensitive information are not given sufficient protection under the form proposed. In addition, it is likely to be extremely difficult to implement this in practical terms, given the huge number of documents involved.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European institutions’ administrative practices need to be open to greater public scrutiny and such scrutiny will undoubtedly improve citizens’ confidence in their European public bodies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Commissioner, in my own country, the Freedom of Information Act 1997 has revolutionised the ways decisions are made by public bodies and by public officials. If a decision maker believes that his or her determination may be the subject of a freedom of information request, he or she will be much more diligent in ensuring that proper procedure is followed. This is what legal scholars term the virtuous cycle of public administration.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, notwithstanding all of this, the fees incurred by individuals under the current freedom of information system in Ireland acts as a barrier to full access to public information. These fees can be up to EUR 150 per request, and EUR 20 per hour if the document has to be searched for and retrieved. So, whatever system is decided upon, I would encourage my colleagues to take cognisance of the problems in the Irish context concerning fees when deciding on practical issues in this proposal. I welcome the fact that this legislation is intended to cover not only Parliament, Commission and Council but all EU public bodies, excepting the derogations in relation to the banks.

      <p sl="en">Every European citizen has the right to access EU documents and this right should be respected.

These guidelines must be clear, accessible, predictable and easy to understand and implement.</p>

I take this opportunity to again request the Commission to ensure real transparency concerning the beneficiaries of the EU funds in the Member States, on its website, in one of the three working languages, and on the basis of common criteria.

      <p sl="sv">Madam President, it is 10 years since the EU got its first transparency regulation. Now, when citizens’ trust in the EU and politics is badly damaged, it is more important than ever that we open up as much as possible. Mr Cashman’s proposal is a good one. It contains a number of important improvements, for example, that every document must be evaluated individually and not in batches, that transparency should be the general rule and secrecy the exception, and that protection of personal data must never be used as an excuse to refuse access to documents.</p>
      <p sl="sv">However, I do see a problem with the classification contained in the proposal. This could be used as a surreptitious way of over-classifying documents. Consequently, I would like to go further than most of the other speakers. This is because we have come so far when it comes to transparency in a number of Member States. In my country, transparency works extremely well and it strengthens democracy. I have one question for those of you who do not want to go a single step along this road. What are you frightened of?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in times when there is sometimes the feeling that Europe is complex and far away, it is even more important for us to give a clear commitment on transparency and openness. The message we send to the people of Europe is that we have nothing to hide that concerns them and their lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">In fact, we encourage them to be involved in what we are doing. We want them not only to follow but also to participate in what we are doing; not only to accept the final result of our deliberations but also, prior to that, to take part in the decision making. On our draft proposals, they can influence us by their views. We encourage public debate on our work. We really care that they get a picture and that they have a chance to understand, if they so wish, what is going on in the Strasbourg and Brussels buildings. They decide what is relevant for them. They pick and choose. Most importantly, they have the right to check and to hold us accountable for what we do and say when we represent them on their behalf.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bridging the democratic gap with our citizens has to be done in a responsible way. Privacy, personal data, personal integrity should not be put at risk by disclosing informal information. In Sweden, we have a strong tradition of access to documents, but it is also normal to have some information that is classified. A climate of confidence is necessary to achieve complex negotiation like trialogues. Widely displaying pieces of information is not openness. Openness does not mean WikiLeaks.</p>

I see the approach taken by the Commission as an effort to achieve the desired changes more quickly. I agree with the comments formulated in the minority opinion under Article 52 paragraph 3 of the Rules of Procedure, as some of the amendments proposed in Mr Cashman’s report go somewhat beyond the necessary framework of information publication in achieving the necessary level of public control. I firmly believe that the good intentions of the Commission to expand public access to EU documents must be developed in a qualified way, and that we should not continue with counter-productive disputes over the publication of discrete information, which, for various reasons, is really not suitable for dissemination.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, freedom of information was one of those universally popular objectives, or at least I thought so until this afternoon, although few contemplate the justified exceptions and even fewer choose to exercise this right. Possibly one reason might be lethargy or lack of interest, but another might be ignorance that there is anything to look for. I think it was Donald Rumsfeld who distinguished between what we know we don’t know and what we don’t know we don’t know. In the case of the former, we can employ our knowledge to seek the unknown, but in the latter case we cannot seek a document the existence of which we are entirely ignorant.</p>
      <p sl="en">Perhaps there should be a publicly accessible register of documents, or some proactive attempt to make sure that lobbyists know of them. There is also the problem that discussions which are very sensitive, but not classified or legally restricted information, might take place without a paper or electronic record or that discussions by e-mail might be routinely deleted.

Something will need to be done.</p>

I do sound a note of caution though on what I hear from the Commission, which is that they have no intention of being transparent, nor does the EPP when they are talking about undermining institutions and about a legitimate report.

This is the so-called Maternity Leave Directive. The European Parliament amended the text of the directive so much that, after almost three years, it is almost impossible to find a consensus between the institutions, and that is to the disadvantage of EU citizens. Looking at signals from the European Commission and the Council, I am convinced that this text will meet a similar fate. If we strip people naked in airports because we suspect that they have explosives under their dresses or trousers, they will stop using aircraft.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for a very lively debate, which clearly demonstrates the importance of ensuring clear rules for citizens’ access to EU documents. This is the objective of the regulation and I am very glad that it was underlined by several speakers, starting with Ms Sommer.</p>
      <p sl="en">The discussion was wide-ranging. Of course, I will not be able to respond to all the comments or all the points raised, so allow me to take this opportunity to set the record straight on some of the critical remarks on the Commission’s proposal.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, I would like to give Ms Monika Flašíková Beňová and Ms Jäätteenmäki assurance as to the definition of ‘documents’. The proposed regulation would not lead to fewer documents being disclosed than is the case today; a more precise definition of ‘documents’ means safer administration and more clarity for the citizens. As I have already stated, many requests for competition files running to thousands of pages are made by lawyers of the companies concerned for reasons that have nothing to do with the aim of transparency. These requests do not lead to the public disclosure of documents, but create a huge administrative burden and search. These requests are made in order to create a competitive advantage over competitors or to circumvent investigation. This burden is very great in the files related to the protection of the single market.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, we believe that our proposed definition mainly clarifies the situation. On the exceptions relating to the legislative process: I believe – as do many speakers in the House – that to have a limited space to think is necessary, as was pointed out by several speakers, Mr Pirker, Mr Busuttil and others.</p>
      <p sl="en">Here in the European Parliament, several of you reflected on what consequences the proposed amendments by Mr Cashman would have on the proceedings of the Conference of Presidents or ongoing trialogues, for example. I believe that you will agree that internal discussions must be frank, which requires a certain degree of confidentiality as regards the opinions expressed. This confidentiality must be balanced against the public interest of transparency on a case-by-case basis, as was pointed out by Mr Alfano.</p>
      <p sl="en">A few words on the next steps. As I have stated, the Commission is looking forward to discussions with the colegislators and will participate actively with a view to reaching a balanced compromise. In light of the progress of these discussions, the Commission will decide on further steps and will do its utmost to contribute to finding common ground between the colegislators.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, the Commission will continue to work proactively on increasing transparency. I cannot accept some of the claims that the Commission is against transparency; that we are trying to get a rollback on transparency. That is definitely not true. We are very much continuing with our transparency initiative. I truly believe that the EU institutions and the Commission are among the most transparent in the world. They would stand comparison in this respect to any Member State in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Take the transparency register for example. We have already more than 4 600 companies registered and more that 22 000 people covered. I would very much welcome the support of the European Parliament in being even more proactive in raising awareness of the transparency register. Help us to get more law firms registered in the transparency register so that they send us fewer letters asking for documents which the Commission has to study very carefully if they are not related to ongoing investigations. They should be enrolled in the register. Why are they refusing? Help us there and I think we will do a greater service to transparency in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">Next year, thanks to the great assistance and help from this Parliament, we will start with the European Citizens’ Initiative. I think that this will be another test for all of the EU institutions: how we can react, how we can communicate and how we can exchange views and reconnect with European citizens. I think this will be further proof of how the European Commission and how the EU institutions communicate with citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to thank all the honourable Members for their active discussion on this file. I am open for constructive cooperation and I believe that, if we really focus on the balanced approach, we can achieve this goal.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I look forward to negotiating with the Commission. That will be a first, so let us meet soon.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would just like to address some of the points. We actually enshrine the concept of a space to think; we do not diminish it. We actually enshrine the concept of classified documents, Mr Pirker, so it is absolutely clear that documents that are restricted, classified or confidential cannot be made public. Equally, we deal with the issue of documents coming from Member States. Member States would like to have a veto so that they cannot be placed in the public domain, whereas there are cases where they should be, such as documents in competition law proceedings and for businesses. I believe that if Articles 4(2) and 4(7) of the current regulation are used appropriately, then there are sufficient guarantees for competition cases and for businesses.</p>
      <p sl="en">This approach is not about unrestricted access. We have to be clear about definitions, clear when documents cannot be made accessible, and equally clear when they can. We must reflect the jurisprudence that has been handed down, and we must balance data protection and privacy.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me say that it is entirely wrong to say that privacy and personnel maters will not be respected. They are absolutely respected and the data protection supervisor says that in our report, we have got the balance absolutely right. I would remind you that there is also a directive on data protection which cannot be overridden here. There is also the Members’ Statute about political meetings, about the conduct of MEPs and about personnel which cannot be overridden within this regulation.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is either mischief or it is ignorance that causes people to propose such suggestions. Can we please stop treating our citizens, and indeed the NGOs that represent them, as children? They want to be engaged in the political process, and if they do not know what we are doing in their name, and what the Commission and the Council is doing, how on earth can we call ourselves ‘democratic’? Democracy is based on openness and accountability and, if we can only negotiate in secret, where is the democracy in that?</p>
      <p sl="en">We negotiate on the basis of principle and on what we wish to actually defend for our citizens and indeed our political parties. If we can only do that in secrecy, I am not one of those politicians and I do not belong to one of those political parties that concur.</p>
      <p sl="en">You can criticise this but, Ms Sommer, I have begged you time and time again to work with me and to bring forward compromises, but comprises came there none. Where there are problems, I am happy to address them on behalf of the entire Parliament because the brilliant thing is that whether this gets voted through or not tomorrow is neither here nor there. Whether the Commission accepts this is irrelevant. Whether the Council negotiates on this is irrelevant, because what you cannot do, which is what the Commission and indeed the Council are trying to do, is to diminish the rights they gave to citizens in 2001. So even if we reject the entire proposal, the rights that were enshrined in 2001 under the Swedish Presidency will remain.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think I have covered most of the points. Can I say that inflexibility in democracy is actually a weakness. Flexibility is a strength, and we show that in our committees when we negotiate with one another and we reach compromises. Thank you, Ms Macovei, thank you, Ms Bildt, for your constructive comments. I would say to Nikki Sinclaire that the Labour government actually supported these measures in 2001 in Council and the Labour government continued to do so while it was in office. If we are pro-European, let us actually get rid of the secrecy because then it is much more difficult to misrepresent the truth.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Madam President, I would like to clarify one point. The rapporteur said, in effect, that, as negotiator for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I refused to accept compromises. That is not true. We shadow rapporteurs had a great many meetings, but the rapporteur’s proposals for compromise put to me as representative of my group were such that I essentially only had the option of supporting his opinion. The rapporteur refused to accept any of the proposals for compromises put forward by the PPE Group and, in the end, he explicitly shut us out, even with regard to very trivial matters. That is the truth that also needs to be said.</p>
      <p sl="de">Secondly, the rapporteur just said ‘there is a directive on data protection which cannot be overridden here’. Well, if you read the text of your report, recital 18 states: ‘Due to the fact that this regulation directly implements Article 15 TFEU as well as Article 42 of the Charter, the defined principles and limits for access to documents should prevail over any rules, measures or practices adopted under a different legal basis by an institution, body, office or agency and introducing additional or stricter exceptions than the ones provided in this regulation’. So, let us also have a little bit of truth here.</p>

      <p sl="cs">The long-running process to increase openness within public administrations goes back to 1998, when the so-called Aarhus Convention was signed. The submitted report on the regulation strives to minimise the documents to which the public has no right, introducing the greatest possible level of information and openness to decision-making processes. The basic principle of the regulation is the so-called principle of active openness, which entails the active publication of all documents created by EU bodies. The amendment to the regulation introduces the obligation for every administrative unit to appoint one employee responsible for providing information at the request of citizens. An obligation is also introduced for the active publication of documents and also for the new implementation of a common interface linking the document registers of individual EU bodies. This measure should make it possible to link up individual registers, thereby increasing citizens’ access to documents. The obligation to make available all information on decision-making processes is also newly introduced in respect of each stage of decision making. I would like to end by emphasising that, in the spirit of the Aarhus Convention, all information shall be provided free of charge, thereby avoiding the creation of further barriers to greater openness and awareness.</p>

      <p sl="it">The Cashman report on public access to documents of the European institutions takes into account a fundamental value enshrined in the Treaty, which is that of transparency. The conditions laid down for the implementation of this right can be found in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which is to be amended by this legislative procedure. In its proposal, the Commission assumes an ‘open’ position, which I think the rapporteur wishes to extend far beyond the goal of transparency, placing at risk the protection of personal and sensitive data. Mr Cashman also defines as a ‘document’ any information or content which in some way relates to the policies, measures and decisions of any EU institution, also including preparatory, confidential and informal documents, that is to say, any piece of information. The ‘space to think’ is thus reduced to a minimum. I believe that the value of transparency and the democratic participation of citizens in the life of the institutions is of fundamental importance but this should be reconciled with other fundamental values, such as the protection of personal and sensitive data, and should concern official documents, but not ‘the procedure …</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Knut Fleckenstein, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (COM (2010) 0611 - C7-0343/2010 - 2010/0303 (COD)) (A7-0372/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="3-375-000" speaker_id="96840" name="Knut Fleckenstein" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by offering my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their very open, excellent collaboration. It was not too difficult in this case, as we are all convinced of the good and very efficient work that the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) has done in the last few years. There quickly emerged a relatively homogeneous picture of what we envisage the future work of this agency to be. We also all agreed that any kind of extension of competences must either have European added value or generate clear synergy effects in the Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">Allow me to mention just a few aspects. On 20 April 2010, we experienced the worst oil disaster in human history in the Gulf of Mexico. On 10 August 2011, there was the oil spill at the Gannet Alpha platform in the North Sea. The report on oil pollution by the Oslo-Paris Commission reveals that, in 2008, there were more than 500 oil spills at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. It was therefore right for the Directorate-General for Energy to table a legislative package in this regard to improve the regulation of oil platforms. This includes an independent third party who is to monitor the safety of the oil platforms. Together, we should open the door for EMSA here. What European body could perform this supervisory role better?</p>
      <p sl="de">I know that EMSA does not currently have the relevant expertise. However, that is a weak argument. There are large overlaps with the areas in which EMSA currently works, and it is considerably more efficient these days to extend the available resources rather than to create entirely new ones.</p>
      <p sl="de">If the Member States now say that they are prepared to extend EMSA’s mandate and state that EMSA is now not only responsible for shipping accidents, but is also to perform the clear up following oil spills caused by drilling rigs, this will perhaps reveal a modicum of common sense, but it will certainly not be a major breakthrough. The European Parliament must focus on preventive measures. Merely cleaning up after the event is not enough. Commissioner Oettinger said that numerous facts about accidents confirm that prevention is better than trying to put things right afterwards. This statement is perhaps not particularly helpful, but it is right nevertheless.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to address two more points that also seem to me to be important. We need European maritime transport without borders. We have already had many debates on this subject, but there is still too little being done and too slowly for us to achieve this objective. With the help of EMSA and its recording capabilities, we can also make progress in this area.</p>
      <p sl="de">My next point is that we all know how important it is to support maritime occupations in the European Union. We cannot and do not under any circumstances want to win the competition for the lowest personnel costs and the reduction of social standards. However, when it comes to the quality of the training and further training of the seafarers, then we can play a leading role, and EMSA can and must contribute its knowledge and expertise in this regard.</p>
      <p sl="de">In committee, the report received the support of a large majority. It is intended to make it clear that Parliament takes its proposals seriously. I am confident as regards the negotiations with the Council. However, this presupposes a serious readiness to negotiate. That is what I am asking for.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein, and the shadow rapporteurs for their work regarding the preparation of the Parliament’s position on our proposal to reinforce the European Maritime Safety Agency. In general, the Commission is very grateful for the continuous support by the Parliament to EMSA.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Parliament and Council adopted the EMSA Founding Regulation in June 2002. Over the years, EMSA has evolved into an operational agency supporting both the Commission and the Member States. EMSA is highly respected by its stakeholders for its professionalism and quality output.</p>
      <p sl="en">EMSA’s core business will remain maritime safety. EMSA also contributes to maritime security and to environmental aspects of shipping. The most operational forms are the network of pollution response vessels, the satellite tracking of illegal discharges by ships and the different systems to monitor maritime traffic.</p>
      <p sl="en">EMSA’s technical expertise is interesting for other policy areas. Therefore, the Commission has made a proposal to extend EMSA’s mandate with regard to certain aspects for which we feel more EU added value is possible. The rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism have expressed their support for this approach and have indicated three priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">The first priority is establishing the European Maritime Space without barriers. I fully share this objective. We have an internal market. A truck goes from Tallinn to Lisbon without any barriers. A vessel, however, is considered to be on an international voyage and is required to fulfil the same formalities as if she were coming from Asia or America. EMSA is able to assist us in realising the European Maritime Space without barriers. The Blue Belt project is an important milestone. It aims at enhancing Short Sea Shipping in the EU by monitoring and recording the route of each individual vessel and thus supporting customs requirements.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second priority is promoting maritime professions in the EU. Again, I fully share this objective and I am committed to developing a social maritime agenda. I see a role for EMSA supporting us in reaching this objective. Not only does EMSA know a lot about training and qualification systems in Member States and third countries, but EMSA has already developed an information system. However, EMSA itself should neither become a maritime academy nor deliver certificates to seafarers.</p>
      <p sl="en">The third priority is improving the safety of offshore installations in the EU. In the wake of the tragic accident involving the Deepwater Horizon offshore installation in the Gulf of Mexico, like many Member States, the EU, through EMSA, provided specialised equipment to the United States. Some weeks ago, the Commission, at the initiative of my colleague, Mr Oettinger, presented a legislative proposal to enhance the safety of offshore installations in the EU. The Commission’s objective is to establish high safety standards across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">The proposal we are discussing today already foresees that EMSA’s pollution response capabilities ought to be made available in case of pollution caused by offshore installations. I know that the Parliament wants to go further in a couple of amendments giving EMSA a role in the prevention of pollution by offshore installations, in the licensing process and in third-party oversight. However, EMSA has no expertise in drilling and well operations. Therefore, the Commission would like EMSA to remain a maritime transport agency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following your planned vote, I would consider that it should not be difficult for Parliament and the Council to reach an agreement on the current EMSA proposal. There are areas in which it is more efficient to improve coordination and cooperation through EMSA. Conversely, the EU – including EMSA – will, and should, stay out of areas which are better served by national, regional or local authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, I am grateful for the support of Parliament, and I am looking forward to reaching an agreement soon on EMSA’s new mandate.</p>

    <intervention id="3-377-000" speaker_id="4751" name="Bart Staes" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety">
      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it all has to do with the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico; indeed, the Committee on the Environment used that disaster and crisis last November to force the Commission to come up with a complete overview of the measures which need to be taken. These measures range from better monitoring of oil drilling installations to new legislation on environmental liability.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In that sense, the proposal on the revision of the regulation on the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) has come at a particularly opportune moment. I think that we in the Committee on the Environment – the rapporteur has taken on board very many matters that we raised, and I thank him for that – and the European Parliament have adopted a very good position.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I believe we are asking for a number of very specific things: on the one hand, that EMSA should offer cost-efficient measures for eliminating oil pollution, including from oil drilling installations, and that CleanSeaNet and satellite navigation should be put to better use. Nothing comes for free, and we therefore all know that if we give EMSA new responsibilities, we will probably also have to increase its budget slightly in order to pay for them.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think that this all comes to the fore in Mr Fleckenstein’s report, and I also hope that the negotiations between Parliament and the Council will come to a positive conclusion and that, together with the Commissioner, we will be able to ensure that combating oil spills at sea is improved, not only as far as ships are concerned, but also with regard to oil drilling installations.</p>

    <intervention id="3-378-000" speaker_id="28393" name="Luis de Grandes Pascual" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="on behalf of the PPE Group">
      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to begin by saying that if this issue has seemed easy, if it is reaching a successful conclusion, it is due in great part to the dedicated, rigorous and flexible position of the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein. I would like to thank him, on behalf of my group, for being flexible enough to accept our points of view and getting us to the point where we almost have a consensus.</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the European Maritime Safety Agency is a success story. Day after day, it justifies its existence and the reason for its existence. The amendment to the regulation establishing EMSA does not seek to rectify errors; on the contrary, it aims to extend the agency’s competences in the light of new challenges and the emergence of new problems, and we believe that EMSA is the appropriate instrument for tackling and resolving those problems.</p>
      <p sl="es">Parliament wants to make sure that EMSA does not turn into a body with a life of its own, but continues to be guided by the Commission and continues to intervene at the request of the Commission itself or the Member States. The serious accident in the Gulf of Mexico has shown us that EMSA should be entrusted with helping the states to investigate accidents involving maritime, coastal or offshore installations.</p>
      <p sl="es">On a separate note, it is important to emphasise EMSA’s role in supporting the monitoring of the organisations recognised as classification societies, particularly as regards ensuring mutual recognition.</p>
      <p sl="es">It should be noted that the agency plays a key role in Port State Control and the fight against piracy. For the first time, the report makes explicit reference to the agency’s work involving the satellite-based monitoring of fishing vessels and ships fishing in dangerous waters, for example, through its close collaboration with Operation Atalanta. It is vital to comply with the environmental strategy and support EMSA assistance when necessary.</p>
      <p sl="es">As regards the composition of the Administrative Board, I believe that there should be a gender balance and that this should be stated in a recital. I think that it would be excessive to introduce it in an article. I also believe that it would be feasible to promote maritime training and exchanges of good practices among institutions and schools. We will not support the European network of training academies as each Member State has its own special characteristics and needs.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, Madam President, regretfully we have to vote against Amendments 18 and 41 because the aim is to exclude the word ‘national’. That is something that is neither ingenuous nor innocent. No one and no state, especially in these times when we are giving up sovereignty in return for economic efficiency, is prepared to accept that the word ‘national’, the existence of the states, should not be compatible, as indeed it should, with the existence of the Union of 27, soon to be 28.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fleckenstein, for an excellent report and for the way in which he has managed to assemble a broad majority in favour of his points of view. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) is one of the agencies that is not so well known to the public, but which does outstanding work, primarily in the area of maritime safety and in limiting maritime pollution, including oil pollution from seafaring vessels.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The time has now come to introduce new steps in the Community’s management of European waters. The aim must be to arrive at a European area for maritime transport, namely, by significantly reducing administrative formalities for intra-Community traffic, and the agency can, of course, play an important role in achieving that, including on the basis of the Blue Belt pilot project.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, additional tasks should also be entrusted to the agency in the area of safety – a matter that has already been referred to several times – such as monitoring of pollution management by oil installations. The experience of Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico reveals the enormous extent of the potential negative effects of such pollution. EMSA should not only be responsible for incident resolution, but should also play a crucial role with regard to prevention and coordination. I think we have to convince the Member States, and apparently the Commission too, about that.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I am not saying that everything should be dealt with by EMSA alone, but I think we should also carefully examine how things might be coordinated better in the area of prevention. There is no need for us to reinvent the wheel. An agency already exists. Let us allow that agency to assume those tasks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Reference has also been made to the importance of agreements with third countries. There, too, a role must be reserved for the agency. Finally, I wish to deal with two other matters. Firstly, we need to make jobs in the maritime shipping sector more attractive. This is genuinely a big challenge. The social aspect is something that has to be worked out. Then there is the need to combat piracy, a matter which my colleague has already raised. EMSA can play a role in that area, too, by organising the exchange of data and by informing security agencies of the position of our ships.</p>
      <p sl="nl">For all these reasons, ladies and gentlemen, we fully support the report by Mr Fleckenstein and wish him much success in the negotiations with the Council.</p>

      <p sl="es">Madam President, Commissioner, it is true that the headlines about European integration are being overtaken by the agreements reached at the weekend summit. However, it is also true that Europe is built on reports such as the one we are approving today on the European Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
      <p sl="es">EMSA was born of the crises generated by the Erika and Prestige disasters. It is a response to problems of European significance, such as the environmental disasters caused by these types of maritime accidents and the risks they pose to people’s lives and wellbeing.</p>
      <p sl="es">The agency, with its extended competences, will now help to coordinate and integrate the efforts and resources at European and national level, thereby allowing more efficient use of the available resources, and preventing duplication and dysfunctions. That is the first step in combating the deficit.</p>
      <p sl="es">I am sorry that the opposition of the large groups has prevented the regional perspective from being included, too, as resources are also employed at that level to prevent and respond to these types of incidents, as we saw during the Prestige disaster, when the Basque fishing fleet, for example, cleaned up hundreds of tonnes of oil.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Committee on Transport and Tourism decided that the agency’s competences should, in future, extend to any incidents involving oil or gas platforms, but we have heard the Commissioner’s position on that.</p>
      <p sl="es">Finally, the report ensures that resources such as satellite-based vessel monitoring can also be used for the agency’s own purposes, for safety and maritime traffic operations and, specifically, in the fight against piracy.</p>
      <p sl="es">Unfortunately, it does not incorporate the amendments aimed at introducing gender balance criteria for the composition of the agency’s governing bodies, thereby contradicting the declarations of this Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="es">The new EMSA encompasses strong support for better training for professionals working in this sector, although the idea of setting up a European school of excellence or a network to harmonise training at European level was rejected. The report also favours the systematic application of innovation in the sector.</p>
      <p sl="es">For all of these reasons, I believe that we should congratulate Mr Fleckenstein and express our thanks for the support for this initiative. EMSA builds Europe, too, because it demonstrates that the actions of its institutions benefit the citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">There was much to agree on and little to dispute, and that was because we believe that EMSA is doing a very good job. I was particularly pleased to see three elements in this report. The first was an increased role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in the monitoring of offshore oil and gas installations; the second, increased preparedness to provide a response to maritime accidents; and the third, an increase in partnership working to deliver maritime surveillance, including the SafeSeaNet programme, hopefully linking up with some of the policies recently approved in our integrated maritime policy.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, I first wish to thank Mr Fleckenstein for his work and pleasant cooperation and I would also like to thank the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) itself. I think that EMSA is one of the better European agencies. EMSA is able, using satellite systems, to detect oil spillages, and its satellite data can also be used to combat piracy. These are all aspects which are good for security at sea.</p>
      <p sl="nl">However, Madam President, I believe that Europe is going too far in reviewing this EMSA mandate. In the proposals, EMSA is given more tasks and powers than is necessary. Look, for example, at the tasks EMSA is acquiring to promote the internal market at sea or to go busying itself with inland waterways. These are tasks which I say should remain outside of EMSA.</p>
      <p sl="nl">They are already performed perfectly well by a number of national and international organisations. EMSA does not need to duplicate or take over that work. This also applies to the inspection of oil and gas drilling platforms. I do not think it is necessary for EMSA to do that. Those platforms are already monitored from European countries and I am personally very familiar with the monitoring that takes place. I have worked closely with the inspection service and I know that the monitoring of gas and oil platforms generally works well.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Fleckenstein report also opens the door to a European coastguard service. Madam President, my group is not holding its breath, not only because that work is already being done in an excellent manner by the national coastguards, but also because – as many people forget – the national coastguards already cooperate very well with each other. They also work efficiently, and this further step need not, as far as my group is concerned, be put into effect.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In brief, we must sometimes say that enough is enough. In this Parliament, we constantly want more tasks and more powers. This is now going a step too far for us Despite the rapporteur’s good work, we are unfortunately unable to support this report.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The agency should act in the interest of the Union. This also includes the fact that the agency may act outside the territory of the EU in its areas of competence, applying the European Union’s maritime safety policy on the basis of scientific and technical cooperation with third countries. The tasks of the enlarged agency must be described clearly and precisely in order to avoid duplication and any confusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Fleckenstein, I would like to express my sincere thanks for your excellent coordination. Coordination is always very important, particularly when it concerns the European Maritime Safety Agency. People are very quick to criticise these agencies. We heard that a moment ago from Mr van Dalen. However, I believe that we really should say thank you in this regard, including to the staff of EMSA. They have done an excellent job.</p>
      <p sl="de">We heard very clearly once again this morning in the debate on security and defence policy what potential we have in Europe if we work together in a sensible way. That is something that we could prove in particular in the areas of maritime safety and a European maritime transport area. I only need to mention coordination in the event of collisions in our territorial waters. It is absolutely crucial that EMSA also receives excellent cooperation from the Member States when it comes to towing capacity, oil spill clean-up vessels, control ships and control aircraft, identifying environmental polluters, recording the data in SafeSeaNet and actually carrying out key tasks very efficiently.</p>
      <p sl="de">The discussion regarding a unified coast guard is, of course, an excellent one if it is a question of saying that we are, in principle, shifting more and more tasks in the direction of the European Union. However, if we look at the situation in the Member States as a whole, then we have to note that control work is sometimes carried out three or four times over. Here we have the national police service, which, in principle, provides border protection. Then we have customs, which also carries out its tasks independently. Then there is fisheries surveillance and, finally, the waterway police. Sensible coordination of these things has the potential to yield enormous savings, which we ought to make use of.</p>
      <p sl="de">A satellite maritime navigation system was mentioned. It is particularly important for us to equip the very busy routes with this sort of maritime safety navigation system via Galileo. I am thinking of the Bosphorus, Gibraltar and the Kadet Trench.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card answer. – I think that was more of a statement than a question. I am sure we are agreed on this point, Mr van Dalen. In specific terms, it is about monitoring oil and gas platforms, as you said, but against the background of the fact that, globally, we have just faced a scenario with Deepwater Horizon that has simply resulted in our need to monitor these activities to a greater degree with a view to prevention, too. It is therefore necessary for EMSA to assume this task.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I first wish to add my voice to all those warmly praising the rapporteur. Mr Fleckenstein has done a really good job.</p>
      <p sl="pl">If I may, I should like to move directly on to the regulation. From the regulation in question, and the debate, we know that the European Maritime Safety Agency has been in operation for eight years. This agency is put to the test every day in practice, since it organises inspections at sea and prevents pollution of different kinds. Among the positive aspects of the agency’s work which we have not yet discussed are its monthly newsletters, which have a readership of more than 2 000. One can therefore say that the overall assessment of the agency’s work is definitely positive. I would nevertheless like to draw attention to two factors. The first problem relates to the fact that the agency is currently primarily concerned with maritime transport. I believe, however, that the various risks relating to oil and gas extraction in increasingly difficult conditions demand more serious discussion. The second problem is the fact that the regulation extends the work of this agency, adding 14 new areas of activity. It is quite unclear to me whether new and additional resources will be found for these new tasks in coming years and financial perspectives.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the European Maritime Safety Agency, which was set up in the wake of the Erika oil tanker incident, carries out an important role in pollution response and should be commended for its work in this area, which was emphasised by my good colleague, Peter van Dalen.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, this latest modification of the EMSA regulation extends that competence. This may seem harmless and even beneficial for Member States, but the ‘S’ in EMSA stands for ‘Safety’ and this must not be forgotten. This is not a social services agency. I am particularly concerned about extending EMSA’s competence to include the analysis of the safety of mobile off-shore and gas installations. Oil and gas installations are currently regulated to a very high international standard and duplication is not needed. The same applies to the fight against piracy, the training of seafarers and the certification of ships. There, I agree with the Commission’s position. I also do not support the creation of a European coastguard. We have seen competency creep before, and I would not want to see it here.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, increased competency means increased costs, and in these difficult economic times, any calls for increases in funding must be supported by rigorous justification. I am afraid I do not see ample justification here.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, in the first place, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the proposal for an amendment to the regulation of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), in particular, in regard to the extension of its powers. EMSA, which provides support and technical assistance in matters of safety as well as maritime protection against pollution caused by ships, has been growing in importance in the defence of the marine environment. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the quality of the work that I have had the opportunity to see in person on my visits to this agency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am pleased that this report will strengthen aspects for which I have fought in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), and which have now been approved in plenary through the Ford report. These are mechanisms of prevention and response in the event of environmental disasters associated with maritime oil and gas rigs. In times of economic and financial crisis such as we are now experiencing, and in view of economies of scale, it makes complete sense to make use of existing infrastructure and to broaden the agency’s powers rather than to create new structures or a new agency.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I would emphasise the need for coordination at EU level, as well as with neighbouring countries, in order to ensure better practice and to harmonise the different approaches used in the different regions of the EU, whether this relates to accident prevention or response coordination. Only a comprehensive approach will allow us to achieve greater security in activities in the oil and gas sector and to tackle environmental, economic and social damage caused by accidents at sea.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for the work done, and stress my support for the strengthening of capacities for the prevention of, response to and combating of marine pollution, particularly on oil and gas rigs. As mentioned in the report, in order for this strengthening to be effective, it should be accompanied, where necessary, by appropriate financial and staff resources. The sea and its resources are a global asset, so solutions should be coordinated with the involvement of all stakeholders.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Cooperation with third countries and the application of already existing innovative services, in particular, by using the potential of the EGNOS and Galileo programmes, should be stimulated to create a real border-free European maritime area. As sea routes are a key tool for consolidating this space, I would call for more attention to be given to maritime transport, and that priority be given to removing the various obstacles that it faces on a daily basis.</p>

Above all, I wish to stress that I greatly appreciate the activities of EMSA in matters relating to safety and environmental protection at sea. I also consider it necessary to regulate the tasks currently performed by EMSA and to define the areas it might deal with in future, as mentioned by the previous speakers. I believe that the definition of the agency’s tasks and organisational framework should be conducive to its substantive involvement in emerging new issues in the maritime sector. I also think that clarification of EMSA’s tasks requires technical assistance from international organisations such as the IMO.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the strengthening of the mandate for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) as proposed in this report, and I would like to support this great need to deepen integration of maritime safety by giving the example of transnational cooperation in the English Channel, which is in decline.</p>
      <p sl="fr">After 10 years of Franco-British cofinancing of an emergency tow vessel, the UK Government has now decided to stop funding the vessel as part of its cutbacks, thereby reducing the safety of that sea crossing, one of the busiest in the world, which is being hit hard by the impact of privatising these services and the lack of a shared vision.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is therefore vital that the national authorities responsible for transposing this legislation – primarily the national coastguard services – act in unison in order to guarantee the efficiency and durability of transnational actions. I therefore believe it is of utmost importance for EMSA to show concern for safety in the English Channel and coordinate the action taken by Member States in that area.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, the European Maritime Safety Agency has already demonstrated that certain tasks, such as satellite monitoring systems, can be carried out more efficiently at European level. In order to develop innovative applications and services, improve existing applications and services, and create a border-free European maritime area, the agency should tap the potential offered by the EGNOS, GALILEO and GMES programmes. With a view to achieving the single market in the EU, short-distance maritime transport should be used more, and we should use the Blue Belt project to reduce the administrative burden on maritime transport.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The agency should also assist the Commission and Member States in developing and implementing the EU’s ‘e-maritime’ initiative, which is designed to improve the efficiency of the maritime sector through better use of information technologies. In line with its remit, the agency should also intervene outside its territory by promoting the EU’s maritime safety policy by means of cooperation through research.</p>

We must seek to ensure that the revised regulation improves and enhances the agency’s work even more and ensures appropriate solutions for its tasks and challenges and a more effective provision of advice and technical and scientific assistance to Member States and the Commission. The proposed regulation properly indicates the agency’s tasks and role and ensures greater clarity as to its activities. To ensure that its activities and tasks are properly accomplished, appropriate powers and material resources are essential. We also have to guarantee that the agency is able to develop technical cooperation more easily and effectively with third countries that have common maritime borders. To avoid EMSA’s work being duplicated by other institutions, the agency must have a very clear strategy, must enjoy our clear political support, and must also guarantee greater added value throughout the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Operation Atalanta is only active along the coast of Somalia, not Kenya or the rest of the Horn of Africa. The Foreign Affairs Council has extended Operation Atalanta to 2014 and we have seen how, as a result of vessel monitoring, there have been fewer attacks, although they do continue, which is why we need the Commission, the Council and the Member States to step up their actions. However, as this agency depends on the Commission, we are calling on the Commission to launch a harmonised, horizontal action, with the appropriate funding, to provide greater protection for European Union vessels, especially fishing vessels. This will enable us to ensure more Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, last year, when I drew up the report on integrated maritime policy, the accident in the Gulf of Mexico had just happened. At that time, we were already considering what we could do in order to be able to intervene better in such cases and how we could also implement some form of preventive measures. At the time, we came up with the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). I would therefore also like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Fleckenstein for his excellent work. It really is important for us to look at what institutions we have and to consider how we can involve them further and in different ways.</p>
      <p sl="de">The sea is, in general, being used more, and, in future, it will be used significantly more still, because it also contains raw materials. It is important not only for shipping, but also for energy production. In this regard, however, it is important to consider how we can protect the sea. If we have an institution that is perfectly capable of doing this with additional powers, then we ought to instruct it to do so.</p>
      <p sl="de">It will obviously need funds for this, but that is why it was right for us to say to the Commission during the budget debate when it wanted to cut back on the funding for the agencies that that was not on. We already knew, with regard to EMSA in particular, that we would be giving it an additional task.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I believe that EMSA should continue to exist and that its basic mission, to control safety at sea and protect human life at sea and the environment, should be extended. Having read the report, it seems to me that it goes into issues and overlaps with other issues, such as piracy or the common coastguard, which may in fact change the very nature of EMSA. I should like to take this opportunity to point out that there are numerous fields in which EMSA provides scientific support and makes a decisive contribution; this applies to maritime pollution, not only by ships, but also by shore industries and fish farms. It can also help to prevent accidents and protect human life at sea.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to close with the following fact: the cost of maritime pollution on a global scale is EUR 256 billion at 2006 prices. It has serious repercussions on the health of the inhabitants of coastal areas and on the environment. The scope of the Commission’s work is broad, which is why it should not break into and allow itself to be diverted into sectors which come under the jurisdiction of other operators.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members very much for their mostly very positive remarks about the work of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). How many agencies do we have in Europe? Close to 30; and EMSA is one of the most efficient and well-functioning agencies.</p>
      <p sl="en">These discussions and Mr Fleckenstein’s report make a valuable contribution to fine-tuning EMSA’s task and also to making all stakeholders and partners aware of the available possibilities to use information held by EMSA and of how cooperation can be improved as regards the fight against piracy and the better functioning of maritime business.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission enthusiastically supports the development of the European Maritime Safety Agency. Of course there are limits, as you understand very well. Everything depends on human and financial resources and, under the current circumstances, there is not a very big increase to be expected in these resources. But, within these resources, we can regroup and reorganise the work as well.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank those involved once again for their cooperation and also those who have just spoken for their contributions to the debate. There are naturally a few things that have not received adequate mention in our debate, as there has not been enough time – apprehending environmental polluters for example, and you mentioned piracy.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would just like to make one thing clear once again, Mr van Dalen. This report does not call for a European coastguard. We are, however, asking to finally receive the expert opinion that we want – as decided by this Parliament a long time ago – on how this coastguard should be structured and what advantages and disadvantages it would have.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Gallagher mentioned that EMSA saves the Member States a lot of money. That is correct. Now the issue of a coastguard could be seen as an example of the fact that we will only really have these synergy effects if we do not merely set something up jointly but if, back in our Member States, we also remember what was decided in Brussels and reduce the national structures accordingly. Only then will we see the synergy effects. Where one or two transport ministers are concerned, I have the impression that they join in the decision-making process in Brussels but then forget to tell anyone back home that adjustments need to be made as a result. I am a German MEP so I know what I am talking about.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, we could not regulate everything. The gender issue is something we are taking seriously. Nevertheless, it is obviously difficult to regulate the gender issue in a satisfactory way in bodies to which 27 Member States each send one person. As regards competences – whether national or regional – we sometimes had the feeling in committee that this was a Spanish domestic discussion. It is all the same to me whether it is national or regional. The authorities must be the competent authorities, and that is what will make them the right points of contact. How the competence is determined is up to others at a local level.</p>
      <p sl="de">My final point is that EMSA contains an ‘S’ for ‘safety’, you are absolutely right about that. However, Ms Foster, if you believe that as far as oil platforms are concerned, there are particularly good regulations in place, then I would remind you once again of what I said earlier: 500 accidents on oil and gas drilling rigs in 2008 show that we really need to consider how we can improve this situation and perhaps also integrate this within an agency that already deals with similar problems.</p>

      <p sl="de">All of us have painful memories of the images of the burning Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the spring of 2010. Outdated technology and the conscious acceptance of safety risks led to the two-month long outflow of incredible quantities of crude oil. As we all know, the consequences for people and the environment were disastrous.</p>
      <p sl="de">The fact that there is a danger of the same thing happening at the 450 drilling rigs in the North Sea, for example, was demonstrated in August of this year by the oil leak in the Gannet Alpha pipelines off the Scottish coast.</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore welcome the proposal put before us to extend the areas of competence of the European Maritime Safety Agency in this regard, so that in future, safety inspections can also be carried out on oil drilling rigs. EMSA has already proven its ability to act in connection with past tanker disasters. On the basis of this experience, I believe that the proposed extension of the areas of competence is preferable to the creation of a new agency.</p>
      <p sl="de">In addition, this kind of European solution to maritime safety problems is preferable to having national supervisory authorities. The faster lines of communication and the cross-border consequences of incidents such as oil disasters can only be tackled at European level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Maritime Safety Agency was set up in response to the pollution caused by tanker disasters. Today, everything must be done to widen the scope of the matters dealt with by the agency. Combating pollution at sea and ensuring compliance with the requirements of maritime safety and environmental protection must become the agency’s priority. The agency should, in particular, strengthen cooperation with third countries in waters where oil and gas are prospected and extracted. This will help prevent future environmental disasters. The idea of a European maritime transport area without barriers, involving the simplification of the formalities required to carry goods and passengers between European Union Member States, is also noteworthy. Also deserving of our support is the Blue Belt project. It will allow the administrative burden on short-sea shipping to be reduced. It also provides the assurance that a ship declaring intra-EU goods has only visited EU ports, and this will facilitate customs clearance. Finally, I call on Parliament to ensure that the agency’s broader remit is transparent and clearly set out. This will avoid both internal and international conflicts of interest in this field.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Mathieu Grosch, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area – Towards a competitive and resource-efficient transport system (2011/2096(INI)) (A7-0425/2011).</p>

    <intervention id="3-407-000" speaker_id="2247" name="Mathieu Grosch" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Kallas, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we took the debate on the White Paper on transport for the next few decades very seriously. Following an initial report, we refined the focus of our opinion by making 413 amendments. However, we have found a good basis for setting priorities for the future, in particular, by means of 32 compromises. This was possible due to the readiness of my colleagues in committee to enter into dialogue. I would like to thank them very much for this, as well as all the members of staff who helped to make this report into something really unified.</p>
      <p sl="de">It is worth it because when we talk about transport, we are talking about over 10 million workers in Europe, more than 5% of GDP and, ultimately, something that affects the day-to-day lives of almost all citizens. Thus, this really is a key competence of European policy. The White Paper puts the emphasis in the right places. The emphasis is on economic, environmental and safety aspects, where energy and CO2 remain the priorities, of course.</p>
      <p sl="de">First of all, however, we wanted to send a clear message to the Council. We want a swift and clear transposal of EU directives, but we see that this is not always the case in the Council and that the borders between Member States that we want to abolish are very often reconstructed as a result of transposal in the Council.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the debate, we agreed on many words and concepts relating to efficient co-modality. For me, however, what is important is the fact that this efficiency includes the aspect of economic efficiency just as much as it does the aspects of environmental protection, safety and the right working conditions. All of this will give us an efficient transport policy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We have initially limited ourselves to the next 10 years and have put forward 31 clear proposals in this regard, primarily with regard to safety, particularly in connection with road transport. We are still seeing more than 40 000 deaths and more than 400 000 serious injuries a year. We want clear measures for the next 10 years up to 2020 in order to reduce these figures by 50%.</p>
      <p sl="de">Of course, CO2 is, and remains, a priority for us, too. In this regard, we are setting a target of 20% less than the 1990 levels for the next 10 years. It is possible for us to achieve that, among other things using an energy mix – not only electro-mobility, we want an energy mix. However, we also want a better modal distribution and we do not want to underestimate urban transport, either – with respect for subsidiarity. After all, 80% of citizens will be living in urban centres in future and, for example, environmentally friendly modes of transport right down to pedestrians and bicycles, Mr Cramer, create alternatives that will make this transport much more environmentally friendly and sustainable.</p>
      <p sl="de">Where CO2 is concerned, however, we are also considering airspace. Why are we waiting so long to implement this when we know that, with simple decisions and without investing any money, we could, at the end of the day, save 20%?</p>
      <p sl="de">We also share your view of the single European transport area. We want to abolish the frontier effects. We want to open up the markets. We also want to make transport much more efficient. However, for the future – and I am thinking in particular of road transport here – we also do not want to have the cheapest transport at the expense of health and the environment, but we want the right prices under the right conditions for the environment and also for the people who work in this sector.</p>
      <p sl="de">All of this will, of course, also result in us in Europe, together with the Commission, calling for a coherent European transport network. However, we want to set points of focus there, too. Bottlenecks that we have been aware of for years must be eradicated. Frontier effects must also be eliminated. The money is not simply there for the Member States to do with what they will. We want to create European added value here and accordingly also guarantee the funding.</p>
      <p sl="de">These are just a few examples of how we see the future. In any case, Commissioner, we would like to discuss these specific measures with the Commission in future and also implement them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Commission White Paper ‘Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area’, adopted on 28 March 2011, defines a vision for a competitive and resource-efficient transport system and a policy agenda for the coming years.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Mathieu Grosch, and the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the input given to the Commission throughout this exercise. It all started with the report on the 2009 communication on a sustainable future for transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe there is wide agreement on the importance of preserving an efficient and competitive transport sector. Transport is an essential support for the internal market and the economic integration of all regions of Europe in the global economy. Transport is also an important economic sector itself, with 10 million jobs in transport services and another 8 million in the manufacture of transport vehicles. Transport is also essential for social and territorial cohesion.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is why I am convinced that curbing mobility is not a sensible alternative in order to make transport sustainable. But I am also convinced that, without finding ways of using less and cleaner energy and of better exploiting infrastructure, we will be forced into such a detrimental alternative.</p>
      <p sl="en">The White Paper sets a target for a 60% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 with respect to 1990 and ten goals that will benchmark progress until that date. There are 40 concrete initiatives which the Commission intends to take within the current mandate in order to address transport challenges. We are fully committed to this agenda. The Commission will, in 2011, deliver about 20% of the initiatives listed in the White Paper – and not the least important ones.</p>
      <p sl="en">I will continue, based on the wide support given in your report to several key proposals, such as the internalisation of external costs of transport; the Single European Sky; the maritime Blue Belt; urban sustainable mobility plans and, in general, the completion of the internal market in transport.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commission announced in its work programme, I intend to put forward very ambitious proposals next year. Concerning rail, the programme should include measures to develop the European single railway area. New legislation should also contribute to the development of clean fuel vehicles and priorities set for innovation and technological development. We will also make further steps towards the full internalisation of all externalities and for the elimination of tax distortions.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, transport is the foundation of our economy and society. It contributes to economic growth and job creation. However, the development of this economic sector must be sustainable and take place in the context of international cooperation. European infrastructure management and transport systems should aim to increase the competitiveness and attractiveness of the entire European Union, and this can only be achieved by eliminating the effects which restrict the free flow of transport between Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion on the creation of a Single European Transport Area, I, above all, stress the need to switch to technologies based on lower emission non-fossil fuels, the need to reduce energy and fuel consumption by promoting environmentally friendly vehicles or fuel-efficient technologies, and support for research to accelerate the introduction of eco-innovations and new technologies in transport. A very important aspect is also the development of infrastructure, including road infrastructure, in new Member States, which should be taken into account in multiannual financial plans.</p>

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, in the European Union as a whole, one third of energy consumption is attributable to the transport sector. Mostly, they are petroleum products, and Europe as a whole imports 80% of its petroleum products. It is therefore clear that we are not only dependent on imports, but that with respect to energy in the transport sector, we are excessively dependent on imports. Our purpose consequently should be to reduce our dependence on imported energy in the transport sector. How then can this be done? There are three main ways. First, we have to use existing fuels more efficiently. Second, we have to expand the use of biofuels; and third, we have to use hybrid and electric car technologies better. Ladies and gentlemen, I support this report because in general, it will contribute to the reduction of our dependence on energy imports in the transport sector. I urge everyone else to support it, too.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, transport is, for many people, still a burden, a nuisance, that unfortunately consumes resources and produces noise and environmental damage, but at the same time, mobility is more essential today than it has ever been before. It is necessary for the functioning of our societies, both internally and in dealings between our societies. It is the basis of our prosperity and a symbol of individual freedom. It is a basic requirement that I would like to see developed further into a basic right for everyone, particularly for older people and people with disabilities.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would therefore like to thank and praise the Commission for its visions in the White Paper, even though I do not agree with all the details in every case. The fundamental concern of making transport more efficient, cleaner and safer and not restricting it arbitrarily or shifting modes at any price is something that I support wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to express my particular appreciation to our rapporteur, Mr Grosch. He has succeeded in picking out the added value in transport policy and drawing up coherent, specific objectives without calling technological openness into question. The aim of having EU-wide standards for safety, passengers and goods, transport chains, information and communications systems, energy and the environment, but also for working and social conditions, is something that I very much welcome.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, I very much regret the lack of courage to take a position with regard to road trains, which I rightly call eco-liners. Although the reference to subsidiarity sounds good, it is nevertheless merely a way of yielding to the critics of these vehicles. With regard to the use of eco-liners in particular, I would call for shared competence. That is a lot better. With the text in the report, we are missing an opportunity to develop minimum standards, specifications and framework conditions that the Member States could apply when conducting their approval procedures according to the principle of subsidiarity. Thus, I fear that a European patchwork of approval and application criteria will emerge that we will later have to eliminate with a great deal of expense and bureaucracy. We are also missing an opportunity for a new vehicle design. Such vehicles must be fitted with the most important environmental protection and safety-related vehicle assistance systems.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the European Commission’s vision for 2050 is an important document in terms of setting the future directions of European transport policy. We therefore see it not only as material for discussion, but particularly as a framework in which there will be specific objectives and steps over the short and medium term. In the report, we therefore call on the Commission specifically to set out these objectives up to 2020. It is also important to take the current situation as the point of departure. European transport policy must clearly build on previous documents, while also reflecting the initial state of the infrastructure in all Member States. In the resulting proposal, we therefore call on the Commission to submit an analysis of the current situation as soon as possible, and no later than 2013. The instruments of cohesion policy must therefore continue to support a more rapid convergence of infrastructure levels in the Member States, with an emphasis on sustainable and safe transport. The resulting compromise also deals with the very important area of transport workers’ conditions. The sector employs about 10 million people, and this must form an important component of our thinking on transport, whether in terms of job quality, work safety, training or education.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Transport cannot work without people. Their work conditions must therefore be in keeping with this demanding and responsible profession, and must have a direct impact on transport safety. Effective cooperation between the different forms of transport constitutes an important component both of future transport policy and of the EU’s long-term emissions reduction targets. I therefore consider it important for us to agree in the final compromise on a demand to support sustainable forms of transport, and to do so for all distances. At the same time, I agree with Commission’s view that we should approach long-distance transport systematically at a pan-European level.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur for his great effort in negotiating acceptable compromises. I hope we will approve the resulting proposal tomorrow by a large majority.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Grosch, the work that has been done here is truly excellent. There were 413 amendments, and we genuinely all supported the majority of the 32 compromises. It shows that we all know that it is important to take as united an approach as possible with regard to the subject of transport. Of course, we have different ideas in the various groups about the details of individual matters, but by and large, we all said that transport is important. It really is the backbone of the internal market. It is a foundation of European policy that we say that we want free movement of people, goods and services. For this, we clearly need to make various improvements, which we will continue to do in subsequent reports.</p>
      <p sl="de">We can truly say that it has just become clear – and it is also clear in this report – that we need all modes of transport. Naturally, we want transport to be more efficient, more environmentally friendly and safer. That is something that we all need to take into consideration. However, in order to be able to continue to take the internal market forward, we really need all modes of transport, even if one area might produce higher emissions than another. That has become very clear in this case.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are essentially very few points on which we do not agree. One of them concerns road trains. This is currently very elegantly worded. I know that not all parties will agree, but in this regard, it is the case that we need a European modular system. In other words, we wanted an option to have a larger volume or perhaps also a bit more length and a bit more weight in the lorries. Not everyone thinks that is a good idea. However, in some areas of Europe, that has already been put into practice – and successfully. This system cannot be used everywhere.</p>
      <p sl="de">On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to refer to an amendment that we tabled after the vote. I think it is more correct, and should also meet with much approval, to say that it is not a question of us asking the Commission to submit something relating to the railway package describing the relationship between the network and operators, but rather that it should actually be about the separation of the network and operators, which we also addressed in the recast of the railway package. That is a correction, so I would imagine that everyone would be able to go along with it. Thank you once again. I look forward to tomorrow’s vote.</p>

      <p sl="de">Without changing our mobility, we will not be able to combat climate change and then our children and their children will have no prospects when it comes to living here. Why is that? Since 1990, we have achieved a reduction in CO2 emissions of 34% in industry, 17% in the energy sector and 14% in households. Over the same period, emissions from transport have increased by 30%. Thus, we can say that all the savings made in other sectors using billions of euro of our tax revenues are being eaten up twice and three times over by the transport sector. That is why we need to change our transport system.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am very pleased that we have succeeded in finding a compromise, that we want to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% by 2020, and that this is based on the figures from 1990 and not those from 2008 as the Commission wanted – as well as it only wanting to achieve the target by 2030. We have set higher targets. I call on the Commission to also accept this decision. We have no time to lose. We need to act quickly.</p>
      <p sl="de">I approve of the fact that we have set out the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport. After all, air transport is subsidised by European taxpayers to the tune of EUR 30 billion a year because it is exempt from kerosene tax and VAT, whereas rail transport has to pay everything. We have a mandatory rail toll for every locomotive. Road tolls are a voluntary matter for the Member States to decide on and only apply to motorways. Therefore, we need to change this.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are pleased that the EuroVelo routes have been integrated into the trans-European network. As regards gigaliners, all I can say is: anyone who acquires these – 52% of goods transport is being shifted from the railways to the roads – and anyone who still calls these eco-liners really has not understood what is important in this world!</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mathieu Grosch for his tremendous work on this report. Unfortunately, however, this does not change the uncomfortable foundations for the report – that is to say, the Commission’s White Paper on which it is based. Now I want to be fair to the Commission document; it does make some positive suggestions about the need for a fully functioning multimodal network and the importance of modernising our air traffic management system via SESAR.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the report has a major flaw in my opinion. Yet again, the Commission believes more regulation and more EU intervention are the answer. Indeed, at a time when confidence is one of the most important factors for our businesses across the EU, the last message we should be sending is one of stifling growth. As such, the proposals in this report to harmonise work and social conditions and various other measures in that sector are beyond reason. What we should be doing is repealing punitive legislation, not adding to it. Moreover, the suggestions in the report for increased taxation on certain transport modes send a damaging message to industry. The report also calls for an increase in road charging. I must ask how the Commission believes this could possibly not be a contradiction of their stated aim not to curb mobility.</p>
      <p sl="en">The same applies to the idea of banishing vehicles with traditional combustion engines from city centres. It is as unachievable as it is undesirable, especially in these times of economic difficulty. The report is interventionist to its core and holds no regard for the principle of subsidiarity. Here we have the opportunity to send out a positive message to business that we will boost the internal market and support growth. Instead, we have a document which is punitive to business, our economy and therefore our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the policy to liberalise and integrate the internal transport market in the European Union is a highly anti-grassroots policy. Public transport has been sold off to monopoly groups and we have seen mass redundancies, across-the-board application of flexible forms of work, drastic reductions in transport workers’ pay, increasing slavery of workers and a deterioration in safety rules, with a resultant increase in accidents. Ticket and freight prices have shot through the roof, there has been a drastic fall in the standard of transport services and remote continental and island areas have no transport links, with painful consequences on public health and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="el">The abolition of cabotage and short-haul flights in Greece, alongside the insulting support for transport groups in the form of a State aid package, has resulted in the isolation of remote island areas and huge increases in ticket prices. Now that the Hellenic Railways Organisation has been sold off, entire areas now have no rail link and thousands of workers have been thrown on to the street. Galley conditions apply in air transport.</p>

The transport sector is not just important for the development of the European Union, its regions and towns; it is also important for European citizens because it provides jobs for many Europeans and serves the completion of the European internal market. Transport must make a significant contribution to the EU 2020 strategy, particularly with regard to employment, sustainable economic growth, research, energy, innovation and the environment.</p>
      <p sl="lt">I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that some Member States underestimate the European added value of transport policy and obstruct it by implementing directives and the projects themselves incorrectly or late.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the message has apparently not reached Brussels yet that we are in the middle of a serious economic crisis. This report, a road map for a single European transport area, wants to spend more money on unprofitable European railway connections. It is not that I am against trains, Mr President, but throughout the report, the railways are given preferential treatment as compared to road or air travel.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The fact that the Brussels bureaucrats completely disregard the current economic reality is, unfortunately, no surprise when I read the report. It is full of references to the White Paper and the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, the main question is not asked: what is in this investment of billions for Europe’s citizens? The bias of the Brussels elite is going to cost the citizen billions, at a time when national railways are already kept going with enormous subsidies.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Despite these huge amounts of State aid, the railways’ share in terms of total transport demand has only fallen in recent years. Europeans are apparently opting to travel by car or by air. These losses must, of course, be paid for by somebody. Under the guise of climate targets, the efficient air and road transport sectors can simply be saddled with the railways’ losses.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Mr President, while the Brussels bureaucrats are striving to create a single transport area, railways are being favoured over road and air transport because of climate targets. Let us first put a stop to this preferential treatment of the railways. Only then will taxpayers’ money end up where it can most quickly contribute to prosperity in the countries of Europe.</p>

      <p sl="de">Blue-card question. – Mr President, Ms Stassen, you said that railways are given preferential treatment. Do you know that railways have to pay for all their energy consumption, they have to pay for fuel for diesel locomotives and that air transport is exempt from this, amounting to EUR 30 billion every year? Do you know that on the railways, there is a mandatory rail toll for every locomotive for every kilometre of track that a train covers with no upper limit, whereas on the roads it is entirely up to the Member States whether any road toll is collected at all? This mostly applies only on motorways for lorries above 12 tonnes and it is also capped. Therefore, do you continue to maintain this? Who is subsidised here then? Why can pupils and students take intercity flights for the same price as a short taxi journey, but travelling by rail is two to three times more expensive, and the state pockets the VAT to boot?

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the White Paper on transport, the European Parliament discusses, among other things, regulation of the flow of traffic so that the economy in our European Union remains in motion or is set in motion and the environment is protected. As rapporteur, Mr Grosch has put forward excellent proposals, including for the optimal use of appropriate modes of transport and a mix of different modes of transport. In this regard, we see that not all modes of transport make sense and are suitable to be used in all regions and all countries. In this connection, I would refer to the so-called gigaliners. These are the heavy goods vehicles that are a third longer and twice as heavy as the heavy goods vehicles previously approved and used. For my country, Austria, the use of these huge lorries would be completely nonsensical from an economic point of view. For measures for converting the infrastructure that needs to be adapted, even if we only had to carry these out on transit routes, for example, on bridges or at emergency stopping places, motorway services or roundabouts, we would have to spend in the region of EUR 1 billion.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, with the amendments that we have tabled in respect of paragraph 26, we have succeeded in ensuring that there will not be Europe-wide approval of these gigaliners. It will be the Member States who will be able to decide in future whether or not they will approve these lorries within their territory. What is good for Sweden’s timber transport and its timber and transport industry is a long way from being acceptable and sensible for crossing the Alps in Austria. I am therefore pleased that we have achieved this compromise and that the Member States are free to choose whether or not to approve this mode of transport on their roads.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is important for this Parliament because it gives our work in the coming years direction. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur for the way in which he has approached the matter. He has succeeded in proposing good compromises for the main issues. I will limit myself to three key points.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The first is the importance of the social dimension of transport. One cannot further open up and liberalise the transport market in the coming years without doing anything about the social aspect. The social bar must be set at the same level, and that is why it is vital to my group that the Commission should, by around 2013, issue a thorough analysis of the social conditions as well as the market and employment conditions for all means of transport. On that basis, proposals will have to be made with a view to creating a level playing field at a high level for all employees. This is important in order to guarantee the attractiveness of the sector.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, we must make the transport sector more efficient and more sustainable, otherwise we will get nowhere and that would cost our economy and the environment very dear. There are no magic potions to sort it out. This will require a mixture of measures relating to price incentives and a better energy mix, the right investments to find sustainable alternatives and the introduction of new technologies. Important paragraphs are devoted to this, for which I thank the rapporteur.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, I wish to stress the importance of technical interoperability, particularly in the railways sector, but not just there. The rapporteur referred to air transport, an area in which a more integrated European airspace has been able to bring huge efficiency gains. However, this demands all the more work for the railways. It is infuriating that, for example, Thalys still needs seven safety and signalling systems in order to operate in three countries because approval and certification procedures are different and each time need to be repeated. In brief, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of work before us, and I think that this report forms a good basis for the coming years.</p>

Finding the right balance between these priorities and interests — as evidenced by more than 400 proposals — was difficult, as in fact was finding the balance between proper or balanced transport-sector development and requirements to promote competitiveness and to protect the environment and reasonable financial demands on both taxpayers and the transport industry. There is a range of positive elements in the report, which also draws attention to the differences in the development levels of infrastructure in the European Union, the establishment of the European single market for transport and the reduction of fossil fuels in transport. However, the European Conservatives and Reformists Group finds it difficult to support the overall tendency of the report to always seek solutions by resorting to European Union regulation, which, taking into account the differences I mentioned, is very difficult for some Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, once again, while invoking just objectives, what is desired is to pursue aims that are very different. The report refers to environmental objectives, energy efficiency, decarbonisation and interoperability. This is all very well, but there should be clarity about what it is really driving at. Here, we have an insistence on the liberalisation of the transport sector, in other words, the privatisation of everything that could yield a profit, to the detriment of users who see prices rising and security declining; for workers as they lose their rights and are being made redundant; and for national economies, which are deprived of a basic tool for development.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Every country has its needs and priorities at this level, resulting from its own specific characteristics and relative level of development. The question that arises, therefore, is this: what interests will be served by this European transport policy? Will it be the interests of the European multinationals, with their desire to flood the markets with their products swiftly and at minimal cost? This is surely different from the interests of national small and medium-sized enterprises and from the interests of the population, looking on as the railroads close and the price of transport spirals, as is happening in Portugal with the backing of the IMF programme and the EU.</p>

I congratulate the rapporteur, who, in just three months, has succeeded in compiling an important document mapping out directions for the near future.</p>
      <p sl="it">I wish to recall the following key points: the creation of a true single market in all areas of transportation, as administrative and technical barriers discourage competition by preventing a lowering of the costs of transport services. I am obviously referring to the railway sector, the situation of which is unacceptable 25 years after the adoption of the Single European Act. The list of barriers hindering this sector is a luxury we cannot afford at a time when the market represents our way out of the difficult situation and the means of reviving our economy. In particular, I am thinking of the opening up of national passenger transport markets, the creation of a European regulator and implementation of Railway Traffic Management System (RTMS) technology throughout the entire Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T).</p>
      <p sl="it">Infrastructure has been mentioned – cross-border systems in particular – and, of course, the linking of the last mile between transport hubs and axes. The funding of infrastructure is unthinkable because with the money assigned to the budget, we can only achieve what has been planned, that is, small infrastructure projects, having real project bonds issued and going beyond the current guarantee schemes, which are useful, however, during this time of crisis.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Project Bond dossier that we have available is related to these guarantees, but we want to go beyond road safety as we have to consider all aspects of the problem: drivers, vehicles, infrastructure and their interaction.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, the Single European Sky ATM Research programme (SESAR), the technological pillar of the Single European Sky, will have to be completed, but we must simultaneously work on a single governance structure.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Commissioner has assured us that next year, there will be some ambitious proposals. We certainly look forward to that.</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, this report deals with the enormous needs within the transport sector. Why are we not doing something about them in a situation where we could combine long-term investments with getting the high rate of unemployment down? TEN-T should be expedited in order to integrate transport systems, improve goods transport and drastically reduce climate-affecting emissions. In this regard, we should also have the courage to consider the idea that we should not be satisfied with a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions in 20 years, but we should go a little further than that.</p>
      <p sl="sv">At the same time, more order is needed within this sector, as well as more fair competition in an area where social dumping will have serious consequences in the form of the ruthless exploitation of those working in this area, which, at the same time, can result in accidents and a reduced level of safety. Thus, we do not need more liberalism within this sector. Instead, we need a more far-sighted approach, more investments, more interconnection and a higher level of safety. We also need decent conditions – something that will not only benefit those who work in the sector, but also all of us who are out and about using the transport systems on our roads and railways.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, the elimination of barriers to the free movement of people, goods, services and capital is our long-term priority. For this reason, I support the European Commission’s effort to create a single European transport area. However, an important precondition for this is the comprehensive and effective interlinking of transport networks across the EU, and the creation of a coherent multimodal network. I consider it right in this regard that the White Paper makes mention several times of the differences between the eastern and western parts of the EU in transport infrastructure.</p>
      <p sl="cs">On the other hand, however, I feel that the White Paper and the Commission’s activities in general lack specific measures for eliminating these differences. The Commission’s activities in the transport area appear to me rather incoherent on this count. I was expecting the Commission to come up with a solution in the form of the proposed infrastructure fund for eliminating the differences in transport infrastructure between eastern and western areas. The fund disappointed me greatly, however, as most of the support is again concentrated on the old Member States, although it takes EUR 10 billion from the Cohesion Policy, which is intended primarily for the weaker regions. This is not only a major disappointment, but a fatal error in terms of European integration.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to such an important and far-reaching subject as the White Paper on the future of transport, the risk is always great that we will end up with something that looks like a Christmas tree with everyone attempting to get two or three of their favourite subjects included.</p>
      <p sl="de">If we look at the result, which we will vote on tomorrow, then we can, without a doubt, congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Grosch. From several hundred amendments, he succeeded in producing a sound, coherent and comprehensible result that places the main focus as regards transport of the future on safety, environmental protection, energy and technology. I expressly welcome the fact that such important issues as the social, health and labour law-related conditions of the employees have been suitably mentioned here. This is particularly important in view of the threat of a shortage of workers in the transport sector, which is something we must actively do something about if we want to prevent bottlenecks for well-trained workers in the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">There is a further opening up of cabotage in road transport only on condition that social dumping and unfair conditions are prevented. I also welcome the fact that improving road safety is considered an important aspect here. The safety of our roads is a subject that we need to concern ourselves with more in the future, too.</p>
      <p sl="de">There are other aspects that I view in a more critical light. Thus, I would have liked there to have been a statement regarding modal shift in order to shift more traffic from the roads to the railways and waterways. For this reason, I think the discussion regarding gigaliners is not the best solution for increased sustainability. Equally worthy of criticism is the further liberalisation of the railway sector, and we ought to wait and give the matter further consideration before opening up national passenger transport. We still have to carry out some technical harmonisation in this area and to establish fair competition conditions.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, as I said, I hope that this report, which expresses the expectations of Parliament, will not remain a pious wish-list, but that we will achieve our goal by 2020 and our proposals will have been put into practice.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I should firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, for the consensus-based approach he took in drafting this resolution. I would also like to pay tribute to Ms Sehnalová, who did not wish to see the liberalisation of port services included in this text.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, may I remind you during the minute I have left – for I was not entirely satisfied with your opening comments in this debate, and I shall explain why in a moment – just how many changes have been recorded since the White Paper on transport was adopted in 2001. Despite all the efforts made, however, it has to be said that transport is still not sustainable 10 years later.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore believe that your proposal of 28 March 2011 does not go far enough in making concrete proposals. During the debate, in view of the road map we shall be adopting tomorrow, I would like you to go further with specific proposals on, for example, reducing CO2 emissions by 20% for road transport and on extending the ‘polluter pays’ principle to all forms of transport.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Recently, you said that Member States should, by 2050, be able to draw on EUR 1 500 billion. How are you planning to propose very short-term legislative measures, between now and 2020, in order to be able to respond to our road map? And how are you going to manage to make that funding available to Member States?</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, a thriving and sustainable transport sector is hugely important to the UK and Europe as a whole, but having the right transport policy is essential to ensure competitiveness, future economic growth and much needed jobs across the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">This means that we do need a long-term vision for transport policy. Ensuring that future growth in the sector is sustainable is a major challenge, and we should discuss ways to encourage and assist industry in reaching those objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I am concerned that the report now lacks a balanced approach. It seems to only offer one solution to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, and that is legislation, legislation or more legislation. It is now too prescriptive and too burdensome, and most of this will lead to extra spending at both national and EU level. Where is the money coming from? Why not look for alternatives to regulatory options, such as the sharing of best practice?</p>
      <p sl="en">We must also take into consideration the efforts made by many sectors to reduce their carbon footprint. For example, in the aviation sector, huge efforts have been made to improve technology through manufacturing and operational changes, but this is never recognised – certainly by some Members of this House – and the Single European Sky, which we hugely support in ECR will, of course, be a great asset in the future in dealing with congestion and other issues. We just need to get the Member States cracking on that, and I am sure the Commissioner will agree.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, if we are to call ourselves sensible legislators, then we must come forward with a rigorous prioritisation of these transport initiatives that will reduce the burden on our already overstretched EU budget, encourage industry and, most importantly, help keep our constituents moving.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Grosch has done an excellent job, and I hope that this will provide sufficient impetus to continue the development of the transport sector on the right track. I have stressed on several occasions in the past that in my opinion, we need to create an inclusive, sustainable, modern, environmentally sound and efficient transport system as soon as possible. One of the key aspects of this is a single charter of passengers’ rights that summarises the rules governing the various sectors of transport. I would specifically like to thank the rapporteur for expressly mentioning people with disabilities under this chapter.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, they are not the only ones I would like to talk about now. As we know, Europe is a seriously ageing society. We, legislators, will be faced with the fact that we need to meet the relevant needs in the legislative process as well. In the coming period, the need for elderly and disabled citizens to also be able to use means of transport freely and under the same set of conditions will be increasingly visible. I believe that this report represents a clear message and I, too, would like to stress that we do need the European Commission to submit a proposal on this in early 2012.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the White Paper on transport was proposed by the Commission in order to set European transport policy goals for the next 20 or 40 years. I know that 40 years is perhaps a very extensive period. However, we must nevertheless bear in mind that transport projects require lengthy planning phases. I therefore support the long-term approach taken by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="de">Let us take a look at the ambitious goals of the Commission, which I support: increased safety through the use of intelligent transport technologies, improved traffic routing using multimodal solutions, the internalisation of external costs and, above all, transport must become even more environmentally friendly. There are some good approaches and, in this regard, I would refer to the legislative proposals for environmentally friendly urban transport up to 2015.</p>
      <p sl="de">While we are on the subject of environmental protection, I would once again like to point out that it is extremely important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions still further. As regards the development of inland waterways, I would also like to take this opportunity to mention once again the planned development of the Danube. In this regard, we must ensure that this does not ultimately damage the natural environment. I would like to quote Mr Cramer here, who quite rightly always says that ships must be adapted to the river and not the other way around.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am pleased to see that good amendments were tabled in this regard. I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for being so ready to compromise.</p>
      <p sl="de">Finally, I would like to mention one more thing: I would have liked us to have implemented the 300 km approach in connection with the shifting of goods transport from the roads onto the railways. However, I would essentially like to say thank you very much and I hope this will be successful.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the effort to create a single European transport area is an important ambition, but it is running into the differences between laws in the area of transport.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The development of international rail transport in particular is considerably limited by national measures. A basic precondition for the creation of a universal European transport area is therefore a sensible level of harmonisation of rules for the individual forms of transport, allowing problem-free transport operations throughout the Union, without unwarranted local restrictions. However, the common European rules should harmonise not just regulations on the implementation of individual forms of transport, but also the technical parameters of transport vehicles. More than a quarter of emissions are produced in the transport sector. Administrative pressure for a reduction in emissions from all forms of transport should therefore be a constant and serious component of European transport policy.</p>

The progress that has been achieved in separate areas, such as the single European railway market, a trans-European core network, the Single European Sky or the increased use of alternative drive technology has been meagre at best. The White Paper certainly contains very impressive climate targets for the transport sector, for example, the CO2 -free area of city logistics, and I ask myself whether we are not deluding ourselves slightly.</p>

The transport sector creates almost 5% of GDP, and provides about 10 million jobs. The transport sector makes a major contribution to the success of industrial policy, boosting competitiveness and the trade balance. A high-quality transport infrastructure is also closely linked to Europe’s position as an industrial and economic centre on a global scale. It is clear from all this that the EU needs a fully functioning single European transport area, with interconnections and interoperability. Barriers at the borders between Member States should be gradually eliminated in all forms of transport in order to eliminate the persistent differences and inequalities between European regions. In this context, it is not desirable for different forms of transport to compete against each other. On the contrary, the different forms of transport should complement each other and …</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is understandable and very clear from all the remarks how large the transport area is and how many details must be improved. We have heard many contradictory statements – some say that this regulation for a single European transport area is needed while others say there is too much regulation. What should we do? Do we really need a single European transport area and, if a project does not move as fast as expected, should we abandon that project? No, on the contrary, we should hold fast to our ambitions and should push ahead with our ideas.</p>
      <p sl="en">Two minutes is not enough time to allow me to elaborate, but I must say that we have enjoyed the cooperation of the Committee on Transport and Tourism in the European Parliament. We have had numerous discussions and will continue to have discussions concerning concrete legislative proposals. You just had a discussion about railway recast – the recast of the first railway package – and it is clear to all how fragmented this area of transport is and how contradictory and different our views and interests are.</p>
      <p sl="en">Many of you raised the issues that this White Paper on this transport concept will lead to an increase in the level of legislation. I, however, do not see how. In industry, it is the producers of railway equipment that mostly complain about different certification procedures in Member States. These procedures take enormous amounts of money and time. Therefore, the proposal is to harmonise this and create a European certification system for new railway equipment. Is that more regulation or less regulation? Is Blue Belt, for instance, to reduce formalities for ships? Is that more regulation or less regulation? I can definitely assure you that the Commission is trying to create a legislative framework to develop a transport system which will contain as little bureaucracy as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must address the issue of congestion and we must address the issue of CO2 emissions and also fuel dependency. If we do not have Europe-wide answers to these questions, then we will probably be the cause of a lot of disappointment for business, for citizens and Member States everywhere. Let us work with these concrete proposals next week. One big one is already in process. This is a trans-European network proposal and the connecting Europe facility proposal, which is a tremendously different proposal compared with the many previous proposals, and railway proposals are following. Again, there is the possibility to discuss how to overcome the national and political fragmentation of this particular transport mode.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their contributions, and I would like to come back once again to Mr Kósa and say that transport is very much there to support people. If we design it to be appropriate for disabled people, then it will clearly also be appropriate for the elderly and even families. Thus, this was an important priority that we set ourselves for the future.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are not drawing up directives for the sake of drawing up directives. We draw up directives when we are convinced that one European regulation is much simpler than 27 separate ones. Therefore, I sometimes think it is very inconsistent for certain Members to go back home and say that Europe makes their lives so difficult. They just want to live by their own rules, but then want the whole of Europe to accept the rules of their country. That is unacceptable. I therefore think that here in this Parliament, we deal with the rules in a very reasonable way.</p>
      <p sl="de">Certain Members and also certain countries are unreasonable in the way they deal with our proposals. At certain times, we cannot reach any consensus. We have just heard an example: for one person, the eco-liner is the product that can improve capacity in the future and for another person, it is a monster truck because it is damaging to the environment. I believe that Northern Europe can tolerate the eco-liner very well, but we should not see it on the mountain roads of Austria. Therefore, these are examples of areas where we perhaps should not draw up a directive.</p>
      <p sl="de">Commissioner, we will start the practical work tomorrow. We also want to measure what we have said here – over the next few years, year by year, both in the environmental areas and with regard to modal distribution. It is therefore important for us to also have the instruments that will show us, by country and by region, how transport is organised there. That is something that we would like to make a start on together with the Commission, as we believe that all requests made in the future, including, for example, with regard to the trans-European networks, could be prioritised according to these modal distributions. This would also be an instrument that we could set up very quickly together, and it would mean that we were not merely talking in theoretical terms here, but what we have said would, in future, also be measured in practice.

In addition, the transport sector provides jobs for roughly 10 million Europeans, and the prospect of this sector’s continued growth will enable new jobs to be created in every Member State. To ensure that this objective is achieved, the EU and its Member States must cooperate as closely as possible in implementing the relevant EU directives and, in particular, in developing and implementing new investment which can make a significant contribution to the much sought-after economic recovery. Furthermore, a suitable professional training policy is required for everyone working in this sector so that such an important sector as this is not affected by a shortage of qualified staff. I also think that it would be useful for the European Union to examine regularly what stage the implementation of the proposed objectives is at, precisely to be able to find solutions promptly to any problems which arise during implementation of the EU directives.</p>

      <p sl="el">The White Paper is an ambitious plan which, by setting out strategic guidelines for each transport sector and priorities for achieving them, manages to integrate a heterogeneous sector into an ambitious and viable vision for 2050. We have adopted this vision in the Grosch report, which has been enriched with certain additional practical guidelines. Thus, the priority is to complete the progress made with the Eurovignette in internalising the external costs of transport. It is more important than ever that we carefully examine working conditions in the sector, so that we can ensure that the liberalisation of transport sectors will not result in poorer working conditions. At the same time, without deviating from the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission’s high designs for the viability of transport may be supported by new European initiatives for urban mobility. Finally, the intermediate objectives of reducing carbon emissions by 2020 are the result of good intentions, not a comprehensive study. Without a detailed assessment of the potential repercussions, it is difficult to discount the possibility that the target of a 30% reduction in pollutants in shipping will not have the desired results and that the short period of time in question will not undermine the viability of the target and, by extension, the weighting of Parliament’s targets.</p>

The EU’s transport strategy is, to a large extent, based on the factors jointly developed therein. It is vital that the recently drafted White Paper fully meets the needs of the sector whilst identifying emerging trends and needs. It should be stressed that transport is very important for EU citizens since it defines their idea of mobility. EU citizens derive direct benefits from it because it allows them to move about according to the needs arising from their private and professional life. We should remember that this is also one of Europe’s freedoms, namely, freedom of movement.</p>

      <p sl="et">The European transport sector has reached a crossroads. Old problems are still unresolved, and new problems have already arisen. The internal market for transport is not yet completely developed, and solutions must be found to the questions of how to better fulfil residents’ travel desires and satisfy the economy’s freight transport needs, while resource and environmental requirements are becoming more stringent. The transport systems of Eastern and Western Europe must be integrated in such a manner that they reflect the transport needs of our entire continent and its 500 million inhabitants. Although transport has become more energy-efficient, in the EU, 96% of its energy needs still depend on petroleum and petroleum products. Transport has indeed become more environmentally sustainable, but due to increased volumes it is still the main source of noise and local air pollution. Environmental restrictions are often portrayed in the transport sector as a constraining issue that create expenses, but one must look farther into the future – these restrictions serve as an engine of innovation and improvement, and are also accompanied by a better living environment for our citizens. And, of course, efficient transport is also a precondition for fuller and more competitive participation in the global economy, upon which Europe’s future prosperity depends. At the same time, Member States underestimate the added value of transport policy for Europe, and often inhibit it by implementing directives imprecisely or belatedly. The EU’s expenses in connection with the development of transport infrastructure are considerably high, and EUR 215 billion will be needed for the elimination of the main shortcomings of the TEN-T network alone. I sincerely hope that this report will help us move in the desired direction and guarantee the functioning of the transport system that is so essential to us.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I am honoured to have been the promoter of this plenary debate. I believe that European prisons suffer from at least two problems.</p>
      <p sl="it">The first is that it is quite difficult to have the instruments of European democracy enter these institutions. In prisons, there are human rights abuses and people’s dignity is mortified, as concerns both detainees and those who work in the prisons, such as the warders.</p>
      <p sl="it">Prisons are overcrowded, a sign of lack of investment: people are crowded in together and the door is shut. There is little knowledge of prison regulations, while copies of them should be distributed and clearly understood by all.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is abdication of the principal role of re-education that prisons should play, not least because employment for detainees is no longer facilitated inside prisons.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is little transparency and hardly any opening to citizens, schools and non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p sl="it">Budget cuts threaten essential services and the training of personnel and there is an overall lack of interest by the media and politicians.</p>
      <p sl="it">I now go on to the second point. Personally, as part of the initiative that Marco Pannella launched in Italy, for the past three years, I have visited two prisons on 15 August – the day that is most symbolic of holidays – and I have been struck by the absence of the European dimension within them. There are no exchanges of good practices, and few are the moments of contact between the staff and operators from the various European countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">I therefore applaud the publication of this Green Paper, which may cast light on a series of issues: how to improve mutual trust and, naturally, detention conditions; how to associate detention conditions with European regulations on preventive detention, the European arrest warrant, the conditions of minors, the power to inspect, the right to visits by families and all the activities of cultural mediators, which are necessary.</p>
      <p sl="it">The Council is present today and many answers depend on it. We are dealing with a test of civilisation, that is, of European identity.</p>
      <p sl="it">Prisons will always be prisons. I do not believe that the solution lies in emptying them, but they must cease to be those dark corners of rights and European responsibilities.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, the subject of this debate is very important, especially at a time when various initiatives are under way in the judicial cooperation sector in the European Union, in which the concept of mutual trust is applied at every opportunity for EU actions.</p>
      <p sl="el">The European Commission’s Green Paper published recently is fairly indicative of the fact that there is a huge gap between what is being said and the reality of the situation. It sets out numerous problems which we cannot ignore: the worrying differences in detention conditions in the Member States, especially in terms of the number of pre-trial detainees, occupancy levels, abuse of the measure of pre-trial detention and the practical application of the European arrest warrant.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to refer, in particular, to the measure of pre-trial detention. This is, in principle, an exceptional measure which should be applied as a last resort; nonetheless, the use of it in practice is now completely automatic and insufficient consideration is given to the alternative measures available. Furthermore, special attention needs to be paid to vulnerable categories, such as children and adolescents. As regards the European arrest warrant, its proper application cannot be at the expense of basic rights and freedoms. Guarantees are needed to ensure that the necessary means are available for defending suspects and for detention conditions.</p>
      <p sl="el">Even if, therefore, it is easy to turn a blind eye to these issues, we need to highlight and debate them, so that we can find solutions and call for specific measures to improve poor detention conditions, which respect detainees’ human rights and meet the high standards so frequently talked about. That is the only way to achieve a minimum degree of mutual trust; otherwise, these arrangements will be dead letter and will do more harm than good.</p>
      <p sl="el">The motion for a resolution that will be put to the vote in plenary tomorrow moves in this direction. We therefore call on the Commission and the Council to consider the above and to act on the words and the message of the European Parliament, by examining the impact of penal measures and provisions on detention conditions and making recommendations on these issues.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, there is no doubt that among the indicators of the level of a society’s civilisation, the conditions of detainees are certainly present.</p>
      <p sl="it">Overcrowding is a constant characteristic in many Member States, due in part to the significant presence of citizens of other countries: 650 000 detainees is a particularly substantial number. There is a right, just as there is a duty, for them to serve their sentences, obviously so long as the dignity and decorum of the person is guaranteed.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are of the opinion that what is needed is homogeneity and uniformity of treatment, and we feel that cooperation and trust among Member States can exist especially when there is uniformity in the conditions of detainees. This is not the case! In the Member States, there are certain particularly complex realities that must be investigated further.</p>
      <p sl="it">Of course, there are issues connected with those awaiting trial and preventive detention, of which many Member States do not always make prudent and judicious use. Then there is the question of jobs for those who have served their sentences, and their rehabilitation and social redemption, because these are persons who must be given a second chance.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is the problem of harsh sentences for those who have committed serious crimes – first and foremost, those of mafia, organised crime and terrorism. In these cases, the surveillance threshold must obviously remain very high.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mutual recognition among Member States in judicial matters may be of use. We should like to see the Commission and the Council show greater courage and identify this as a priority in the list of matters to address – why not? – with greater means and resources to enlarge and modernise prison facilities: this is specifically mentioned in the Stockholm programme.</p>
      <p sl="it">In the meantime, the Member States must also adopt alternative measures to favour the reintegration of ex-convicts: people must always be offered dignity and decorum.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, the fact that in Europe, there are prisons in which prisoners, suspects and offenders run the risk of illness and violence is a scandal in itself. It is outrageous that there are Member States which, like the Commission, still talk about mutual trust in the rule of law; it is merely a matter of time before one of the courts, either Luxembourg or Strasbourg, prohibits a Member State from deporting a resident on the basis of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the article dealing with torture and inhumane treatment.</p>
      <p sl="nl">The Dutchman, Robert Hörchner, spent eight months in a Polish prison on the basis of a European arrest warrant. He grew thin – if not to say emaciated – and had scabies all over his body. As it happens, he was acquitted. This Parliament does not want to see this sort of thing happening. Therefore, we are not just asking for better, cleaner, safe prisons, but also for a review of the principle of mutual trust without checks.</p>
      <p sl="nl">How can it be, in this time of debt crisis, that Member States which distrust each other in the area of finances are asking for sanctions, checks and balances and controls but which, when it comes to the deportation of a resident from one country to another, are able to trust each other well enough.</p>
      <p sl="nl">This Parliament therefore asks not only for safe prisons, but also for a maximum period of pre-detention and for judges to be able to refuse a deportation order based on a European arrest warrant and thus avoid sending a resident to another country if the detention facilities are such that Article 3 is violated. I say this, Mr President, because trust is good, but control is better.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why is it even necessary, in this House, in this European Union, to discuss detention conditions? The increasing mobility of our citizens and, in particular, the increased cooperation between the police force and the judicial system, as well as joint measures such as the European arrest warrant, require confidence. This is the confidence that everywhere in the EU, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are being observed. It is confidence in properly functioning legal systems based on the principle of the presumption of innocence, in which a punishment is a punishment, not revenge or humiliation. However, many reports in the last few years and also many judgments of the European Court of Human Rights make it clear that we are still a long way from achieving this.</p>
      <p sl="de">The poor conditions relate to overcrowded prisons, a lack of opportunities for contact, a lack of medical care and many other issues besides. We urgently need common minimum standards for detention conditions and also for pre-trial detention. Long pre-trial detention periods, particularly if it is not in the person’s own Member State, can result in the loss of social contacts and jobs and, due to language barriers, they can entail isolation during detention. Therefore, in particular with regard to minor offences, alternatives to all forms of detention must be given greater consideration. The Commission’s Green Paper cites a number of examples in this regard. However, these need to be applied a great deal more in practice.</p>
      <p sl="de">The conclusion, then, is that minimum standards for detention conditions, a greater use of alternatives and special forms of accommodation for pregnant women and children are essential steps for us to take. The European Parliament has already called for changes to detention conditions in the past. Now, we must finally take specific measures. That is what we are calling for most strongly today and tomorrow.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I am grateful to this Parliament for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Council. Fundamental rights are the basis on which the EU is founded and lie at the heart of everything it does. These rights enshrined in the constitutional traditions of Member States, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights include respect for the life, health and dignity of persons subject to imprisonment.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council is strongly committed to taking action to strengthen mutual trust between the judicial authorities of the Member States. This is key to ensuring the effective implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in the area of freedom, security and justice. Detention conditions are important. They are particularly relevant in the context of ensuring the correct functioning of legal instruments on mutual recognition, such as the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council specifically addressed this issue in the Stockholm programme. It stated that efforts should be undertaken to strengthen mutual trust and render more efficient the principle of mutual recognition in the area of detention. Efforts to promote the exchange of best practices should be pursued and implementation of the European prison rules approved by the Council of Europe should be supported. Issues such as alternatives to imprisonment, pilot projects on detention and best practices in prison management could also be addressed.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Council invited the Commission to reflect further on these issues with the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Lisbon. The Council welcomed the adoption by the Commission on 14 July this year of a Green Paper on strengthening mutual trust in the European judicial area and the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention. It will follow closely the development of the consultation procedure launched by the Commission with this Green Paper.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the Council has not received any proposal to date for either legislative or non-legislative action in the field of detention conditions. Should the Commission decide that action is required and present a proposal, the Council will, of course, examine it closely, given the importance of the issue.</p>
      <p sl="en">It goes without saying that the Union may only adopt legislation where the Treaties provide it with the powers to do so. In the area of detention, the limits of the Union’s competence are set out in the relevant provisions of Article 82 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Detention conditions are not covered by this provision. It is the responsibility of Member States to ensure that detention conditions and prison management respect fundamental rights and, in particular, that they meet agreed international standards, in particular, those of the Council of Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its Green Paper, to which I have already referred, the Commission sets out some of the activities related to the issue of detention conditions and for which it provides support through various financial programmes. The Commission also has a regular dialogue with the Council of Europe on these issues. The Council supports these activities and would welcome other forms of support to Member States in the area of detention conditions and facilities. That said, and given the absence of relevant Treaty provisions, the Council has no further power to take action in the areas mentioned by the honourable Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">Issues such as the setting of common standards on detention conditions, tackling the abuse of pre-trial detention and overcrowding, and the rates of non-nationals detained, all fall outside the scope of action by the Union. The Council is asked about the possibility of providing statistics on the relationship between recourse to the European arrest warrant and pre-trial detentions. Since 2005, the Council has carried out an annual statistical survey among Member States on quantitative data relating to the functioning of the European arrest warrant. However, this is the only statistical data held by the Council.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, detention issues mainly fall under Member States’ responsibility. There are, however, reasons for the European Union to take a closer look.</p>
      <p sl="en">With the Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention, the Commission wanted to find out to what extent detention issues influence mutual trust between Member States and learn more about its impact on the application of the principle of mutual recognition and judicial cooperation within the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">Detention conditions can affect several mutual recognition instruments, such as the European arrest warrant (EAW), the transfer of prisoners, the mutual recognition of alternative sanctions and probation and the European Supervision Order.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision requires the surrender of persons between Member States both in pre-trial and post-trial situations.</p>
      <p sl="en">All Member States must comply with the EU Charter when applying EU law and are subject to the European Convention on Human Rights. However, there are doubts about the way in which standards are upheld across the EU. The Green Paper recalls respect for fundamental rights. In fact, judicial authorities are not obliged to surrender a person if this might breach the person’s fundamental rights because of very poor or unacceptable detention conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Council of Europe plays a key role in monitoring detention conditions. At global level, the 2006 Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture created a new system to prevent ill-treatment of detainees.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Green Paper asked how we could better coordinate the work of these monitoring bodies to avoid duplications.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Framework Decision on transfer of prisoners of 2008 is another example of the challenges we face when it comes to mutual recognition in the area of detention. The Framework Decision establishes a system for transferring convicted prisoners back to the Member State of nationality or habitual residence. Perceived poor detention conditions, or conditions that risk falling below the minimum standards required by the Council of Europe European prison rules, could be an impediment to the transfer of prisoners.</p>
      <p sl="en">Following the road map for strengthening procedural safeguards, the Green Paper recognises that time spent in pre-trial detention varies widely from one Member State to another. In addition, non-nationals seem to have a disadvantage: obtaining bail is often more difficult for them as they are seen as a greater risk as they might leave the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">We asked in the Green Paper whether mutual trust among Member States could be strengthened by creating common minimum standards on two points: first, on the right to review the decision to keep a person in pre-trial detention and, second, on time limits for pre-trial detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The consultation launched by the Green Paper was opened until 20 November. We will now analyse the replies to decide whether any specific action at the European level might be considered.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, I would like to join you in your season’s greetings to the Presidency of the Council, the Commission and all our colleagues, and would like to recall that we have supported enhancing judicial cooperation in criminal matters to establish a true European judicial area and promote quick and effective legal assistance, respecting the fundamental right to defence, procedural guarantees and general human rights principles.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Judicial cooperation in criminal matters must be guided by trust between Member States, founded on the principal of mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions. We know that Member States continue to be responsible for detention conditions and prison management, as the President-in-Office of the Council reminded us, but there cannot be mutual trust without respect for fundamental rights and without efforts to bring the rights of suspects and defendants and procedural rights in criminal proceedings into alignment.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There is still a great deal of variation in detention conditions between Member States. In some Member States, these conditions are below acceptable levels, which not only puts judicial cooperation in criminal matters at European Union level at risk, but also raises concerns about the protection of fundamental rights and the possible violation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
      <p sl="pt">There are significant differences in terms of prison overcrowding, inadequate prison buildings, high numbers in pre-trial detention and the average time spent in pre-trial detention. As Vice-President Kallas has already noted, these circumstances undermine mutual trust and cause problems when it comes to executing the decision taken with regard to the European arrest warrant. There have been several refusals to surrender detainees under the European arrest warrant by different Member States.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We want to call on the European Commission to create common minimum standards. I hope that the Commission can present an initiative, taking into consideration the results of the public consultation launched by the Green Paper referred to by Commissioner Kallas. I call on the Member States, through the President-in-Office of the Council, to urgently take steps that will ensure that the fundamental rights of prisoners, in particular, the rights of vulnerable people, are respected and protected, and to support the application of common minimum detention standards across the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Mr Szpunar, Commissioner, there is one category of prisoners in border countries of the European Union whose conditions are not referred to in the Green Paper, despite their deplorable situation: asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <p sl="es">They are not criminals. Perhaps not all of them meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention because they are not individually persecuted, but they are fleeing wars and are filling up our detention centres in Greece, Italy, Malta and other parts of the Mediterranean. This is because of the length of time it takes to deal with their applications. They can be deprived of their freedom for up to six months because the procedures are at a standstill. Depriving them of their freedom like this must be condemned because it is a shame on us as Europeans. Reacting in this way to humanitarian disasters goes against everything our values represent. We will be aware of the figures and detention time, but what good is it to establish an early warning mechanism for humanitarian disasters if we have not resolved the situation of the refugees we have in the detention camps?</p>
      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, we know that these policies are government policies, but we have the funds for an asylum office that still does not have any duties or a Community mandate.

We should be ashamed that the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture is having to take an interest.</p>
      <p sl="de">Pre-trial detention is meant to be an exceptional measure, but we have Member States where the majority of the prison population is made up of people who have not been convicted of any crime. As Commissioner Kallas has said, non-nationals are given an exceptionally bad deal. My constituent, Andrew Symeou, was held in Greece for almost two years in pre-trial detention, in horrendous conditions before his case finally came to trial, and where a Greek national would almost certainly have been granted bail. He was, be it noted, acquitted.</p>
      <p sl="de">Member States should implement the European supervision order as an alternative to pre-trial detention, but we also need common rules to cut down abuses, on which note I would draw attention to the fact that the Italian President has said that the situation of prisons in Italy is a democratic emergency.

I am of the opinion – and I believe this opinion is very widely shared here in the European Parliament – that we do indeed need to take action at European level to create common standards for these detention conditions, and I believe it is right that the European Commission has submitted a Green Paper in this regard, which also, and in particular, comments on pre-trial detention and indicates ways in which we can create such standards within the bounds of what our Treaties allow.</p>
      <p sl="de">In my view, mutual recognition is not something that we can simply achieve by saying that we accept the fact that there are different procedures and they are simply the way they are, and we send the prisoners back and forth and we send the evidence back and forth and that is how it is. No, that will not do. There are two sides to mutual recognition. It means, on the one hand, of course, that we recognise the procedures of the other Member States, that we try to work together, but, on the other hand, it also means what we have been very clearly calling for for many, many years in the European Parliament and that is the creation of common standards.

That was totally obvious.</p>
      <p sl="en">But in this place, there is an obsessive determination for there to be Europe, Europe and yet more Europe, and Parliament and the Commission then ignored the inconvenient truth that detention conditions are simply not the same in the 27 Member States.

      <p sl="en">For that reason, I commend to you Amendment No 1 and related amendments. Whilst the European arrest warrant continues, nobody should be transferred to a jurisdiction where prison conditions fall below the standard in the home country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Baroness Ludford very eloquently made the point, and I assume she is right, that in some Member States, a majority of people in detention are on remand and, assuming that this is true, so long as this applies, the European arrest warrant should be suspended, and suspended with immediate effect.</p>

Now, our position is that in respect of the detention situation, what we need is not alleviation but, quite on the contrary, restriction. Here, I would like to introduce a new concept to the European Parliament, namely that of self-sufficient, self-sustaining prisons. After all, from a criminological standpoint the significance of prisons lies not only in isolating a criminal from society for a certain amount of time; they should also have a deterrent effect. It is therefore utterly perplexing that the Hungarian state, for example, spends between EUR 800 and EUR 900 a month on every prisoner.</p>
      <p sl="hu">In the meantime, the state spends only a fraction of that amount on kindergarteners or university or secondary school students. What is more, the salary of people on the minimum wage is also a fraction of that amount. The extent of this disproportionality is simply incomprehensible.

All this must obviously come about with full respect for victims and injured parties and without overlooking the principle of the certainty of punishment, which must remain a priority as well as a keystone principle of our judicial systems and democracy itself.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for better European cooperation in the area of justice, it is crucial that the Member States can trust in each other’s justice systems. A shortcoming in detention conditions is one reason for this lack of trust. Even though detention conditions in some Member States might be worse than others, none of the Member States have a clear conscience when it comes to detention conditions. Problems such as overcrowded prisons and ill-treatment of the detainees are to be observed throughout the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is even more alarming are the cases of death and suicide in detention. In the resolution, we asked the Member States to prevent suicides in prison and to carry out in-depth and impartial investigations, systematically in cases where a prisoner dies in prison. Six months after the death of İhsan Gürz in police detention in the Netherlands, there are still several versions of what happened leading up to his death. This makes it difficult for İhsan’s family to have closure. Unfortunately, there are similar cases throughout Europe. Therefore, we are urging independent investigations to be conducted when someone dies in detention.</p>
      <p sl="en">The detention conditions are perhaps the responsibility of Member States, but their shortcomings damage the trust which is needed to achieve judicial cooperation in criminal matters at European level. The lack of trust is preventing Member States from extraditing criminals. What does the Commission intend to do to ensure transparency in every Member State as to what happens in detention and how is the EU intending to ensure the fundamental rights of the detainees?</p>

      <p sl="sv">Mr President, the proposal that we are debating today concerns how we are to strengthen trust between our Member States in the judicial sphere. Part of this concerns the conditions for those who have been detained, conditions which, in some cases unfortunately, are quite appalling. The European Court of Human Rights has, on many occasions, criticised the poor detention conditions and unreasonably long detention periods.</p>
      <p sl="sv">We now need to ensure that the fundamental human rights of detainees are respected and that the conditions in prisons maintain a fairly reasonable standard. We also need to get to grips with the problem of the abuse of pre-trial detention.</p>
      <p sl="sv">The Member States of the EU are now busy developing extensive judicial cooperation. This is based on the principle of the mutual recognition of judges and court rulings. In order for this to work, however, there needs to be trust between the Member States. Ensuring the fundamental rights of detainees must therefore be our top priority.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, what has occurred with the European arrest warrant and prison detention conditions will surely remind many European citizens of other situations in the European Union. Basically, we have this craze to do things half-cocked: unify where it is easy, then fail to harmonise where it is difficult.</p>
      <p sl="pt">I am in favour of the advantages and see the benefits of having a European arrest warrant. I believe it can be important for the victims and for justice to be done. On the other hand, as we have already said many times in this House, and as the Commission knows very well, we cannot continue for much longer, with regard to detention conditions, or procedural conditions in general relating to suspects and those accused of a crime, pushing ahead with the European arrest warrant without also plugging the gaps that exist at European Union level.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The European Commission is now well aware of these. It produced a Green Paper on the differences, the enormous variation, in detention conditions in the European Union. Basically, what we want to know is: what is the Commission now going to do to harmonise these conditions, because without that, it will always be very difficult for us to explain to our citizens what purpose the European arrest warrant serves and why it is that some suspects find themselves in conditions that are at times distressing, degrading and inhumane in some of the countries of the Union that have truly lamentable detention conditions.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, public confidence and international cooperation on criminal matters depend on the quality of national legal systems. Europeans must feel confident that they will enjoy the same standards of protection no matter which European Union country they are in.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Detention conditions have a significant impact on how well the mutual recognition of court judgments operates. Overcrowding in jails and maltreatment of prisoners may undermine confidence, which is vital for judicial cooperation in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I believe that we need to identify good practices, and we need pilot projects on the issue of detention and good practices in administering prisons. Without doubt, our most important task is to establish the most suitable direction to go in with this reform and to what extent having a compulsory instrument at EU level is feasible.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate and thank the Polish Presidency on its important contribution to crucial issues over the past six months.</p>
      <p sl="el">A few days ago, a gun was found in the hands of a Greek prisoner and a massive riot then broke out in the biggest prison in Greece. As a result of this incident – which is why I have raised it – the question of detention conditions in correctional facilities was again at the centre of public debate. Like most European prisons, Greek prisons are overcrowded. For example, the occupancy rate in Greece is approximately 142% and, as my colleagues said, the Member States have an obligation under the European Convention to maintain humane conditions and to comply with minimum specifications, such as those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, the Convention on the Prevention of Torture and, of course, the Recommendation on the European Prison Rules.</p>
      <p sl="el">However, in order for all this to happen and for us to be able to maintain a high level of respect for all detainees, we need to have appropriate infrastructures and, at a time when there are limited funds for creating new correctional facilities, and we all understand this in the midst of the present crisis, I should like to take advantage of the Commission’s presence to ask for an answer to the following question: is it feasible to release funds from various funds for this purpose, to create new correctional facilities in the Member States?</p>

Indeed, the court processing the warrant cannot refuse to extradite on the ground of insufficient evidence. It can refuse only on the grounds of one of the five legal bars to extradition. Some people extradited on the warrant have to spend months in custody awaiting trial.</p>

The procedural requirements for holding suspects in remand, the maximum length of their detention and also the conditions in which they are held and their health care should be harmonised on the basis of EU standards in such a way as to eliminate differences between Member States in terms of detention conditions.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by George Sabin Cutaş, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the interim report on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part, amending the agreement in order to extend the provisions of the agreement to bilateral trade in textiles, taking account of the expiry of the bilateral textiles agreement (16384/1/2010 – C7-0097/2011 – 2010/0323(NLE)) (A7-0427/2011).</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the European Parliament has been asked to give its consent to a Protocol amending the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Uzbekistan so that the textile trade can benefit from an appropriate legal framework.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is missing at the moment as textiles were a sensitive issue in the negotiations during the 1990s for the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements with the countries of the former Soviet Union. The protocol being discussed wishes to include textiles in this agreement so that legal certainty is guaranteed for European Union exporters.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, over and above this general context, there is still a serious problem which the European Parliament cannot fail to address: accusations that forced child labour is used in the cotton fields in Uzbekistan. This is the main reason why, following the debates in the Commission, we decided to draft this interim report.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Uzbekistan is the world’s fifth largest producer of cotton and its third biggest cotton exporter. According to several reports from the Initiative Group of Human Rights Defenders of Uzbekistan, produced in partnership with the International Forum for Civil Rights, as well as from the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights and the NGO Anti-Slavery International, the political and economic systems in Uzbekistan are controlled by the state. Cotton is produced on private farms, but the harvested cotton must be handed over to state-owned firms for a price dictated by the State.</p>
      <p sl="ro">According to the same reports, government employees mobilise children as a cheap source of labour during the cotton harvest. The estimates range from 200 000 to 2 million children aged 9-15 years old. The State dictates the quotas for cotton, which must be fulfilled. Schools are obliged to send children out into the cotton fields. Administrative employees and teachers who refuse to comply risk losing their jobs. The families of children who refuse to work are pressurised by the police and the prosecution service. The authorities threaten to withhold pensions and social benefits, to cut off electricity, gas and water supplies and even to arrest, imprison and charge members of non-compliant families. Many schools, particularly those in agricultural regions, are closed from September until November or December. As a consequence, the children involved miss two to three months of school every year.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The Uzbek Government denies that these problems exist and states that this is a family farm activity. Continued allegations of forced child labour obliged the Uzbek Government to ratify in 2008 the two ILO conventions on child labour, after which it approved the National Action Plan to implement them.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Over the years, many international organisations such as the UN or ILO have expressed concerns regarding the use of forced child labour in Uzbekistan. However, the Uzbek Government does not allow independent international observers in the country during the harvest season to verify the implementation of the ILO conventions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">As rapporteur, I tried to meet all the parties involved in this agreement. I regret that it was not possible to have an exchange of views in the Committee on International Trade with Uzbekistan’s ambassador to the EU, even though he has been repeatedly invited. I think that he could have portrayed to us the situation in his country. Unfortunately, even the bilateral meeting we managed to have with the ambassador was not enlightening.</p>
      <p sl="ro">On the other hand, I would like to thank my colleagues because they showed that they were receptive to the concerns expressed by the European Parliament, and I thank them for their valuable contribution to the final version.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that we have managed to achieve a balanced report, through which we call on the Council to support the request submitted by the ILO to Uzbekistan to accept a high-level tripartite observer mission, enjoying full freedom of movement, in order to assess the implementation of the ILO conventions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to mention the petition launched by the Anti-Slavery organisation, requesting trade preferences to be halted. Last week, I had the opportunity to meet some students from Eastbourne who came to the European Parliament along with members from Anti-Slavery to ask the European Union to protect children’s rights. I must tell you, Mr President, that once this debate is over, I will be handing in a petition making this request containing 13 379 signatures.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on International Trade and its rapporteur, Mr Cutaş, for this interim report.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, the object of this consent procedure is an amendment to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Uzbekistan concerning trade in textiles. Its only objective is to ensure that textile exports from the EU to Uzbekistan would get most-favoured-nation treatment. So let us keep clearly in mind that we are talking about an agreement that gives legal certainty to the EU and does not grant any benefits to Uzbekistan itself.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is well aware of the problem of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan and fully shares Parliament’s concerns in this respect. We have already been monitoring for quite some time Uzbekistan’s compliance with its obligations in the field of child labour under the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the relevant United Nations conventions. The EU regularly relays concerns about forced child labour in the country in its political dialogue with Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The country has taken some steps to address the problem, notably by ratifying two ILO conventions concerning child labour and by setting up a national legislative framework against forced labour and child labour. However, what matters is not only the ratification but the actual implementation of these conventions. In this respect, it is a fact that the use of child labour in the cotton sector in Uzbekistan is still an issue of concern.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore the Commission will, in close cooperation with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, continue to monitor the situation and actively scale up its efforts to urge the Uzbek Government to take the necessary steps to fully implement the ILO conventions.</p>
      <p sl="en">We undertook a mission to Uzbekistan in November 2011. The EU team enjoyed the full cooperation of the Uzbek authorities and discussions with international organisations confirmed some positive changes in certain regions during this year’s harvest.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Uzbek authorities showed new openness to discuss the issue and there have been some positive signs about cooperation with the ILO. The Uzbek side emphasised that the problem can only be handled by means of a gradual approach, notably by restructuring and diversifying the agricultural sector so as to reduce dependency on the cotton sector.</p>
      <p sl="en">We fully agree with Parliament – and this has been our message to the Uzbek authorities – that the best way to have a clear and accurate picture of the situation would be to allow the ILO to undertake a mission to the country.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is open to make the necessary arrangements with Parliament to jointly monitor the situation in cooperation with the relevant international institutions and to regularly assess the situation with a view to resuming this consent procedure as soon as reasonably possible. While we fully understand the justified human rights concerns, we are of the view that an agreement that serves only the EU deserves to receive the consent of the European Parliament in a timely manner.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that ever since 1990, there has been a bilateral agreement still to be formalised by this Parliament, but how is it possible to approve a protocol on the trade in textiles when there remain the alarming doubts so clearly expressed by Mr Cutaş?</p>
      <p sl="it">In the report by the rapporteur of the Committee on International Trade and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, all the various political groups together reached a compromise to express with a single voice our condemnation of forced child labour and our call for the international control bodies, such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to be respected, since they have the right to inspect, free from all constraints and threats.</p>
      <p sl="it">The fact that the ambassador has provided no answers and that the Commission itself, after so many years have passed, is incapable of providing concrete, clear and certain answers, means the doubts that have caused concern in our debate in recent weeks still persist.</p>
      <p sl="it">We all know that the volume of trade in textiles between our countries represents a residual percentage. Nonetheless, tomorrow’s vote is symbolic, since it will send out a signal not only to Uzbekistan, but to all our commercial partners in central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="it">International trade is a foreign policy instrument, a guarantor of respect for equitable and shared rules, which are necessary for an orderly and competitive market capable of developing worldwide economic relations, but also of respecting human rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">Parliament does not presume to condemn a country, but wishes, and has the duty, to demand the temporary suspension of approval of the trade protocol until the Uzbek Government allows international observers to enter the country. Once this agreement has been temporarily suspended, we must also address the issue of what our position should be towards any strategic and trade agreement with countries in which there is no certainty of respect for the most fundamental human rights.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, Baroness Ashton stated that human rights should henceforth run as a silver thread throughout all of our external actions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Union is one of the main trading partners of Uzbekistan and a major importer of cotton. In view of conditions during the cotton harvest, Parliament is duty-bound to shoulder its moral responsibility and refuse to consent to this agreement as long as Uzbekistan continues to deny access to the independent mission of the International Labour Organisation, and until that mission confirms that reforms have been implemented, bringing an end to forced child labour.</p>
      <p sl="fr">For the first time ever, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament can use its new powers and refuse to ratify a trade agreement in the name of human rights. Our action is therefore consistent with the values we defend, and conforms to what is being demanded by NGOs, trade unions and textile retailers’ groups, who are calling for ethical production. The ball is now in the Commission’s court, and it should withdraw the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for Uzbekistan.</p>

      <p sl="en">It seems that we are all on the same page on this issue. The evidence that has come from a variety of organisations suggests that as many as 200 000 children are used to harvest the cotton in Uzbekistan. Parents and teachers are forced to comply or risk losing their jobs. The police and the prosecution service pressurise families. Families are threatened with the loss of electricity, or loss of social security. There is no question that forced child labour is taking place in Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">So, to accept this proposal would not be in line with our principle of coherence between trade policy and human rights. It would not be in line with our commitments to the international rights of the child, and it would not be in line with our strong line on tackling corruption.</p>
      <p sl="en">As others have said, we need clear, independent monitoring from the ILO and clear evidence from the Uzbekistan authorities that serious efforts are being made to tackle forced child labour before there can be any question of this issue coming back on our agenda.</p>
      <p sl="en">I agree with the previous speaker as well that if nothing is done, we also have to look at the GSP+ situation for Uzbekistan. As the Commissioner rightly acknowledges, it is not enough simply to pass and simply to ratify two ILO Conventions. They must be implemented.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, I shall begin with a poem by an Uzbek poet, Jogdor Obid (I translate from the English): ‘Little hands, little slaves dream of warm and sunny days, but suffer from coughs and tremble as they walk. Little hands and little slaves, children’s thoughts, dreams of tenderness, but it all ends up dead and buried’. This is the testimony of Jogdor Obid, describing cotton-picking by children in Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p sl="it">This took place in the period of the Soviet Union. Some things have changed, others have not. For example, the power structure has not changed: the Uzbek President today is the same one who, in 1991, was at the head of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Uzbekistan. Other things have changed: the situation of children in the cotton fields is worse, much worse. In other interviews, Jogdor Obid speaks of seven-year-olds who are slaves, being bought and sold in Uzbekistan to harvest cotton.</p>
      <p sl="it">This is an intolerable situation: our demands are the same as those already mentioned: access for International Labour Organisation (ILO) inspectors; for Uzbekistan to act in accordance with the values of human rights, which are, in fact, included in the country’s constitution; for the Commission to propose a traceability mechanism for the cotton harvested, free from the trade in children and their condition as slaves; again for the Commission, also on the basis of the ILO findings, possibly to decide the suspension of the Generalised System of Privileges (GSP) for Uzbekistan. We have done this with the Sri Lanka GSP+, and we could think of doing the same with Uzbekistan.</p>
      <p sl="it">Naturally, there will be no agreement on this protocol by the European Parliament, which can rely on its new Lisbon powers; at stake are the ever-stricter values of the European Union, not least as concerns our international trade policy.</p>

      <p sl="en">In relation to the textiles, there is clear evidence of state-sanctioned, systematic and widespread forced labour in the Uzbek cotton fields. Schools are being closed during the harvest period and thousands upon thousands of school children are being forced to work in the fields collecting cotton.

Despite that and despite the condemnations, including by the EU, of the conditions in the cotton fields of Uzbekistan, the reality is that the government of Uzbekistan still benefits from reduced tariffs under GSP.</p>
      <p sl="en">Again and again in this House, the gulf between words and actions is great. That gulf should be closed here. The Uzbek Government’s blanket denials are simply not credible, given the multitude of independent reports and the fact that the government refuses to allow access to the ILO.</p>
      <p sl="en">The attempts by the right wing in this Parliament to water down the report are outrageous in my opinion. They should answer to a 14-year old boy from Uzbekistan who said: ‘We’re really afraid of getting expelled from school. Every September 2, the first day of school, the Director warns us that if we don’t go out to pick cotton, we might as well not come back to school. The school administration does everything to create the impression that the schoolchildren themselves are the ones who have decided to go out to the cotton fields. But just try to ‘voluntarily’ not go out to the harvest! We’re all forced to obey this unwritten law’.</p>
      <p sl="en">No consent should be given to this agreement and there must be no ambiguity about that. Consent can only be considered after the ILO has been allowed access and after the practice of forced child labour has been ended.</p>

If the Commission really believes that what we debate in Parliament counts for something, it should take action tomorrow, not with a report, or a threat, or a proposal for a measure.</p>
      <p sl="it">If it is true, and here the whole House is saying the same thing, from left to right – that thousands of children are forcibly sent to work in the cotton fields (and I think that the evidence now proves that it is so), then we vote in favour of this report. Yet if, tomorrow morning, no practical action against the government of Uzbekistan is taken by the European Commission, it will mean that we have lost, and we have wasted our time here tonight, as well as helping to destroy the credibility of Parliament, the Commission and the European institutions, and that we have several hundred thousand children on our consciences. Children who, if the debate continues so slowly, will continue next year to do what they have been forced to do for decades.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the terrible way that large parts of the cotton harvest are gathered in Uzbekistan has been mentioned many times. As a father of two children, I would find it utterly horrific if my children experienced something similar to what happens to many children in Uzbekistan. However, we all know – and we mention this in our report – that we cannot change everything overnight. Nevertheless, I think that it is legitimate for us as the European Parliament – and fortunately the Commission is in agreement with us here – to demand that something has to change, at least in terms of the approach. What we are demanding, namely, that the International Labour Organisation is genuinely able to move around freely in the country and get a picture of the situation first hand so that we are not always relying on the unconfirmed reports of various non-governmental organisations, but will actually get an objective picture of how things stand, is completely reasonable.</p>
      <p sl="de">We all ought to know that this will be a gradual process. We should not hide behind child labour. Instead, I hope that the European Commission will actually consider how we can help the Uzbek people to overcome this situation. We all know that, if this is a process that has to take its course, then we ought to consider how we can provide very practical assistance to the Uzbek Government and the Uzbek people to increase their use of technology in this regard. That means that it cannot be a solution to completely stop all trade, because if they cannot sell us any more cotton, they will not have any money to invest in technology in order to be able to eradicate child labour. Instead, I would like to see the Commission presenting us with a road map today for how, if the Uzbeks finally allow ILO observers into the country, we can find a realistic way in the coming years, together with the Uzbeks, to help them to improve this situation step by step over the next few years, following a realistic timetable. We should not simply make demands; in this case, we should also make a straightforward and acceptable offer of help.</p>

Given the human rights situation, especially forced child labour, I consider it impossible for us to consent to the amendment to the partnership agreement with Uzbekistan unless we first ensure that important changes will be made to that country’s policy and, more importantly, that a stop will be put to forced child labour. The practices applied in that country are mediaeval and the government continues to deny that there is a problem.</p>
      <p sl="el">Observers from the International Labour Organisation must be allowed in and must have free access, so that a proper assessment can be made. It is not enough for Uzbekistan to sign agreements under international pressure; it must also apply them. How can children be taken out of school for three months and be sent to harvest cotton and their parents threatened with serious penalties if they refuse? The Union cannot turn a blind eye yet again and apply double standards to its practices, on the off-chance that a few European textile companies might benefit.</p>

With four other friends, she left home at 5.30 in the morning to make a trip to our Parliament with a petition for the President. Jordan went on, ‘I am here to ask the European politicians what they are going to do to stop it’. Well, what are we going to do?</p>
      <p sl="en">This is something that every MEP should be asking. As the Uzbek cotton harvest ends, there are again reports of children as young as eight being forced to work long hours in the cotton fields. The Khorezm region mobilised 170 000 schoolchildren during the harvest. Eight college directors were reportedly beaten to coerce them to pick cotton.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Parliament must send a strong message to Uzbekistan that this practice must cease. Uzbekistan has made no credible efforts to end this practice. It does not cooperate with the ILO, despite signing relevant conventions, and it failed to invite ILO observers once again during this harvest. In the Committee on International Trade, we bent over backwards to give the government a hearing but they failed to send anyone to speak to MEPs.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is not acceptable and it cannot be business as usual. We now need to send a strong message.

      <p sl="lv">Mr President, Uzbekistan, like the rest of the Central Asian countries, is a resource-rich and important partner of the European Union. It is the fifth largest cotton manufacturer and the third largest cotton exporter in the world. The European Union is the largest importer of Uzbek cotton in the world. These facts provide us with the opportunity and the duty to positively influence the development of Uzbekistan and bilateral cooperation, to promote progress both in the field of economics and in human rights. However, excessively didactic rhetoric, which may achieve exactly the opposite, should be avoided. The citizens of Uzbekistan have a positive attitude towards the European Union, and in order to strengthen cooperation, I believe, the activities of the delegation of the European Union in Tashkent will be important. The work on the standpoint of Parliament in relation to the protocol was not easy, especially because of existing concerns in the field of human rights. Both in the report and in the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, strong condemnation of any forced labour was expressed. After examining the facts, I have come to two main conclusions. Firstly, Uzbekistan has to ensure that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) may operate freely in the country. At the same time, we must take into account that Uzbekistan has already taken significant strides towards resolving the problems by ratifying 13 ILO conventions and most of the UN conventions on human rights, and these principles have been incorporated in the Uzbek constitution. Forced child labour has been made a criminal offence. Secondly, it is essential to ensure that the agricultural sector is modernised. It is therefore important to sign the protocol on trade in textiles with Uzbekistan, which should be done without undue delay as soon as the International Labour Organisation confirms that certain reforms have been implemented and forced labour has been effectively eradicated.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, I welcome the rapporteur’s position that the agreement with Uzbekistan on trade in textile products should not be based purely on economic considerations. Tashkent denies that child labour is being used in the country, but its unwillingness to give access to representatives from the International Labour Organisation and other observers would suggest otherwise. The European Union must use all of its influence to change the situation. The country’s government is incapable of dealing with agriculture, halting the destruction of nature and the wasting of water. Whether we like it or not, companies from EU Member States that buy as much as a quarter of the country’s cotton are supporting this failing system.</p>
      <p sl="lt">Half in jest half in earnest, I would propose that we should perhaps demand that all EU companies buying cotton from Uzbekistan mark their products ‘possibly manufactured using child labour’. Maybe this would help speed up change in the country?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was exactly 20 years ago that the Central Asian states received their national independence as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Emerging from a dictatorship, the development of democratic structures and the rule of law in these states remains a constant challenge. Nevertheless, on account of their rich deposits of mineral resources and raw materials, these states are important trading partners for the EU and its Member States. It is therefore only logical to regulate the EU’s relations with these states within the framework of partnership and cooperation agreements. Partnership and cooperation agreements should facilitate cooperation and lead to the two parties trading as partners, but not to unilateral stigmatisation.</p>
      <p sl="de">Child labour, and particularly forced child labour, is an evil that, unfortunately, is prevalent in many countries of this world and must be combated. However, I would ask you to consider the fact that in many European regions dominated by agriculture, it was common for the school holidays to be extended for the children during harvest time in order to allow children from farming families to help out with the harvest, which is something that no one would describe as forced labour today. However, should there be indications that forced child labour is being used in the cotton harvest in Uzbekistan, then the appropriate action must be taken.</p>
      <p sl="de">The same action must then be taken for all other states in which there is still child labour, even for those states where we are pursuing economic interests on a completely different scale, like India or China. We must not apply double standards here.</p>

Many contract hepatitis from insanitary conditions, and there have even been reports of police throwing stones at children who were not picking cotton because they were sick.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Uzbekistan is, or rather should be, strategically important to the European Union. Not just Uzbekistan, but essentially the entire region of Central Asia. There are three aspects that must definitely be taken into account if an agreement is concluded between the European Union and Uzbekistan. Firstly, the more sources of supply the European Union has the better. We must obviously not be vulnerable due to a sole dependency on Chinese cotton exports, and it is therefore good for the European Union to have ties with Uzbekistan which is, as far as I know, the world’s third biggest cotton exporter. However, from a human rights standpoint, Uzbekistan definitely needs to make progress, and in respect of child labour, the European Union must make no concessions whatsoever.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I want to thank the honourable Members for this very serious and important debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me focus on the course to suspend the generalised system of preferences (GSP preferences). On behalf of the Commission, I take note of the references made to the generalised system of preferences of which Uzbekistan is currently a beneficiary. The GSP is an incentive-based tool to support development. Its aim is to help developing countries to advance towards a better respect of international conventions on human and labour rights as well as to lock in essential reforms in these fields.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Last but not least, I am, of course, in favour of adopting a constructive approach. However, as long as there is no dialogue and no discussion partner, I believe, Commissioner, that you must give very serious consideration to the European Union initiating an inquiry into the temporary withdrawal of the Generalised System of Preferences rights, not to mention that we have a fairly large political influence, because European Union exports to Uzbekistan amount to no more than 0.5% of the total, and this is why I believe that we can have a fairly large influence on our partners.</p>

      <p sl="de">Tomorrow, the European Parliament will debate the partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part. The technical aspect that needs to be discussed here is clear. Incorporating provisions on trading in textiles into the partnership and cooperation agreement is intended, above all, to guarantee more security for the European economy. As Uzbekistan does not belong to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in the event of arbitrary changes to duties or other non-tariff barriers to trade on the part of Uzbekistan, there would be little that could be done from a legal point of view. In light of this, extending the partnership and cooperation agreement to cover trade in textiles is a logical step. The fact that Uzbekistan has been facing accusations of forced child labour for a long time is something that causes me a great deal more concern, however. These accusations need to be put to rest once and for all. International observers, for example, from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), must investigate the current state of affairs in the country and provide clarification on this matter. Should these fears be confirmed, the EU must not support this situation by extending its trade. Forced child labour and the worst kinds of child labour must be combated globally. I therefore support the interim report that has been tabled by the rapporteur with the support of all the groups, which ties approval of the amendment to the partnership and cooperation agreement to clear conditions.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this is about an oral question and a motion for a resolution.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I would say about both the oral question and the joint motion for a resolution is that they put forward two basic propositions. Firstly, that the restrictions for Romanian and Bulgarian workers on the European labour market should be lifted, as there is no real economic reason to keep them in place, and I quote here from a fresh report from the Commission. Secondly, the oral question and the motion for a resolution are asking for the states that want to exercise their right to extend the barriers to provide hard economic data in support of their request.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since this whole debate was sometimes misunderstood or misrepresented, I have to state what the question and the motion for a resolution are not about.</p>
      <p sl="en">Firstly, they are not about changing Treaties or any other kind of legislation. They only ask for legislation to be implemented with good reason and not implemented at all when there is no reason.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, the question and the motion are not about encouraging vagueness. On the contrary, they propose more transparency, which is to say that from now on, Member States should not be able to limit the fundamental rights of fellow European citizens by simply invoking a vague formula – by ticking a box. This sort of behaviour is neither rational nor legal: it is pure imposition.</p>
      <p sl="en">For those who wondered whether Romanians and Bulgarians could really not wait for another two years, the answer is no. When the issue is your rights, sometimes even a day can be too long.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the question and the motion push for full European consistency. I therefore have to ask: why maintain an arrangement that allows goods and capital to move freely towards East European Member States while stopping East European citizens taking up jobs in Western European countries?</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the right to live and work in another country of the Union is one of the fundamental freedoms of the European Union, and yet Romanian and Bulgarian workers face total or partial restrictions on their fundamental right of freedom of movement.</p>
      <p sl="en">Transitional measures constitute a derogation from a fundamental freedom. Those transitional measures are counter-productive in terms of combating forced self-employment, undeclared work and irregular employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">Eleven Member States still maintain partial or total restrictions, but this Parliament still does not know how many of those have requested the extension of the transitional measures for the next two years. Can the Commission tell us how many requests it has received? Can the Commission also explain on what basis its judgment is going to be produced?</p>
      <p sl="en">At a time when racism, xenophobia and social conflict are increasing, it is of the utmost importance to guarantee social cohesion in the European Union through effective integration policies promoting equal treatment, decent working conditions and social protection, and not to use derogations from fundamental freedoms as a political weapon.</p>
      <p sl="en">Bulgarian and Romanian citizens have the right to enjoy equal treatment just like other European citizens. This is also a way of ensuring fair competition between businesses and preventing any social and economic dumping. Workers’ mobility in the European Union should never be considered a threat to the internal labour market. Therefore, our political groups support the opinion that all these transitional measures should be abolished.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the free movement of workers is one of the fundamental freedoms, together with the free movement of goods, services and capital. It is a pillar of the single market and, for 50 years, it has contributed to making European integration a success. I know that the free movement of workers and the lifting of the restrictions in place are of significant importance to you and it is also important for the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">As you know, the transitional arrangements aim at allowing Member States to prepare gradually for the full application of EU law on the free movement of workers. The transitional arrangements were agreed for a maximum period of seven years, in three phases. Each phase requires more and stronger justification from Member States if they want to maintain the restriction to the free movement of workers. We are approaching the third and final phase of these seven years.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2007, ten of the 25 other Member States opened their labour markets for Bulgarian and Romanian workers immediately. By now, this number has increased for Bulgarian workers to 15, and for Romanian workers to 14 Member States. Even in the Member States that still apply restrictions, several apply less strict conditions or simplified procedures in comparison to the conditions and procedures that applied to Bulgarian and Romanian workers prior to joining the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">According to the transitional arrangements, a Member State that currently still restricts the free movement of workers can only continue to do so for the final two years of the transitional period if it notifies the Commission before 1 January 2012 of a serious disturbance of its labour market, or a threat thereof. This restriction can last until 31 December 2013 at the very latest.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, the transitional arrangements do not define what a serious disturbance of the labour market, or the threat thereof, is. As labour markets across the EU vary widely between Member States, each Member State will therefore have to assess itself whether it undergoes, or is threatened by, a serious labour market disturbance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission cannot lay down criteria that Member States would have to use. The Commission has made it clear though, that it expects any Member State that wishes to extend restrictions on labour market access to explain why it considers it is undergoing or is threatened by a serious labour market disturbance and to provide justification with data and convincing, pertinent arguments when notifying the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Commission stated in the report adopted on 11 November on the functioning of the transitional arrangements, it expects more than a simple reference to the unemployment rate. What is, however, important to remember is that the transitional arrangements do not stipulate that the serious labour market disturbance, or the threat thereof, must be caused by an influx of Romanian and Bulgarian workers.</p>
      <p sl="en">What is also important to note is that a Member State only needs to send a notification within the deadline, without needing the Commission’s assent to the notification. In that case, national law on labour market access will continue to apply after 31 December 2011. Concerning the disclosure of a letter of notification, the Commission must, in accordance with existing procedures, consult in respect of each such request the Member State from where the notification originates.</p>
      <p sl="en">In any case, the Commission will check whether the notifications were sent within the deadline, which means before 1 January 2012. If not, EU law on free movement of workers will apply fully.</p>
      <p sl="en">At the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council earlier this month, I encouraged governments to consider with great care, not only in light of the situation of the labour market, but also on the basis of the facts contained in the Commission’s report, whether it is necessary to maintain restrictions on the labour market access of Bulgarian and Romanian workers. I reminded Member States to keep in mind that the transitional arrangements aim at allowing Member States to prepare gradually for the full application of EU law on free movement of workers and not at delaying its application until the very end of the transitional period.</p>
      <p sl="en">Free movement of workers is one of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the EU Treaty and a strong symbol for all European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Apart from the right to work itself, working and living conditions are an important aspect here. Bulgarian and Romanian workers who have been admitted to work in a Member State – even in ones that still apply restrictions – benefit fully from the provisions of EU law on free movement of workers that grant the right to equal treatment with nationals as regards conditions of employment and work, including pay. The labour market and social situation has been analysed in the Commission report as well as in a specific chapter of the Employment and Social Developments in Europe review, a report to be adopted and presented on 15 December.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, as regards, ‘irregular’ Bulgarian and Romanian workers, the Commission regrets that there is no detailed information or data about their number or social situation, which is precisely due to the hidden character of their presence in other Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In its 2008 and 2011 reports on the functioning of transitional arrangements of Bulgarian and Romanian workers, the Commission has already underlined that the restrictions to free movement of workers do not necessarily have the expected impact of protecting the national labour markets. In some cases, the restrictions can even exacerbate the incidence of undeclared work, leading to undesired social consequences both for undeclared workers and the regular labour force.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will continue to develop and promote, in relation with the Member States, specific activities to fight undeclared work.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the Posting of Workers Directive fully applies to Bulgarian and Romanian workers who are posted. It defines the core of mandatory working conditions to be respected in the host country by companies posting workers temporarily to that country, in particular, with respect to maximum work periods and minimum rest periods; minimum paid annual holidays; the minimum rates of pay, and health and safety at work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The directive thus provides for a significant level of protection of posted workers and avoids that working conditions in the host country are undermined as an effect of competition.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission is currently preparing a legislative proposal which will aim to improve and reinforce the implementation, application and enforcement in practice of the Posting of Workers Directive. It will include measures to prevent and sanction any abuse and circumvention of the applicable rules. The adoption of the proposal is foreseen for February 2012. The incoming Danish Presidency will immediately start negotiations on this proposal.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, new developments in the status of mobile workers from Romania and Bulgaria emerge every day that goes by. So far, the Netherlands and the UK have decided, for no reason, to extend these restrictions. I should emphasise that this measure has been taken at a time when the old Member States have an ageing population and a young workforce is needed so as to have someone to pay us our pensions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I hope that the other Member States which have not yet announced their decision on extending the restrictions will follow the example of Germany, which has shown confidence in the professionalism of Romanian workers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, I wonder how some governments can use the argument of disturbances in the labour market when even employers and SMEs in their own country are asking for the restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian workers to be lifted. I feel that it is precisely the refusal of these governments to allow supply to meet demand that is causing imbalances in the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to express again my regret that there are Member States which prefer to retain these restrictions, while inventing someone to blame and excuses to make to their own electorate for the economic situation which a section of the population are in.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to thank the authors of the questions and the Commissioner for his statement. The German Social Democrats are also in favour of mobility and the free movement of workers on the European labour market. That is an important and key fundamental freedom. Although the facts dispel all fears, the German conservative-liberal Government is also no doubt planning to refuse to allow all workers to fully exercise this fundamental right. I find that very disappointing when I look at other European policy areas.</p>
      <p sl="de">In contrast to other countries, Germany has not made use of the transitional periods in order to make the German labour market fit for Europe. Time and again in Germany, I receive reports from colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria informing me of the methods being used in Germany. I can tell you that these are almost always bordering on illegal or are actually illegal. A further extension and a further denial of this fundamental right will only serve to promote fraud, undeclared employment and ostensible self-employment. It is not the influx of workers from Bulgaria and Romania that creates problems but the lack of fair conditions on the labour market. For us in Germany, these include the lack of a minimum wage and too little control of undeclared employment and combating of ostensible self-employment. Therefore, we must also put the principle of equal pay and equal working conditions for equal work in the same place into practice and introduce it in a uniform way at European level. Then, all workers within Europe will also be able to move around to work with dignity.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I have supported and do support European integration. I have supported and worked constantly for Romania’s integration into the European Union because I see the EU as one family, created to safeguard its citizens’ wellbeing, a place where everyone has the same rights, and discrimination of any kind is unacceptable. However, the reality is different from my vision of Europe. In a Union which is based on the freedom of movement, Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are being treated like second-class citizens.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Since our accession to the European Union and up until now, we have accepted the restrictions which some Member States have imposed on us, citing economic arguments which have very often had mainly political considerations underlying them. However, starting from 2012, the restrictions may be extended only if there are severe disturbances in these countries’ labour markets. In actual fact, the statistics made available by the European Commission last month are clear, indicating that Romanian and Bulgarian workers have had a beneficial influence on the economy of those countries. This means that there is no justification for maintaining the restrictions out of fear of an alleged ‘disturbing influence’ caused by the presence of Romanian and Bulgarian workers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">In these circumstances, in order to prevent Member States making decisions once again on the basis of political and populist considerations, I call on the European Commission to propose clear, transparent criteria for evaluating applications to extend or reintroduce the restrictive measures.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I welcome the announcement from the Belgian prime minister about lifting the restrictions on Romanian workers. I hope that it will be implemented and that this step will be followed immediately by all the other Member States which are still restricting access for Romanian and Bulgarian workers.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Workers’ mobility within the EU must no longer be regarded as a threat to internal labour markets, with it being the Commission’s obligation to monitor compliance with this principle.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, Commissioner, five years ago, Bulgaria and Romania became members of our Union. In their Accession Treaties, it states that all other Member States must immediately or gradually open up their labour markets to Romanian and Bulgarian workers. The final transition period is about to start, a period in which only those countries which can prove a serious disruption to their labour market can apply transitional measures.</p>
      <p sl="nl">There is now also a report – for which we are grateful to you – which suggests that those countries which did not introduce transitional measures have, in fact, benefited and that transitional measures have mainly negative effects. There is every reason, therefore, for all Member States to open up their labour markets completely to Bulgarian and Romanian workers.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Unfortunately, a number of countries have announced that they do wish to impose restrictive measures, with the Netherlands being the most enthusiastic proponent of this ‘worst practice’. If Mr Kamp, Minister for Social Affairs, has his way, not a single Bulgarian or Romanian will be able to enter the Netherlands. This has nothing to do with the facts. Not only is it completely ridiculous that it is precisely in the Netherlands, one of the richest EU countries with the lowest unemployment rate, that it is being claimed that the labour market might be disrupted, but there are also all kinds of studies – in the Netherlands as well – that indicate that these measures encourage exploitation.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Transitional measures mean sentencing thousands of EU citizens to exploitation, poor working conditions, fictitious self-employment and low pay. Transitional measures also mean that thousands of employers are unable to recruit the workers that they consider best suited to the work in their company. Transitional measures mean, as far as I am concerned, a violation of the right to freedom of movement and an infringement of the Accession Treaties if a country is unable to prove any serious disruption.</p>
      <p sl="nl">You, Commissioner, are the Guardian of the Treaties. I expect you to perform this role not merely in letter but also in spirit. Therefore, as soon as you receive the notification from the Netherlands, I expect you to put the examination and the facts to one side and say: ‘Dear Mr Kamp, enough of this ridiculous fairy tale’. If you do not do this, then the Accession Treaties will not be worth the paper they are printed on. The Netherlands is constantly reminding Romania and Bulgaria of their obligations, and now it is failing in its own obligation under the Treaties that it itself ratified.</p>
      <p sl="nl">If you let the Netherlands get away with this, then you are actually saying that domestic policy considerations come before the freedom of movement of workers. You are actually saying that the richer, old Member States can interpret the Treaties as it suits them, even if they then cause harm to their own workers and thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Madam President, it is not acceptable that Bulgarian and Romanian citizens continue to be discriminated against by certain European Union Member States in their access to the respective labour markets and, accordingly, we insist that it is insufficient to affirm that free movement of workers is a fundamental right of the European Union. It is necessary to guarantee that all are assured equal rights, that the directives of the European Union and economic policies create the jobs required for all, and that they guarantee the necessary socio-economic mechanisms to avoid any kind of social dumping.</p>
      <p sl="pt">Accordingly, it is time to end restrictions on access to the respective labour markets for Romanian and Bulgarian citizens given that, in many cases, these restrictions serve as cover for forced self-employment, undeclared work and irregular employment, which puts the rights of all workers at risk, including workers of the countries hosting the Bulgarian and Romanian citizens.</p>
      <p sl="pt">We know that the promotion of neoliberal policies is aggravating unemployment, precarious and badly paid work, and undeclared work, and hence social dumping is proliferating, the exploitation of workers is intensifying and a cultural melting pot is created that is conducive to xenophobia and racism. That is why we insist on the need for progressive economic and social policies and also on a committed fight against all discrimination in defence of equal rights and opportunities and with respect for the dignity of workers.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the end of this year will see completion of the second phase of the transitional period for Romania and Bulgaria, during which transitional restrictions on employment in certain EU countries apply to both countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">If the countries applying these restrictions wish to continue restricting the employment of citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, they will have to provide proof that opening their labour markets could cause serious problems on those markets. In terms of objectivising this process, it would be right and proper for the Commission to formulate the conditions that it would regard as acceptable from the perspective of continuing employment restrictions against citizens from other Member States. The correct behaviour of Member States in applying these sensitive restrictions should be subject to qualified assessment and supervision by the political bodies of the Union, in order to prevent inappropriate behaviour and the development of unnecessary disputes between EU countries.</p>
      <p sl="sk">A restriction on worker mobility without genuinely serious reasons is an unfortunate solution, as it leads to a growth in undeclared employment, which does not produce legitimate deductions for the pension or taxation system in the country where the undeclared worker is employed. It would be immoral to tolerate such a situation without proper justification, and shameful to a system that allows it.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the end of this year is the crucial point when we all can show if we are truly committed to the idea of more Europe and a stronger Europe through more integration.</p>
      <p sl="en">The 11 Member States that still impose this legally correct mechanism to protect their labour markets could show in reality – and not only in words – if they are open to the idea of a truly free and functioning single market where barriers for workers do not exist and every citizen can exercise his or her right to work in the entire Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">All the studies and reports recently released by the Commission show no solid evidence of a direct link between the magnitude of labour flows from the two EU Member States and the transitional arrangements in place. On the contrary, evidence shows that the transitional measures have only had a limited influence on the distribution of intra-EU mobility, and that mobility flows are driven by other factors, such as general labour demand and language.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are now at a stage where, if any of these 11 Member States wants to continue restrictions, that Member State has to provide clear and solid arguments for serious disturbances in its labour markets because of expected inflows of a labour force from Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very important for us to know how the Commission will assess the evidence that the Member States will present. I plead to the Commission to be a true Guardian of the Treaties and to strictly evaluate the arguments that may be presented for its attention. The criteria should be transparent and objective and should prove that the disturbances are a direct result of the opening up of the market.</p>
      <p sl="en">I hope the Commission will show the strength to reject some of the Member States’ requests if they are not sufficiently backed by objective evidence, and I hope that my colleagues will vote in favour of the resolution tomorrow in order to reconfirm the support that the EU Parliament has always shown for the free movement of workers.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, I would like to begin by welcoming the presence of Commissioner Andor at the plenary, at such a late hour this evening.</p>
      <p sl="ro">When we talk about free access for Romanian and Bulgarian workers to the labour market, we have no more than two very definite scenarios. One is where Member States have accepted workers from Romania and Bulgaria and have recorded economic growth. Italy and Spain are cases in point, with a growth rate of roughly 2%. The Spanish authorities have been expressing their gratitude for several years now to workers from Romania and Bulgaria because, thanks to the latter, they have managed to pay more than 250 000 pensions each year. Then there are other states which oppose Romanian and Bulgarian workers having access to the labour market even today. They are experiencing huge economic problems, very large imbalances on their labour market and are hiding behind excuses which we do no understand very clearly and are not explained very well. In fact, these excuses, more often than not, are at odds with the real situation in their respective countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I say that it is of paramount importance for us to ask these Member States, if they are going to continue to oppose Romanians and Bulgarians having access to the labour market in their countries, to present clear-cut arguments that are quantifiable and transparent, so that we can all understand why the situation in some Member States differs from that in the other European Union Member States. I believe that European legislation must be applied equally by all Member States.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We have encountered, on very many occasions, governments which, when in delicate political situations, have imposed these conditions and restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian workers for electoral reasons, to show that they are fighting for the workers in their country and that this is how they protect their own citizens. I believe that this is wrong. In my view, our common project of building the European Union should be the priority, and that election time and winning elections, which are transient events, should only be of secondary importance.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, labour market restrictions are, admittedly, provided for under the basic EU Treaty. However, the experience from the 10 Member States which joined in 2004 and the two which joined in 2007, along with the survey that was carried out recently, have highlighted that the labour from these countries has had a positive impact in the old states and generated economic growth. On the other hand, the restrictions which have been in force in other Member States have had an adverse impact.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I wish to welcome the decision made by Belgium, which has opened up its labour market, and even that from Germany, which has relaxed its labour market conditions. At the same time, I wish to highlight the paradoxical situation that the Netherlands is in. The Netherlands’ eventual decision to tighten the conditions led to protests by farmers. There is unemployment but, at the same time, there is a labour shortage for demographic reasons. There are disparities between labour markets in different states. There are labour shortages in various professions, but these shortages can be compensated for. Illegal employment is encouraged by having restrictions in place.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I have one final point. I find it bizarre that we are having a discussion here in the European Parliament about the Blue Card and the Seasonal Workers Directive, while we still have restrictions in the internal labour market, at a time when we are talking about strengthening the internal market. This is something we cannot do without complete freedom of labour.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Commissioner, I still do not understand why it is that Romanians and Bulgarians, who are European Union citizens, are often associated with labour from third countries.</p>
      <p sl="ro">All European citizens stand to gain from an open labour market and a strong European internal market.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, freedom of movement of people and workers in the European Union is one of the key benefits of integration. While exiting the economic and financial crisis, we should particularly encourage the mobility of EU citizens. Despite the fact that freedom of movement and the right to take up work in other Member States has long been one of the Union’s core values, EU citizens still face many barriers and obstacles resulting from different national legislative solutions or, as is still the case for workers from Romania and Bulgaria, the introduction of transition periods. At present, only 2% of EU citizens live in a Member State other than that of which they are nationals. However, more than 17% express a willingness to take up work in another EU Member State, which shows that we are dealing with untapped potential. The second stage of the transition period for workers from Bulgaria and Romania will come to an end at the end of 2011. From then on, Member States wishing to extend the transition period will have to prove that an inflow of workers from those countries would cause serious disruption to the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Every country has the right to introduce a transition period, but we as MEPs should strive to ensure that the principles on which such decisions are made are clear and transparent and, to that end, establish a set of indicators for considering such requests. Many Members of this House have raised these matters.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Next year, Croatia will join the European Union. I hope that if Member States do not have conclusive evidence that Croatian workers will threaten the stability of their labour markets, they will show openness and contribute to improving mobility in the European Union. Workers from my country, Poland, have proved through the quality of their work that it is worth opening the doors to mobility.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Madam President, I definitely disagree with the idea of the European Union’s Bulgarian and Romanian citizens being discriminated against in the labour market and facing certain restrictions. Some say that they pose a threat to one labour market or other in certain European Union Member States, but no one has proven that threat. On the contrary, the communication published last month by the European Commission shows precisely that, in countries where Romanians and Bulgarians are working, they are contributing to economic prosperity, to improving life and are beneficial, not the opposite. Today, the Commissioner said that the Commission does not have the powers to present specific uniform criteria specifying what constitutes a major threat to one EU Member State or other should Romanian or Bulgarian citizens come there to work without any restrictions. I cannot understand why we cannot have such uniform criteria and who this will harm. The biggest threat I see is that in the European Union, we have begun to divide everything into several areas: there are European Union Member States, euro area countries and non-euro area countries, people who work freely and those who cannot. It is precisely this that is the greatest threat of all, and not the free and unrestricted movement of workers.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I have a further 10 points to make. We need to distinguish between the matter at hand and, unfortunately – it pains me to say this – the resolution. Firstly, there is the mobility of workers. To this we give our unreserved support. Secondly, the prohibition of discrimination is a fundamental right of the European Union. Thirdly, the free movement of workers is a fundamental right. Fourthly, the internal market can only function if the four fundamental freedoms are implemented everywhere. Fifthly, for this, we also need to create the economic and social union. Sixthly, we must not ignore the fears of the people, although they are unfounded. Seventhly, Austria currently has no reason to maintain the restrictions. However, there is an existing bilateral agreement that must be adhered to. Eighthly, criminalising bilateral agreements harms the cause. We are a community based on the rule of law. My ninth point is that if we violate EU law, the Commission would now have to intervene. Lastly, let us look to the future. Insinuations and apportioning blame are not helpful here. The calls being made here can only be implemented after 2013 when the restrictions expire, and the current regulations cannot interfere with existing agreements. Therefore, despite the nature of this matter, it is difficult to support this resolution.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the prolongation of these transitional barriers for the labour force of Bulgaria and Romania is now outdated and totally unacceptable: five years of discriminatory measures are quite enough. Some of the remaining 11 Member States which have indicated that they intend to maintain these restrictions should try very hard to provide a full justification and arguments and data, because the term ‘serious disturbances of labour markets’ requires very convincing arguments.</p>
      <p sl="en">Some colleagues here have already mentioned the Netherlands. I must say that recently – without any reason – the Netherlands has joined this camp, but they follow in some cases clear xenophobic trends of political behaviour, which is not explicable. If convincing arguments are not provided in such cases of discrimination, this represents a violation of the Accession Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="en">I might say that in this case, the Commission (and I agree with most colleagues) is actually in debt. The Commission sometimes finds definitions in defence of the Treaties. I see a helpless position in this respect, and I would like to urge Commissioner Andor to be much more active and also to convey our concerns to the Commission as a whole.</p>

      <p sl="ro">We call for the lifting of the barriers preventing the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers and for respect for all workers’ fundamental social rights. Lifting these barriers will protect both migrant and host state workers equally. Maintaining these barriers creates conditions for social dumping and affects both workers in the host state and migrant workers who are obliged to accept jobs below their level of qualifications and with a salary lower than that received by a local worker with the same skills.</p>
      <p sl="ro">We call on the EU and Member States to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers, prevent migrants being recruited to work in precarious working and social welfare conditions, and ensure that migrant workers’ families have access to education, health care services and decent housing.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Blue-card answer. – Madam President, I believe that, just like when we are debating budget deficit constraints, here, too, we must put the employment rate in the European Union and social Europe on the same footing. The European Union’s social policy must be on an equal footing with its economic policy: this is what is meant by equality and unanimity regarding the important policies of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I wish to say that today’s subject is very important in view of the words uttered in this Chamber by the Polish Prime Minister and leader of the Polish Presidency. Today, one of the responses to the crisis is deeper integration. We need to resolve the problems that exist in the overall system of restricting the freedom of movement of people, in the form of Schengen, and in the transition periods which, at present, significantly discriminate against citizens of Bulgaria and Romania. We should have more courage in our efforts to ensure that the movement of workers can be an opportunity to develop the European Union and overcome the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="pl">We must today realise that one third of EU citizens do not have any professional qualifications. How are we to achieve mobility, which we specify as being part of the Europe 2020 strategy, if we do not fully open up labour markets for all Member States, also in view of the accession of Croatia? I therefore appeal for courage and for our solutions to include an opening of markets through the free movement of workers with a view to improving Europe’s competitiveness. I therefore appeal for courage and for such action to be taken by the Commission. Parliament’s voice is thus very important.</p>

      <p sl="bg">Madam President, Mr Andor, we are aware that there is a legal basis for extending the restrictions period and that the Commission cannot do much on this issue, particularly if it is not enthusiastic about getting involved more seriously. What we want is for you to draw up clearer criteria which will provide a basis for Member States’ decisions. I think that this option is fully available to you.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Governments must read carefully your last report of 11 November, where the data speaks for itself – there are no grounds for continuing the restrictions. There are no economic indicators suggesting that labour from Bulgaria and Romania poses a threat. On the contrary, the restrictions result only in more undeclared work, with adverse consequences for all participants on the labour market.</p>
      <p sl="bg">Let us not beat about the bush: the reasons for extending the period are solely political. However, the principles of free movement of persons and the right to work cannot be subject to double standards when it comes to implementation. We do not want any favours for Bulgaria and Romania. We simply want fair treatment and a rejection of the policy promoting the systemic humiliation of two European Union Member States and their citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, thank you very much for this lively discussion. I would like to start my answer by saying that, for the countries that joined the European Union in 2007, the same transitional arrangements apply as for the intake of 2004, and the same arrangements also apply to Croatia, for which the agreement was recently signed.</p>
      <p sl="en">This also allows us to look at the experience of the 2004 group by way of comparison. This I believe strongly supports the argument that the receiving countries hugely benefited from mobile workers from new Member States, and also the United Kingdom, on which there has been an exchange of views in the debate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is very important to say that, despite the fact that the actual number of workers coming from Poland and other countries was much higher than originally expected, we have to stress the enormous economic benefit of this contribution as opposed to speaking about these mobile workers being a burden on social security or the health care system.</p>
      <p sl="en">I think it is very useful to look at the debates in Germany and Austria, in which I participated in the spring period of this year, before 1 May, when these two countries also eventually had to open up their labour markets for the 2004 intake. There was clearly a feeling that these two countries probably lost out by maintaining the restrictions until the last possible day, and that perhaps it would have been much wiser for them to have opened up earlier, especially because of the specific demographic conditions of Germany and also the very good labour market performance of the large number of vacancies this country has. I think this should be a lesson and an example for others.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the current situation, I think we have to look at the concrete labour market conditions in each and every country and not only the European average. As we all know, the European averages are not very encouraging. We have been stuck with a very high unemployment rate – about 10% – and the coming year is not expected to be very easy. However, this average masks very great discrepancies, and this is why I would agree with those who suggest that, in countries where the unemployment rate is very low, like Austria or the Netherlands, it will be very difficult to provide factual justification for the maintenance of these restrictions.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also have to stress that some Members of the House rightly pointed to the very complex and sometimes (unfortunately) xenophobic discussions in the Netherlands vis-à-vis mobile worker citizens from other EU Member States. Such discourse definitely does not help a constructive solution or response to this question to emerge.</p>
      <p sl="en">It is very clear that the economies of some of these countries we are speaking about need more workers, also from other EU countries. The business community is expressing this opinion, and I think wise policy makers will pay attention to this. We have been engaged with the governments of these countries: I have written letters to all of them and explained what the rules are and what we expect.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can tell you that we have so far received only one notification or request from Member States about the extension of the restrictions. Previous experience has shown that Member States tend to wait until the very end of the period to send their notifications, and so far only the United Kingdom has sent one, on 24 November.</p>
      <p sl="en">This notification states that the UK decided to retain labour market restrictions following the advice from the Independent Migration Advisory Committee, which stated in its report of 4 November 2011 that, based on an analysis of recent labour market indicators, the UK labour market is in a state of serious disturbance and that removing existing restrictions would increase the risk of an increased inflow of EU2 nationals, with a potential negative impact on the UK labour market. As we know from new statistics, unemployment in the UK is at a 17-year high, but I think it has to be stressed that foreign workers should not be blamed for this. We have to look at the situation in the case of the UK and, should others come, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will check at the beginning of next year whether the Member States that have a right in this context have provided, together with the notification, an explanation – with supporting evidence and pertinent arguments – on the existence of a serious labour market disturbance or threat thereof. If a Member State has, for example, not provided an explanation at all or has not provided an explanation with sufficient data and pertinent arguments, the Commission will ask the Member State to provide the missing information.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission services will examine the notification and the explanations and the data provided by the Member States. I am planning to present my summary to the ministers in the EPSCO Council in February.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This plenary will examine documents that reinforce the right of citizens to participate in the European Common Market, as well as the principal of free movement of workers in the European Union area. One of the documents specifically simplifies the bureaucracy inherent in residence and work applications. With the growing movement between Member States of people who work and live in a Member State other than their country of origin, it is necessary to simplify the bureaucracy of the procedures to eliminate obstacles to a freedom given in the Treaties, thus allowing citizens to fully enjoy their rights. As the free movement of people is a fundamental right, realised through the area of freedom, security and justice, without internal borders, the provisions of the Schengen agreement, which has been extended to more Member States since 1990, must be allowed to definitively encompass all the countries of the EU. Thus, both Romanian and Bulgarian workers should have full access to the countries of the EU and, as such, the transitional provisions in force for these two countries should be abolished, there being no justification for this discrimination. The success of the European project partly depends on a feeling of belonging to the common area. Freedom of movement is thus a right and an imperative for European integration.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The free movement of workers is one of the basic principles of the functioning of the internal market. Any EU citizen is free to seek a job, work, settle or provide services in another Member State. The European labour market can only function properly by complying with this basic principle enshrined in the European Treaties.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Although there are numerous specific initiatives at the moment in the EU promoting labour mobility, we can see that very few people are exercising this right. Unfortunately, some Member States have maintained the restrictions applied to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens under the pretext of protecting their labour market against any imbalance due to labour migration. Several reports contradict the arguments put forward by these countries, based on actual migration figures. Therefore, it has been confirmed that Romanian and Bulgarian workers have a positive impact on the EU economy.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that, in the current global economic climate marked by a powerful economic crisis, it is our obligation to support the lifting of any barriers slowing down the European economy and exerting an adverse impact on the level of labour mobility and the economic integration process in general.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I hope that Member States that are, to this day, keeping their labour markets closed to Bulgarian and Romanian employees will lift their transitional restrictions at the beginning of the coming year. No surveys have confirmed previous concerns about Bulgarian and Romanian employees flooding the Member States, causing serious labour market disturbances after the accession of these countries in 2007. What we are seeing instead is that employees arriving from these two countries take employment in occupations where there is a shortage of workforce, and work in jobs for which there are few applicants from within a country’s borders. I therefore find the intention of some EU Member States to maintain the barriers set in place against these employees even in the last phase of the seven-year transitory period to be unjustified. The exclusion of Bulgarian and Romanian citizens from Member State labour markets opens up avenues for semi-legal, undeclared work and fake enterprises, which goes hand in hand with the abuse of employees’ rights. It is an important goal to enable appropriate jobs to be filled by appropriate workers. This requires Member States to take the right of workers to move freely within the European Union seriously. It is the responsibility of the European Commission to allow Member States intending to continue to maintain transitory barriers after 1 January 2012 to do so only if they can provide convincing arguments and justification supported by authentic data.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Jens Geier, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the budgetary control of EU financial assistance to Afghanistan (2011/2014(INI)) (Α7-0388/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-542-000" speaker_id="96833" name="Jens Geier" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="de">Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are there 111 774 or 125 218 officers serving in Afghanistan’s national police force? This question remains to be answered. That is one of the problems that we encounter when we examine the issue of the use of EU aid in Afghanistan. This question is not inconsequential, as the salaries of the Afghan police officers are paid through the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA), which was set up by the United Nations Development Programme. LOTFA is the largest recipient of financial aid in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="de">We do not know how many police officers there are because the databases of the Afghan police force are unreliable. Up to now, the European Union has provided funds to Afghanistan via three different channels. There is the use of private contracting partners which fulfil contracts issued by the European Commission. There are non-governmental organisations and there are the multi-donor trust funds, the largest being maintained by the United Nations, and there is another important one that was set up by the World Bank for the development of Afghanistan. These are the channels through which the European Union’s projects in Afghanistan, which must meet a number of criteria, are financed. They are to ensure the visibility of the European Union in Afghanistan. They are to support capacity building in the public administration. They must not be vulnerable to corruption. They must be sustainable. They are to be aligned with the regional priorities, but also with the priorities of the government. If we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the channels through which we transfer funds to Afghanistan, then we see that not all of the criteria can be met via any one channel, but that each of the different channels that the European Union uses to transfer funds to Afghanistan has its own particular strengths, but also its own particular risks.</p>
      <p sl="de">Two of the important objectives, namely, capacity building in the public administration and alignment with the priorities of the government, cannot be met at all via the channels used up to now. In my report, I therefore propose that we use a fourth channel, one that is now used for Afghanistan by many donors in the international community although not as yet by the European Union, and that is the channel of direct budget support to the Afghan state.</p>
      <p sl="de">This direct support to the Afghan budget brings with it a number of problems. One of these became very clear in media reports when it was found that cash – dollars in this case – was immediately being taken out of Afghanistan by the box-load, and I am pleased to be able to say at this point that, if these boxes contained any European funds at all, it would have only been a very small amount. With their direct budget support, the Americans had to learn a very expensive lesson in using this channel. However, they have learnt that lesson. They are proceeding step by step. They are taking it department by department of the Afghan ministries and ensuring that certain criteria are met, namely, that management and control systems are employed, that there are mechanisms for combating corruption in place, and that accountability to the Afghan Parliament is ensured. I believe that if the European Commission were to follow the same path, that is to say, take a step-wise approach, set clear goals for the Afghan Government that are retrievable and possible to monitor, ensure that there is accountability to the Afghan Parliament and – I believe this is very important – a truly independent Afghan court of auditors, then we can also support the use of this channel.</p>
      <p sl="de">After the withdrawal of the military, there will be a greater need for civilian aid. We must therefore ensure that this aid functions in a targeted, effective and sustainable way and that the funds provided by the European Union are protected against corruption and waste. That is in the best interests not only of European taxpayers, but of Afghanistan, too.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, personally, I am somewhat dubious about giving any aid to Afghanistan from European Union funds. This is a state where, a few short months ago, Osama Bin Laden was found in a custom-built compound under the noses of the Afghan authorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">Until we are satisfied that things are in order, that funds can be used for what they are designed for, and that we can satisfy the European Court of Auditors and other independent auditing bodies, I think we should progress very slowly with this matter.</p>
      <p sl="en">In an ideal world, we should give assistance, because we need to be neighbourly. However, without having firm guarantees in place that any money coming from the European Union is going to be used in a proper fashion and that we can guarantee that, I think we should be very careful about moving along too quickly.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for this report. I am a member of the Delegation for Afghanistan. I know that this country was, for 30 years, involved in a notorious war and that all the foundations of a democratic and transparent state were shattered and simply did not exist. This state is being recreated from scratch. This is why it is so important to combine UN and World Bank funds with our own European resources. They should be accounted for using similar channels, which must be based on a system of transparency and, in particular, on measurable indicators of how effectively the aid is being used.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It seems to me that all elements should be dealt with. This, of course, requires a strengthening of government administration, which has its own goals, because the country needs to be reconstructed. However, we should remember that non-governmental organisations must be supported in parallel, and thus the channel of distribution of funds by organisations is also important. There is no private sector, but it is also key to the redistribution of funds, which must be used efficiently. I therefore consider that we should create exactly what the rapporteur says – clear steps towards transparency and efficiency and, above all, accounting that, over time, is based on clear and understandable principles.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, the EU provides funding and humanitarian aid to many developing countries. One such country is Afghanistan, which has long been plagued by civil war. The unstable security situation in the country makes it impossible, however, to carry out the necessary monitoring of the distribution and actual use of the funds provided. The risk of fraud, corruption, and non-compliance with the rules or effectiveness criteria is very high in such an environment. It is therefore necessary to focus more on proven methods and procedures which have shown their worth in the provision of civilian aid, and to opt rather for support for long-term useful projects, the success of which can be monitored in individual phases, along with the sensible disbursement of funds. If projects do not prosper, they can be halted in time and, where appropriate, modified.</p>

      <p sl="en">It is an interesting situation there, and there are many fears for post-2014, but since the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, there has been a 60% increase in health care provision, with infant mortality reduced by 20%. Education has increased – obviously including females – with 13 000 more schools, 170 000 more teachers and 7.3 million more students.</p>
      <p sl="en">These are things that we need to build on. I am glad – amazed actually – that the European Parliament is having this debate here tonight and actually showing some concern about where the money goes. This makes a welcome change from previous years.</p>
      <p sl="en">We must continue to help Afghanistan build, because it was a factory of terrorism.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Geier, for his contribution to the effectiveness and efficiency of EU development assistance in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission shares the view that our commitment to Afghanistan must focus on the long-term perspective. At the Bonn conference on 5 December 2011, the EU looked to the Afghan Government to provide the context for this long-term engagement by improving governance and the rule of law and making other structural reforms which are necessary for the transformation of Afghanistan into a fully-functioning, sustainable state at the service of its people.</p>
      <p sl="en">In Bonn, the EU and its Member States also announced the negotiation of a partnership agreement on cooperation and development with Afghanistan. This agreement will create a coherent, legally-binding overall framework for EU relations with Afghanistan. This long-term commitment will be conditional on the Afghan Government’s progress in further strengthening public finance management systems, reducing corruption, improving budget execution, developing a financing strategy and increasing government capacity. The establishment of a fully independent control and audit office will also remain a precondition for budget support.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Afghan Government progressively takes over full responsibility for security and development, we also expect democratic institutions to be strengthened both at central and provincial level. In this context, the Commission will continue to assist Afghanistan by ensuring that monitoring mechanisms adequately address corruption and proper management of aid and that the recipient communities are involved in identifying needs and shaping development assistance policies.</p>
      <p sl="en">Shortcomings of external assistance in Afghanistan are the result of a complex mix of political factors, military insurgency, economic underdevelopment and drug trafficking, to name just a few. In this environment, multi-donor trust funds have been instrumental in pooling donors around Afghan-owned strategies, harmonising aid and contributing to strengthening national public finance management capacities. They also enable the efficient donor division of labour and facilitate pooling donors’ specific expertise and resources.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EU aims to surpass the goal of providing 50% of development assistance either directly (on budget) or through multi-donor trust funds, as agreed within the Kabul Process. In Buzan earlier this month, the Commission reiterated its commitment towards aid effectiveness, focusing and deepening on results and accountability, ownership, transparency and reduced fragmentation of aid. This is also our commitment to Afghanistan.</p>
      <p sl="en">With 2014 on the horizon, we will need to focus on reinforcing current mechanisms to ensure that Afghanistan becomes a fully-functioning and sustainable state capable of fighting fraud and corruption.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, I would like to say a few brief words on Afghanistan. I have, of course, also read the report. Between 2002 and 2010 alone, the European Union invested more than EUR 2 billion in Afghanistan. In my view, this report comes to a very clear conclusion: there are a high number of cases of corruption and there is a lack of ability on the part of the administration, a high risk of waste and no independent audit authorities, there are projects that lack sustainability and effectiveness and there are unrealistic timeframes for the projects. In my opinion, as the budgetary control authority, we cannot provide a guarantee to European taxpayers that the funds are used in Afghanistan in an economically effective and sustainable way. In the medium term, we cannot guarantee that these problems will be resolved, either. For this reason, I reach a different conclusion to some of my other fellow Members and that is that we should end this armed development assistance in Afghanistan as quickly as possible.</p>

Our role and duty as the European Parliament is to maintain the principle of sound budgetary management of financial assistance granted by the EU, via the Community budget, from European taxpayers’ money. The maintenance of this principle must apply to assistance granted both to EU Member States and to third countries. In this spirit, I warmly support the rapporteur’s call for the European Commission to address the weaknesses identified in the audits carried out by the European Court of Auditors and third-party auditing agencies. Accountability in respect of EU funds channelled to Afghanistan and managed by various UN agencies also needs to be strengthened and the EU institutions need to gain access to the internal reports produced by those agencies. With transparency and accountability, we can ensure that the money from the UN budget is spent correctly and effectively.</p>

    <intervention id="3-553-000" speaker_id="96737" name="Nicole Kiil-Nielsen" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, a great deal has been achieved in the four years since we implemented the EU strategy for Central Asia. The Union has established a continuous political dialogue and regular dialogues on human rights. Initiatives and important programmes have been activated in support of the EU’s seven priority areas.</p>
      <p sl="fr">However, in light of the Arab Spring, and in the context of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan, which is already under way, bearing in mind the tragic events of southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, the limitations of our strategy are much more visible today, and this requires a major re-assessment on our part.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The strategy is due to be reviewed by the European External Action Service in 2012, and we therefore considered that some key recommendations should be set out in the report, based on the following observation: the EU is unable to reconcile its values and interests in effective programmes that are adapted to the realities and developments in the region. Europe lacks visibility there. Its presence is still in its early stages. The funding devoted to the strategy is modest and would even appear to be under threat. We do not give sufficient open support to civil society, independent media or human rights defenders. Sometimes, in fact, it is pro-government foundations that benefit from European financial support, much to the frustration of genuine NGOs.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In the light of this situation, the European Parliament is convinced that it should develop a new EU approach based on human security and regional cooperation. All our actions, projects and initiatives should follow the guiding principle of promoting human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Europe and its Western partners, who are bogged down in the quagmire of Afghanistan and concerned about their military bases in the region, have, for too long, given priority to the stability of the regimes in place rather than human rights. However, stability based on repression does not last long, and the Arab Spring is proof of that.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We should be careful not to make the same mistakes twice, and we must be capable of better responding to the political vacuum that a similar change could trigger in Central Asia, in a context of ethnic and regional conflicts. In Kazakhstan, trade unions in the oil sector have been on strike for more than six months despite merciless repression. Early legislative elections will be held on 15 January 2012, against a backdrop of unprecedented social tension and the banning of political parties. Will we have the courage and honesty to tell the Kazhak Government that the EU will draw the appropriate conclusions from these events during negotiations on future partnership and cooperation agreements?</p>
      <p sl="fr">We are alarmed by the Human Rights Watch report published yesterday on the indescribably cruel torture that is carried out in Uzbekistan prisons. In Tashkent, human rights defenders have just been arrested. We were happy to hear Baroness Ashton, in Parliament, insisting that human rights should henceforth form the backbone of all of our external action. We therefore recommend carrying out a review of our strategy for Central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I am especially proud of the fact that Parliament has put conditionality and the principles of differentiation and ‘more for more’ at the heart of its new approach, while recommending that we should enhance our support for civil society and independent media organisations. The EU cannot be honest in one part of the world while failing to respond to violations of its values in another.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly, we should consider regional cooperation. The challenges these countries are facing call for a concerted approach: ethnic conflicts, water resource management, security problems, circulation of arms and trafficking of drugs and people. These threats directly affect the security and stability of Central Asia, and also of Europe. We therefore recommend that the EU should play the role of mediator and facilitator. In order to promote dialogue between these countries, we recommend establishing an ad hoc parliamentary forum, which the EU, through the European Parliament delegation, could propose to the parliaments of the five Central Asian countries. MEPs would thus be able to share their experience and expertise while meeting with their counterparts.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I rather like this report. I think it has much to offer both in terms of the European strategy, and particularly in the five countries involved. Indeed it must be recognised that the European Union, since it developed this strategy in 2007, has made much progress in Central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="en">That needs to continue. We can do so much to help the lives of the people in all the fields that are important – the rule of law, human rights, water quality, transport, energy, etc. – and we must avail ourselves of that opportunity. This is an area that is of strategic importance to us and, particularly by developing closer relations with it, the entire area can benefit. Particularly, I would like to see regular EU-Central Asian summits. In that way, one could engage better, have an overall view and see what progress needs to be made in the future.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, in light of the commercial and energy security potential of Central Asia and the interest shared by the countries of Central Asia and the European Union in diversifying export routes and cooperating on energy and environmental sustainability, I support the need to develop strategies associated with the EU’s programmes and strategies in the Caucasus and Black Sea regions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">The countries in the Caspian region and the Middle East, such as Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, have the largest natural gas deposits in the world. I should emphasise the importance of the Nabucco project, which will ensure the transport of gas from the Caspian Sea region, Central Asia and the Middle East to the European Union. This project will contribute to the European Union’s energy security.</p>
      <p sl="ro">There are 3.5 billion people living in countries rich in oil, gas and minerals. Good governance in utilising these resources can generate substantial incomes so as to boost economic growth and reduce poverty. This is why I support the signing of long-term supply agreements targeting the principles of environmental sustainability, as well as the initiative on transparency in the mining industries, aimed at consolidating governance by improving transparency and accountability in the mining industries.</p>

      <p sl="it">Madam President, Commissioner, there are many facts that unfortunately lead us to the conclusion that human rights and freedom of expression are constantly being violated in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p sl="it">I can give an actual example, to back up my statement. On 26 October 2011, cameraman Asan Amilov and journalist Orken Bizenov were the victims of an armed attack in the district of Mańğystau. Their newspaper Stan.kz first went into print in March 2007 with a network of correspondents throughout Central Asia, providing prompt and professional information about what was going on in Kazakhstan and its neighbouring countries, and winning a positive response from the people.</p>
      <p sl="it">It is surely no coincidence that the attackers took the journalists’ laptop, which contained important video footage from the strikes of the oil company workers in Mańğystau. This is just the latest of many examples of intimidation which all too often involve the public authorities.</p>
      <p sl="it">I call on the Commission to take a decisive stance in condemning such practices and to take their attempts to violate the freedom of the press into due consideration in the EU’s negotiations with these countries.</p>
      <p sl="it">Finally, I support the proposal to organise a round table at EU level between the Kazakhstan authorities, the workers’ representatives in the province of Mańğystau and the oil company representatives, in order to find a solution to the serious situation that emerged with the strikes of May 2011.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for this report. I am a member of the Delegation for Central Asia and am happy to accept the underlying principles of this strategy. In the area of democratisation and human rights, we must ask ourselves whether the European Union wishes to be a global player that fosters precisely those values associated with human rights and freedom. To this end, we must resolutely join forces with the UN and the UNDP, because these activities run in parallel and are often not connected. We can increase efficiency if we act together. This is the first and an important consideration. In the economic field, there is the matter of energy and the Nabucco pipeline. Unfortunately, our action has come a little too late. The Chinese, who have an extra pipeline of their own, have taken advantage and are ahead of us in this regard. We should be more active in the area of energy and in our entire strategy regarding rare earth metals.</p>
      <p sl="pl">In my opinion, we are able to pass on a very large amount of experience to these new states, each with varying degrees of democratisation, in the area of building democracy. Let us put this great asset to effect. Let us also use it to ensure that action is taken in parallel on economic issues and human rights. This strategy will then surely be effective.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, we need to understand that Russian influence and a traditionally Russian style of governing are relatively strong in this area. This means that if we want to help this region, we should stay put and remain active there, because if we pull out, as the rapporteur suggests, we will surrender the entire area to the control of powers such as China and Russia, and the people living in the area will have no alternative, and they will not have the vision of a better society that we are holding out to them. From this perspective, I believe we should stay in this area, but we should try a combination of commercial and economic cooperation and link this to human rights. If the governments in the region see some profit from our projects, and a better standard of living, then they will think more about what we want from them in the area of human rights, and if these economic projects are advantageous and profitable for them, they will be willing to accept our view of the world and our human rights criteria, and to change the structure of their society. We therefore need a combined approach. We must not expect success right from the start.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I welcome the European Parliament draft resolution on the implementation of the EU strategy for Central Asia. It is a timely contribution for the review of the strategy which will be undertaken over the coming year.</p>
      <p sl="en">Central Asia is a region of growing importance to the European Union. The region borders Afghanistan and faces security threats with implications for the EU. These implications include terrorism, drug trafficking and other cross-border crime.</p>
      <p sl="en">Widespread poverty in some countries and incomplete political and economic reform processes pose challenges, not only for the countries themselves, but also for regional cooperation and security. At the same time, the region is rich in resources and has the potential of diversifying energy export routes to the EU and contributing to EU energy security.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is significant interest among the countries in the region to strengthen relations with the EU. Since the adoption of the strategy on Central Asia by the European Council in 2007, the EU has managed with limited resources, and within a relatively short time, to significantly increase its role in central Asia.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our key role in close cooperation with the OSCE and the UN in helping the Kyrgyz Republic to overcome its crisis last year and supporting the development of a parliamentary democracy there is a good example of the importance of our increased engagement.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strategy on Central Asia has led to other important developments worth noting. We have established regular high-level political dialogue between the EU and Central Asia regionally, at the level of foreign ministers. We have established regular human rights dialogues with all five countries. On energy, we are closer than ever to making our trans-Caspian pipeline a reality, with the participation of Turkmenistan in the southern energy gas corridor.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the sensitive area of water, we are now engaging in water policy dialogues to improve domestic water management polices, as has been done in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.</p>
      <p sl="en">On education, more Central Asian students than ever are coming to the EU and the EU is heavily involved with education sector reform in several countries.</p>
      <p sl="en">Our technical assistance programme to support border management reform and combating drug trafficking remain among the leading international programmes in the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">As regards international financial institutions, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development continues to be a leading investor, to develop the private sector primarily, and we have expanded the mandate of the European Investment Bank to cover Central Asia, with a focus on energy and environment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We have managed to open new EU delegations in the region: in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and hopefully also in Turkmenistan in the not too distant future.</p>
      <p sl="en">The region more broadly continues to face difficult chapters and much remains to be done in terms of our relations with the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">The human rights situation is of general concern, as has been pointed out by Ms Alfano, and we need to see how best to make more of our engagements in this sensitive but very important area.</p>
      <p sl="en">As noted, we need to open delegations in all countries, which is important for increasing EU visibility and for promoting EU programmes, views and interests more efficiently. And given our admittedly limited financial resources for the region, the coordination of assistance with other international donors is crucial and has to be intensified continuously. The fact that our resources are limited has also made it increasingly important to focus our assistance, as the European Parliament report rightly points out. This is already taking place with a limited amount of focal sectors per country.</p>
      <p sl="en">Poverty alleviation remains a key objective and the poorest countries in the region – the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan – remain the primary beneficiaries of EU assistance.</p>
      <p sl="en">The region is diverse and, while we promote regional cooperation, notably on crucial issues such as water management, border management and drug trafficking, we have bilateral agendas with the five countries following their respective tracks, depending on individual needs and ambitions in terms of moving towards the EU and reform objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">With Kazakhstan, for example, we just recently opened negotiations on an enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which will be a first for the region.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that the European Parliament has an important role to play as we move forward in our relations with Central Asia. We strongly welcome European Parliament visits to the countries and regular interparliamentary dialogue and the increased parliamentary engagement that the report envisages. Again, we welcome Parliament’s report which provides important input for our upcoming review and I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

In the light of major developments in Europe and the world, the EU has summed up its achievements in its relations with this part of the world.</p>
      <p sl="it">This report underlines the need for a new approach focusing on strengthening long-term cooperation and a mutual strategic commitment in order to deepen the political, social and economic relations. The text also highlights the need to maintain a high level of commitment in all areas of society, thanks also to more financial resources, funding and programmes.</p>
      <p sl="it">Furthermore, the report draws attention to the institutional value of the partnership and cooperation agreements (PCAs) as the basis for exchanges with these countries and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committees as tools that can guarantee a regular platform for strengthening bilateral relations with countries in Central Asia.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Karima Deli, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on health and safety at work (2011/2147(INI)) (A7-0409/2011).</p>
    </intervention>
    <intervention id="3-564-000" speaker_id="96868" name="Karima Delli" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur">
      <p sl="fr">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis should in no way be used as a pretext for neglecting health and safety at work. Our aim is to provide good-quality employment to all workers, despite persistent mass unemployment and a sharp rise in casual work. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at work, 168 000 people die each year in Europe as a result of work-related accidents and illnesses, of which more than half are cancers, and one quarter are cardio-vascular diseases. How can we not be shocked by this growing number?</p>
      <p sl="fr">As rapporteur for the review of the European strategy on health and safety at work, which will come to an end in 2012, my conclusions are clear. It would be morally wrong to turn a blind eye to people’s suffering at work. It would also be a mistake in economic terms, because all the studies indicate that accidents and professional illnesses are very costly, both to our health and social security systems and to our businesses.</p>
      <p sl="fr">From 2013 onwards, this strategy should be more ambitious, more consistent and, above all, more courageous. To achieve that, we need to strengthen the legislative framework and adapt current legislation to new occupational hazards such as psychosocial risks, musculoskeletal problems and nanomaterials. Work-related stress should not be treated merely with training courses, as this has proven entirely insufficient given that half of all European workers are exposed to risks that affect their mental health. The truth should be spelled out. Workers suffer, in particular, from the sudden reorganisation or intensification of their work and poor methods of management.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, many employees draw attention to dangers for people as well as the environment. These workers must be protected. I am proud that Parliament is calling on the Commission to establish a directive that protects these much talked about whistle-blowers.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Commission should not hesitate to bring infringement proceedings against Member States that do not respect their obligations. European harmonisation in the health sphere is a significant step forward.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is also vital to foster a culture of prevention in Europe. The Member States should increase the staff employed in their labour inspection services and seek to achieve the objective of one inspector per 10 000 workers, in accordance with International Labour Organisation recommendations.</p>
      <p sl="fr">There is absolutely no justification for weakening the prevention rules in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or for independent workers, who enjoy the same fundamental right to health protection.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Furthermore, we have observed an increase in outsourcing of work and the emergence of subcontracting chains. There are new groups of workers who are not covered by prevention policies: casual workers, bogus self-employed people, subcontracted workers, and so on. Given the risk of exposure to powerful radiation and the dangers linked to the management of radioactive waste, it is essential that rigorous standards are applied to training, safety at work and inspection by independent bodies.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, we need to take stock of new, emerging hazards, such as chemical and biological risks, which are complex but for which there is still insufficient data. Rapid action needs to be taken on asbestos, silica and other recognised carcinogens. The REACH provisions play a very important part in preventing cancers and other work-related diseases. It needs to be kept up-to-date and comprehensively implemented.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Finally, professional illnesses should be recognised, or better recognised, starting with cancers, in order to quickly identify all of the issues.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on all of you to support my report, because I am perfectly sure that it will enable us to meet all these challenges, and that Europe has a role to play. It should protect all workers, who must not lose their lives on account of their job.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner, I hope that, from 2013, there will be a European strategy on health and safety at work, and I truly hope that we will make swift progress on this.</p>

      <p sl="el">Madam President, I wish to congratulate and thank Karima Delli on her excellent report. I had the pleasure and honour of acting as shadow rapporteur for the socialists on this report and I consider it my duty to remind the House of the outcome of the vote on this report in committee: there were 36 votes for and just two against. I think that is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="el">I would also like to remind the House that asbestos kills workers, that musculoskeletal diseases cause them pain and that stress leads workers to commit suicide. Our defence against all this is a new strategy for health and safety at work from 2012 onwards. The weapon with which we can defend ourselves in this situation is new legislation, a new directive. That, Commissioner, is in your hands; you have all the scientific data, you have all the documents and – most importantly – you have the support of the European Parliament to act and safeguard conditions of health and safety for workers, especially during these difficult times with the economic crisis in Europe.</p>

    <intervention id="3-566-000" speaker_id="96781" name="Danuta Jazłowiecka" is_mep="True" mode="spoken">
      <p sl="pl">Madam President, an economic crisis is usually a very difficult period not only for entrepreneurs but also for employees. Companies which are seeking to minimise their operating costs pay much less attention to health and safety principles. We cannot forget that the European strategy on this matter is being implemented in specific economic circumstances, and that these have a major impact on its effectiveness.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Currently, the biggest threat facing employees is the ever-present risk that they will lose their job, and closely linked to that is the all too frequent phenomenon of bullying. Employers and superiors may take advantage of their status knowing that the situation on the labour market places them in a privileged position. Few people are in a position to stand up to the aggression they experience, knowing that they could end up losing their only source of income. I therefore also believe that we should focus on this phenomenon. The lack of a common, harmonised definition of bullying at European level is undoubtedly a huge oversight. For this reason, I back the appeal by the Commission and the Member States for the development of national strategies to combat violence in the workplace. However, these strategies must be based on a definition of bullying which is common to the Member States and an effective campaign to inform people of their rights. I agree with my fellow Member Karima Delli’s call to adopt and support this report.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, despite the fact that there is an extensive acquis communautaire in the area of health and safety at work, the practical experience of workers in everyday life shows that the legislation actually adopted is often not enough. Securing compliance with one of the basic rights – the right to health – requires the regular updating of laws and implementing measures, in line with the latest medical knowledge concerning health risks. In my opinion, the main problem at the moment is the lack of attention paid to chemical risks, which have an extremely negative effect on workers. There are still no comprehensive studies on these risks, although the occurrence of cancers and other chronic diseases is rising sharply. Employees should be regularly and adequately informed as to the risks associated with long-term exposure to carcinogenic materials which, unfortunately, cannot yet be substituted. The identification of such materials must also lead to their substitution, without unnecessary delays.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, how many men does it take to change a light bulb? In one English council, tenants must send for council staff, who may not use ladders, only scaffolding. That is three people: one holds the rigging, one changes the bulb and one supervises.</p>
      <p sl="en">That is the crazy English, but I do have better examples. At a meeting six years ago, I was astonished to hear of the number of young people injured at work. The independent body – unconnected with the EU – which had called the meeting suggested a range of safe practices which they claimed had reduced these figures – without legislation.</p>
      <p sl="en">As I have said before, good ideas always spread, and a Latvian took these documents to use locally. But the EU legislates; we do it every day. Why – if good results can be achieved by unbiased advice from non-political sources? So I ask that elements of this draft report, such as simplifying existing legislation, implementing national strategies and adjusting to the context of Member States, carry through to the final, advisory version. Voluntary systems are always best: no infringement proceedings.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Madam President, 168 000 European citizens die from work-related accidents or diseases every year, while another 7 million are injured in work-related accidents. About 50% of workers in the European Union do not have access to preventive services at their workplace, especially in SMEs and subcontracting chains. Investment in occupational risk prevention policies ensures growth in productivity and competitiveness, as well as viable social security systems and a decrease in social security costs estimated at 5.9% of GDP.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Austerity measures during the economic crisis must not jeopardise health and safety measures at work. I should highlight the recognition of poor working conditions and the adoption of health and safety measures required for workplaces like this.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I think that the gender aspect needs to be integrated into the policies of the 2007-2012 European strategy on health and safety at work to provide a better reflection of the specific risks facing women at work.</p>

      <p sl="ga">Madam President, although it is late at night, the issues we are discussing are very important, especially this one in relation to the health and safety of our own workers. I would like to thank my friend, Ms Delli, for the fine report she presented to us here tonight.</p>
      <p sl="ga">In common parlance, this is a no-brainer. Obviously, the healthier and safer workers are, the more productive they will be, the happier they will be and the greater sense of ownership they will have. There will be a concomitant reduction in terms of absenteeism and social security costs.</p>
      <p sl="ga">While legislation cannot do everything, it is nevertheless important that we legislate, particularly in the areas that Mrs Delli mentioned of carcinogenic, biological and chemical risks. Also, my experience is that, where legislation is taken seriously, people actually go beyond that legislation. Recently, I was asked to present the National Health and Safety Awards for all sorts of businesses – big and small – in Ireland. I was absolutely amazed at the lengths to which companies went to secure the health and safety of their workers and the bond that it created within and between the workforce and the management. Certainly a great deal can be learned from that.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I agree that we must continue with efforts towards systematic improvements in safety for our workers.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We need to understand, however, that the economic situation is putting pressure on employers to save on safety measures and safety training, with some of them going so far as to take on undeclared workers. On the other hand, the economic situation is also putting pressure on the unemployed, and on people who want to work and are willing to risk more for work, in order to get work and who are sometimes willing, of course, to do undeclared work. We therefore need to respond very effectively and readily to the social changes currently taking place, and to amend our employment legislation so that it responds to this situation. We must emphasise that the employer is always fully responsible for work safety. Employers must also train their employees, provide protective measures and, in the event of injury or accident, bear the consequences. Employees must be assisted in court proceedings and the recovery of damages, and then employers will learn that they are responsible for any injuries or damage to health.</p>
      <p sl="sk">From this perspective, we must get more involved in our legislation and try to improve these rules.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in February 2007, the Commission adopted a communication entitled ‘Improving quality and productivity at work: Community strategy 2007-2012 on safety and health at work’.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strategy provided a political framework for improving occupational safety and health over the period 2007 to 2012 and laid out a road map for stakeholders to play an active role in achieving the objectives it identified. The fact that it was welcomed by all EU institutions highlights the importance of such an EU strategic framework for coordinating national policy and ensuring that workers enjoy safer and healthier conditions at work.</p>
      <p sl="en">In particular, this House adopted a resolution on 15 January 2008 calling on the Commission to report to it on progress made at the half-way stage. In April this year, the Commission published a staff working paper entitled ‘Mid-term review of the European strategy 2007-2012 on health and safety at work’. It takes stock of what has been achieved now that the strategy has reached the half-way mark, re-examines the policy orientations and sets out proposals for the future of EU policy on safety and health at work.</p>
      <p sl="en">The results of the mid-term review confirm that the strategy remains broadly fit for purpose, despite the changes that have taken place in the Union since 2007, and, in particular, the impact of the financial and economic crisis.</p>
      <p sl="en">The strategy’s prime objective is achieving an ‘ongoing, sustainable and uniform reduction in accidents at work and occupational illnesses’. Given the overall reduction in incidence in the period covered by the previous EU strategy, the strategy set an ambitious target to reduce the total incidence of accidents at work in the 27 Member States by 25% from 2007 to 2012. A final estimate for the whole period covered by the strategy may not be available until 2014. This is because of time constraints related to collecting and processing national data by Eurostat. The findings in the mid-term review show a general positive development involving a reduction in accidents at work over the period 2007 to 2009.</p>
      <p sl="en">But, despite this progress, there is still work to do under the current strategy. From the Commission’s viewpoint, the assessment of the first part of the period covered by the strategy highlights a number of priorities.</p>
      <p sl="en">First, there is a need to simplify and update existing legislation and finalise proposals for legislation, after consulting the social partners and the stakeholders extensively. This relates, in particular, to the proposal for a revision of Directive 2004/40/EC on electromagnetic fields (the Commission proposal was adopted in June 2011 and is now being discussed by the colegislators) and the proposal for a new directive on ergonomics to replace the existing manual handling and display screen equipment directives (the Commission proposal may be adopted in the first half of 2012). Furthermore, the Commission will carry out an extensive screening of the implementation of all EU health and safety legislation, covering the period 2007 to 2012. The Commission is required to present its final report on this in 2015 at the latest.</p>
      <p sl="en">Second, we need to consolidate the encouraging results of the first phase of implementation and to take them further in terms of adopting and implementing national strategies for occupational safety and health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Third, we need to build on experience with Scoreboard 2009, with a view to developing a structured and commonly accepted monitoring tool for evaluating future EU strategies for occupational safety and health.</p>
      <p sl="en">Fourth, we need to carry out the final evaluation of the current strategy and, based on the findings, to identify the next steps in the health and safety area for the period after 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission welcomes the Parliament’s decision to discuss and adopt a report on the mid-term review of the EU strategy on health and safety at work.</p>
      <p sl="en">I appreciate the ambitious nature of this document and share the House’s view of the importance of occupational safety and health policy, which is one of the most advanced areas of European social policy. The importance of health and safety at work does not diminish at a time of crisis and my recent visit to the Bilbao Agency for Occupational Health and Safety was meant to signal this.</p>
      <p sl="en">In line with the Europe 2020 strategy, improving working conditions goes naturally with job creation, promoting permanent employment and higher productivity, as the Commission highlighted in its communication on ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs’.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2012, the Commission will complete the final evaluation of the current strategy and adopt a communication on EU occupational safety and health policy priorities for the post-2012 period based on the results of that evaluation. I can also add that I have started to work very closely with the Danish Presidency to keep health and safety among our priorities in the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="en">The European strategy 2007-2012 on health and safety at work ensures the fundamental right of EU citizens to have access to safe and favourable working conditions.</p>
      <p sl="en">While those in high-skilled positions enjoy a work environment that safeguards the health and safety of its employees, those in low-skilled and low-paying positions are subject to increased vulnerability as a result of illness, accidents and other work-related traumas. Acknowledging the pervasiveness of precarious working conditions is the first step in challenging the status quo.</p>
      <p sl="en">A number of roadblocks exist, of course. Undeclared labourers are arguably most at risk because of the informal agreement between them and their employers. They must be incentivised to guarantee the provision of a set of fair working conditions regardless of the skill level of their employees. Like other Member States, Romania’s Labour Code explicitly provides for the protection of the health and safety of workers, yet applying it in practice remains a significant challenge.</p>

      <p sl="de">I would like to thank Ms Delli for this report. The importance of health cannot be emphasised often enough. According to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in Bilbao, almost 28% of European workers claim to have significant health problems. This means that one in four workers in Europe is affected. Therefore, we must not only apply the existing occupational health legislation better in the Member States; we must also develop and improve it further, because the workplace is constantly changing, too. Whereas physical ailments were previously the top work-related illnesses, today it is mostly mental disorders that are on the rise in the workplace. This development, in particular, must be investigated thoroughly by means of improved health monitoring. The measures need to be adapted for this purpose. Prevention must also play a greater role. Furthermore, we must not forget that there are also certain groups whose health needs special protection. It has been proven that young, older and migrant workers and workers with precarious jobs are more frequently exposed to occupational hazards. If people are working without previous training or the necessary skills, the risk of disease or accident increases sharply. We must prevent this from happening.</p>
