      <p sl="en">Mr President, I take note of the importance many of you have attached to the future of the file on the private programme. I agree that the European Union’s social dimension takes particular importance in a time of crisis, uncertainty and hardship like the present situation today. The unemployed, the vulnerable and the socially excluded expect Europe to show solidarity and help them in practical and clear ways.</p>
      <p sl="en">The main EU instrument to support the employability and inclusion of the most vulnerable members of our societies will, of course, remain a strong European Social Fund. That is why the Commission proposed a guaranteed minimum budget for the ESF representing at least 25% of cohesion policy and that at least 20% of the funding for each Member State should be allocated to social inclusion measures. We also proposed that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund be maintained and strengthened as a way to show real solidarity with newly unemployed workers in particularly difficult circumstances. In the Commission’s view, a programme to assist the most deprived people in Europe should form part of these efforts.</p>
      <p sl="en">The harsh reality is that there will always be people in our societies in need of a programme of this kind and that is why the Commission’s proposal for the multiannual financial framework seeks to allow the EU budget to continue to finance full assistance under heading 1, where it also fits more appropriately with the poverty reduction target of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
      <p sl="en">This would also be the best way to solve the legal impediment which was raised against the current scheme. As you know, discussions among the Member States on the legal basis for the current programme revealed difficulties in finding agreement on EU financial support for full assistance. The Commission had to take note of this, of course, but we will not give up on our right of initiative.</p>
      <p sl="en">To conclude, in our view, the EU budget could support full assistance in the future as well in the framework of a wider effort to fight poverty. The Commission is currently looking at various options on shaping the future programme within the cohesion policy framework in a way that maximises the impact of the support the various cohesion policy funds can deliver.</p>
      <p sl="en">We still need some time to work out a model which is both effective and realistic. Let me close by thanking Parliament for its very helpful contribution to our work and for raising this point for debate.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, on 15 February of this year, we decided, by a vote during the second reading, to continue the food distribution programme for the most deprived persons in 2012-2013, that is, to the end of the current funding period. During the debate on the future of the programme, the Parliament repeatedly expressed its strong support for the continuation of food aid during the next funding period. In the resolution adopted on 7 July 2011, we called on the Commission and the Council to find a way of continuing the MDP scheme for the new funding period 2014-2020 on a legal basis that cannot be contested by the Court of Justice of the European Union, maintaining the EUR 500 million annual financial ceiling so as to ensure that people dependent on food aid will not suffer from food poverty.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to remind you that before our vote on 15 February, Commissioner Andor, speaking on behalf of the European Commission, responded to a question asked by Ms Berès, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, relating to the future of the scheme during the new funding period. In his answer, Commissioner Andor stated that during the next funding period, the food distribution programme should be financed under the heading of the first budget, since placing it there, in the Commissioner’s opinion, would best serve the objective of the Europe 2020 strategy, which is to reduce poverty. The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission would, at the appropriate moment, use its right of legislative initiative and introduce the matter of the programme’s future into budget negotiations.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Parliament regards this declaration as a clear message. The Commissioner’s statement is particularly significant in the light of the European Commission’s non-binding declaration of 6 December 2011. This declaration, issued under pressure from the programme’s opponents while attempting to reach a compromise in the Council as regards the programme’s future in 2012-2013, states that the Commission is taking into account the opinion of a significant number of Member States which believe that the programme should not be continued after 2013, without prejudice to the right to legislative initiative enshrined in the Treaty. The Commission will take into account strong opposition to any legislative or financial proposal for the programme’s future. Although this declaration is not legally binding, there is still …</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, as Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I and Mr De Castro, who chairs the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, wished to raise this topic again here in plenary, partly in the light of the initial declarations made on behalf of the whole College of Commissioners on 15 February, in which it was stated that the Commission intended to use its exclusive right of initiative to bring a proposal back to the negotiating table whereby this programme could be funded under the next financial framework.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As you know, you will have Parliament’s full support for such an initiative; however, we are asking you to go further. We feel that this programme must not be held ransom to intergovernmental talks on the common agricultural policy, nor should we subject it too literally to European Court of Justice judgments without reclaiming the legislative initiative. We are therefore calling for this programme to be a genuine solidarity programme; in other words, it should not be a burden on the European Social Fund. Otherwise, as I have already said, we will be using the poor to organise solidarity for the poor. That is not what we need.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Lastly Commissioner, I would like to draw your attention to another matter: many people in this Parliament do not support macro-economic conditionality – you will never have our support for that – but do support subject-related conditionality and concentration on specific subjects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to combat poverty and social exclusion. This provides all the legitimate basis we need for funding aid to the most deprived out of the EU budget. We ask you to strive for this, and to try to bring on board the Member States that are dismissing this call. Instead of counting them on a list, why not persuade them, and use your exclusive right of initiative as a means of prodding them along?</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, first of all, I want to say that I welcome the Commission’s proposals for transitional measures to ensure the continuation of food aid to the most deprived persons in the Union. Currently, food aid is being provided to 13 million people suffering from poverty in 19 Member States.</p>
      <p sl="de">At one level, this indicates how far we have to go in alleviating poverty and the huge challenges we still face. While the provision of food aid itself is certainly not sufficient to alleviate poverty, it can be one piece of the jigsaw, and indeed for those who receive food aid, it is an essential piece.</p>
      <p sl="de">I agree with Commissioner Rehn that those who are likely to suffer from poverty expect a certain level of solidarity from the EU, and while I heard his positive comments about the European Globalisation Fund, unfortunately, his views are not shared by many Member States. I see that eight Member States have voted to scrap this fund or have said that we should do so. So, while there is Commission support and Parliament support for the continuation of this fund, this same level of support is certainly not forthcoming at Council level.</p>
      <p sl="de">It also seems that this programme we are discussing this morning is running into some difficulty with the Council and it certainly begs the broader question about the future of social policy. We are all aware that one of the five priorities of the EU 2020 strategy is to reduce poverty. Hopefully, the Commission will support Parliament in that. Commissioner, you will certainly get the support of this House for that programme.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we have managed to make sure that the food programme did not abruptly stop for the 18 million poorest Europeans who depend on it. It is continuing for this year and for next year.</p>
      <p sl="en">We now have no time to lose in giving food banks clarity about the future after that. My worst nightmare scenario is that we continue giving food banks the idea that the programme will go on after 2014, only to discover – much too late – that it will not. If we do not give clarity now, food banks will not take the necessary steps to become independent of EU food aid.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am pretty sure that a majority can be found in this House to continue direct food aid in some form, but I am equally sure that there will be a majority in Council to block this and that there are even countries ready to go to court over it. Can the Commissioner confirm that a deal made in Council means that the programme could continue for two years, but on the explicit condition that it will stop after that? Can he also tell us whether there is a foolproof way to get around this Council blockade or whether the strategy is to propose something in the cohesion policy and then just hope for the best? Because if hoping for the best is all the certainty that we can offer food banks, I think we are doing the poorest people in Europe a disservice if we do not say very soon that the programme will stop giving direct food aid in 2014 so that they will have at least some time to adapt to the future.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Rehn, ladies and gentlemen, if I have understood you correctly, Mr Rehn, what you have said today is that the Commission is fighting to ensure the continuation of the food programme for the most deprived people in the European Union. It will do everything in its power to put concrete proposals on the table in the near future concerning where exactly the programme will be based and how it will be financed.</p>
      <p sl="de">I believe that this is urgently needed and I think that we have a joint responsibility to ensure that the food programme becomes reality. This is not because I see it as a last resort, but because from my perspective, it sends out a signal that we still have a fundamental sense of solidarity with the day-to-day lives of those people in the European Union who, unfortunately, are not able to take part in any of the developments going on around them and who have become the first and most serious victims of the methods used by the European Union to combat the crisis. I am thinking about Greece, Spain and other countries where the measures that the European Union is taking are having the greatest impact on the poorest of the poor. We are sending out a signal but, unfortunately, it is no more than that. Therefore, I think we urgently need to put combating poverty at the top of our main agenda, and not just for the sake of the 18 million people in the European Union who are currently dependent on food aid. Until now, we have not sent out a clear enough signal. However, in my view, this is the decisive point if we want to continue to make progress and if we want the citizens of the European Union to have confidence in us to create a social Union with a strong sense of solidarity. In this respect, you have our support. However, ladies and gentlemen, we are also called upon to ensure that the governments which are currently blocking this programme adopt a different attitude. This is a personal commitment that we must make.</p>

      <p sl="lt">Mr President, rising food prices and the increasing cost of living are causing more and more people to seek help. The food aid scheme has been allocated EUR 113 million in 2012. This amount is lower than the previous amount of EUR 500 million. This scheme has reduced the food insecurity of the most deprived persons in the Union. An estimated 43 million people in the European Union are at risk of food poverty, meaning that they cannot afford a proper meal every second day. Many charities and non-governmental organisations around the EU recognise the importance of this programme and its special significance. We therefore need to find a way of continuing this programme without reducing its funding. I have to point out that in Lithuania, social tension is increasing due to dramatically increasing food and heating costs. The reduction in funding for this scheme will further exacerbate the situation for poor and vulnerable families.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the beneficiaries of the European Union’s food aid programme include not only the poor to whom food is distributed, but also those corporations and enterprises that obtain these enormous sums via public procurement procedures. It is not without relevance who these companies are. I urge my fellow Members to investigate to whom these sums are distributed in their own Member States. I did, and the results were quite shocking. Hungary received an amount of almost HUF 4 billion in food aid, and a considerable portion of that money was distributed among enormous corporate giants rather than small and medium-sized enterprises. To give you just a few figures, Gyermely Zrt. received HUF 660 million, and Diamant Zrt. HUF 333 million. Both corporations, by the way, belong to a group of companies on which serious fines had been imposed for their prior involvement in cartel activities.</p>
      <p sl="hu">What interest could a Member State have in distributing these public funds among such corporate giants while what we actually say is that we support SMEs? It would be quite welcome if no Member State of the European Union made smallholders and SMEs feel that if they are not close to those in power, both politically and economically speaking, then they can only be losers, as is the case, for example, with those Hungarian farmers who are losing access to state lands in tender procedures because those, too, can only be awarded to friends, pals and cronies, just like these enormous food aid funds.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 18 million people in Europe depend on this programme, and 43 million European citizens are at risk of poverty.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to thank Mr Siekierski and the other Members of Parliament who worked on the two committees responsible for producing this report, but I must start by pointing out that we reject the Commission’s proposal regarding the provisional nature of the aid. We will vote in favour of the programme as it has been drawn up, but we hereby reject in the House the concept that agreement was reached at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 14 and 15 December solely on the basis of a commitment to abandon the programme after this two-year period. Today’s vote is a positive vote, and tomorrow this will become a commitment to continue the programme. Among other things, the multiannual financial framework includes a reserve of EUR 2.5 billion for the 2014-2019 programmes under the Social Affairs heading.</p>
      <p sl="it">There is therefore nothing to stop the Commission from following up the projections in the multiannual financial framework and confirming its intention to continue the measure. Too much of Europe is dependent on this programme. There is a great need for aid at the moment, and Europe cannot tackle the crisis with cuts and taxes, creating deprivation in government budgets and taking away aid from the poor. It is a short-sighted and blind policy that we cannot support. Today, therefore, we will approve this programme, but from tomorrow, we will fight for it to continue beyond 2014.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to express my delight in the fact that we have achieved the highly important goal of extending the programme for food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Union to 2013.</p>
      <p sl="it">It has been a long and difficult process, involving the efforts of all of Parliament. Now, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have together urged the Commission to make a clear commitment to the European Parliament to pursue the programme after 2013. The statement of 6 December 2011 in which the Commission acknowledged the opposition of some Member States to a new programme must not prejudice the Commission’s right to legislative initiative as provided for by the Treaty. The Commission must take into account the strong desire on the part of the European Parliament and the vast majority of EU Member States to continue this programme. Therefore, we are pleased with the statements the Commission has made to us today.</p>
      <p sl="it">We are talking – let us reiterate this – about an instrument which allows the EU to distribute 440 000 tonnes of free food every year to over 18 million poor people and struggling families, a number which, unfortunately, also includes many children. This is why we cannot consider our political initiative to be over.</p>
      <p sl="it">Mr President, Commissioner, taking into consideration also the new global challenges, such as food security, which are making life even tougher for the disadvantaged, Parliament will do its best to ensure that differences are overcome and that the programme can continue in 2014.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, this programme was set up at a time when there were groaning food mountains around Europe. That, thankfully, is no longer the case. Today, the stores are empty, and the Commission is buying food off the market to supply the neediest in our society. The European Court of Justice, of course, has now ruled against this practice. Therefore, we need to find another way forward.</p>
      <p sl="en">My party believes that the Member States’ welfare systems are the most appropriate way of helping the most deprived people in our society, and that view is shared by some Member States and the Council. However, I recognise that there is a majority in this House in favour of continuing the programme at EU level. The CAP, however, is no longer the right tool to deliver the programme for the future, and that is why I support the proposal by the Commission that, in the next MFF, they will use the European Social Fund as a legal basis for the continuation of this important programme. It is in line with the ECJ ruling, it offers national flexibility and – most importantly – it ensures continued support to some of our poorest citizens.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, in its proposal for a regulation covering all the Structural Funds, the Commission has earmarked a budget of EUR 2.5 billion for a future food aid scheme for the most needy for 2014-2020, despite fierce opposition from a minority of Member States within the Council. This is a brave decision by the Commission and one which is in line with the wishes of the European Parliament, but, more importantly, with those of most of our fellow citizens. This is at a time when, with the worsening of the social crisis, increasing numbers throughout Europe are calling upon help from food banks.</p>
      <p sl="fr">It is a brave decision, but it is not enough. At present, the food aid programme for the most deprived is worth EUR 500 million per year. By proposing a budget of EUR 2.5 billion over seven years, the Commission has consciously reduced this budget by EUR 1 billion, even though the demand is continuously increasing.</p>
      <p sl="fr">In addition, we know nothing of the Commission’s intentions in terms of how the future programme will be introduced. If the funds are allocated within the framework of the European Social Fund, it will be difficult to continue buying food on the agricultural markets to distribute it to the most deprived because of the way in which the social fund is managed, especially since this practice has been condemned by the European Court of Justice. However, if no solution is found, the food banks will find themselves in a situation that they have managed to avoid until now.</p>
      <p sl="fr">What do you actually intend to do?</p>
      <p sl="fr">I, for one, believe it is necessary to maintain a decent budget for this programme and to ensure that each and every one of us, especially the most deprived, has the right to healthy food at an affordable price. Lastly, I believe an effective safety net is needed, as is a strong framework directive on a minimum income.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry that you have not really announced any specific, concrete action. From what you have said, we can just about make out that you intend to make a hole in the European Social Fund, but without increasing it.</p>
      <p sl="fr">If you put EUR 2.5 billion into a special multiannual programme for this sector, that means a reduction of EUR 100 million in the sum allocated each year for food aid, whether we like it or not. We cannot accept the situation under these conditions.</p>
      <p sl="fr">I therefore propose that the European Commission and Parliament, perhaps with the help of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, take the initiative of organising a hearing or joint meeting with social support organisations in Europe, so that we can properly assess the needs, work out how much money is required and come up with a joint proposal that can then be debated, along with the whole legal framework.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, I listened carefully to what you had to say. You are proposing that the food aid programme for the most deprived should be funded under the European Social Fund (ESF). Commissioner, I would like to point out that the ESF is primarily intended to help people get into employment, which is an absolutely vital step on the way towards social inclusion. Social inclusion will not come about unless people’s employment prospects improve. We must not take our eye off the ball on this subject. We must continue to be very attentive and proactive on getting people into employment.</p>
      <p sl="fr">As regards the food aid programme for the most deprived, I agree that the sums that we have allocated up to now – EUR 500 million per year – should be maintained so that the scheme can continue on a solid footing through to 2020. I also agree that you will need to convince those countries that are holding back at the moment. However, we cannot allow the conditionality clause on proper management to be attached to social affairs, as this would amount to penalising the scheme twice. I want you to know that we need this programme and that it has a great deal of support. It is your responsibility to keep it going.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, we have said this on many occasions in this House, for example, during the debates on my report on the platform against poverty: if we do not send out messages of solidarity to our citizens, letting them know that the European Union is standing by them, then disenchantment with the European project will grow, with the risk of isolation which that entails.</p>
      <p sl="fr">We all know that there is a blocking minority in the Council that will stop this kind of initiative in its tracks. The food aid programme is not the only programme to be in this situation, as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also under threat. However, if you exercise your right of initiative in order to save these programmes, which are so important, and make them genuine ongoing programmes of solidarity, in spite of present opposition within the Council, then that would send out the kind of message that Europe’s citizens are waiting for.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, we have genuine agreement across all the groups on this point and this will enable us to convince the countries which have so far been opposed to the programme. It is our job, naturally out of a sense of solidarity with the 18 million people who rely on it, to ensure that this programme continues. However, it must be given on a new basis. That is clear to all of us here. As Mr Lyon has already mentioned, the surpluses from European agricultural policy no longer exist. Therefore, we need to find a new foundation as quickly as possible which will allow us to establish a new distribution system, taking into consideration the court judgments.</p>
      <p sl="de">I am of the opinion that we need to strengthen the existing regional initiatives responsible for handing out and for distributing food. We also need to include food banks in the supply network. In addition, we must provide security. We must not find ourselves in the same situation as last time, when we just managed to save a fund for two years. Now we have been talking about it for two years and we still do not know what will happen next. The people who are reliant on aid urgently need security, not just for a period of years, but in the form of a long-term programme.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Mr President, the social condition of poverty is unacceptable in today’s European Union. In 2010, about 23.4% of the population, or 115 million people, were at risk of poverty and this risk is still present, even for workers in employment. According to Eurostat itself, this risk of poverty is closely linked to situations of poorly paid and poorly qualified employment, to jobs with no stability, and to part-time work.</p>
      <p sl="pt">The so-called budget consolidation measures approved in this Chamber will certainly exacerbate the situation even more. No proposal can therefore be acceptable if, at such a difficult time, it deprives people and workers of the food aid that guarantees them a minimum standard of living and guarantees their right not to live in food poverty. It is obvious to us that if the annual EUR 500 million of funding is not at least maintained – and it would be desirable to see it increased – then the wished-for spirit of solidarity of the European Union will be even more compromised.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, through the assistance of the European Union, food banks have been carrying out notable and recognised social work, which must continue in the future with the full support of Parliament.</p>

Eighty million people are below the poverty line and 43 million people have to weigh up whether to include protein in their diet twice a week.

      <p sl="es">Ladies and gentlemen, as Members of this Parliament, we must encourage any initiatives to continue the food aid programme in 2014, and throughout the coming financial perspective period. The European Parliament has to forge an agreement with the Council and avoid selfishness at all costs in favour of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, the agreement which has been reached following the interinstitutional negotiations was to retain the food distribution programme for the most deprived persons with the same funding in the EU budget up to 2013. However, some Member States have regrettably advocated abolishing this mechanism completely from this year.</p>
      <p sl="ro">More than 18 million European citizens have received food provided by the food distribution programme for the most deprived persons and 80 million Europeans live below the poverty line. I would just like to stress one key point. We also have hunger and poverty in the European Union, and we cannot ignore this reality which has been exacerbated by the economic crisis. The figures mentioned above highlight how much this programme needs to be continued in the future as well. It would be inhumane to abandon this programme during a period which is looking increasingly difficult. Poverty will not disappear in 2013. This is why we need this programme to continue after this year as well. It must continue to be a European programme, as it has been right from the time it was set up, and enjoy the same funding as it has hitherto.</p>
      <p sl="ro">This is why I am asking the Commission to determine where it will actually be possible to include this in the future multiannual financial framework. However, I am strongly against any attempt to impose national cofinancing. The discussions on the future multiannual financial framework are already under way at the moment, but the continuation of this programme is still not being discussed publicly. I would like to ask the Commission to guarantee that this programme will not be completely overlooked in the discussions outlining the new multiannual financial framework.</p>

      <p sl="es">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have to look at the source and cause of this problem. It is the current neoliberal economic model that many Member States are applying, with strategies based on budgetary adjustments but with a lack of active policies to generate growth and employment, which, coupled with the imbalance between the public and private sectors, has led to many of our citizens, who are not responsible for the crisis, falling into a vortex of hunger, poverty and social exclusion.</p>
      <p sl="es">The figures are not optimistic given that over 113 million European citizens are at risk of falling into poverty or becoming socially excluded.</p>
      <p sl="es">Solidarity and cohesion, basic European principles, show the need for these policies to be corrected through the regulation of economic relationships to avoid the widening of social differences and to put an end to the imbalances.</p>
      <p sl="es">The Union has to be there for its citizens, for those citizens who are suffering the most, with effective responses to exit this crisis. That is the only way the European institutions will recover their lost prestige. This enforces the need, therefore, to maintain this food distribution programme.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, firstly, I welcome Parliament’s support for the programme. As you know, EUR 2.5 billion has been proposed by the Commission in the next multiannual financial framework. The Commission does indeed have the intention to exercise its right of initiative. I agree that food assistance forms part of our wider efforts to fight poverty in society and, most likely, this can only be accepted if it is part of a coherent set of instruments to promote social inclusion and, in particular, instruments that will be financed from the European Social Fund.</p>
      <p sl="en">In response to Ms Cornelissen and several other honourable Members, I want to say that we do indeed want to fight for food assistance to be continued in the future too, as we have proposed, but we are aware that either an agreement or a definitive rejection has to be known early enough for food banks and charity organisations to be able to adapt to the decision.</p>
      <p sl="en">To those who ask why we should have this programme, our answer is that, at a time when we have very concrete and commonly agreed targets for employment and for the fight against poverty, the European Union simply cannot ignore the fact that more than 43 million Europeans cannot afford a meal with protein every second day, and that over seven million of our children do not have three meals a day simply because their parents are too poor. In the face of this reality, European solidarity cannot just be seen as an ideal, but becomes instead a moral imperative.</p>

Against the backdrop of the current general crisis, allocating additional funds to help those in need is a positive gesture. I should mention at this point one of the principles of the new programme: priority must be given to products of EU origin. This means that purchasing the food included in the programme directly from the market also boosts the European economy. I should emphasise the importance of cooperating with the non-governmental sector so as to prepare the food stocks required in good time. At the same time, I welcome the transfer of food storage costs to charitable organisations.

      <p sl="ro">The European Union is not making enough effort to address the basic needs of its citizens who have been hit hard by the economic crisis we are going through. We are devising comprehensive strategies for combating poverty and social exclusion, which we are then renaming to hide our inability to achieve a genuine, visible improvement in living conditions. European leaders are overly concerned about bailing out the banking system while the level of poverty in Europe rises. Let us not forget that an important target of the Europe 2020 strategy is to achieve by 2020 a minimum reduction of 20 million in the number of people stricken by poverty. In this context, it is disappointing that a number of Member States have chosen to oppose continuing to provide support to the most deprived citizens from the common agricultural policy budget. I welcome the fact that the negotiations have been kick-started and that the programme will be continued until the end of 2013, which is the outcome of the efforts made by the Commission and the European Parliament. However, I would like, at the same time, to express the hope that 2013 will not mark the expiry date for solidarity with the most vulnerable.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The right to food is a fundamental right that every person must enjoy. The European programme for deprived persons has helped achieve social policy objectives, in addition to fulfilling its agricultural aspect as part of the common agricultural policy. The programme has proved to be an important instrument for certain groups of people affected by poverty, especially against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis. I welcome the fact that this programme will continue this year because, in Romania alone in 2011, NGOs provided assistance to more than 2.8 million people on very low incomes. However, in my view, it is paramount that this aid also continues in the future. I think that the EU needs to provide support to deprived persons at a comparable level to this year as people in need still have to be given assistance. The Member States which oppose this measure must prove that they understand the situation of the poverty-stricken groups and agree to continue the programme under the necessary conditions. This is why I believe that this aid programme must be included in the European Social Fund and is a show of solidarity with all European citizens in need of support.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Six months ago, we discussed the ‘Food for Free’ programme in Parliament. It was unacceptable to have a properly functioning programme blocked by a group of states. The programme is perhaps more important today than at any time in the past. Food stocks are at an all-time low, the number of deprived people has risen due to the crisis – and I am afraid it will grow further – and food prices are also rising to dizzying heights. The programme must therefore be strengthened and its budget increased. The Commission, after all, suggested the same thing. Food is now harder to obtain from surplus stocks than at the start of the programme. It now has to be purchased on the open market, which is understandably more expensive. I am pleased that, thanks in part to the European Parliament, the dispute over the continuation of the programme has been resolved. Member States have received guarantees that the programme will be efficient and that as much money as possible will go towards purchasing food, and as little as possible towards related expenditure such as distribution and administration. The example from Slovakia shows that the distribution of flour was not entirely without problems, although this is not a reason to suspend the programmes but to make it more efficient. It is important for the programme to be further legitimised and popularised, as it is only in force for two years in its current form. A decision will then be taken on it again. I would hate to see a repeat of what happened last year.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Food aid to the most deprived citizens is a successful EU programme. Every year, it distributes thousands of tonnes of basic foodstuffs, such as flour and sugar, among those in need.

Yet the future of the programme is in jeopardy, as some Member States intend to make cuts in the EU budget and, to that end, wish to terminate food aid. We find this unacceptable. Due to the protracted economic crisis, there is an increasingly strong necessity to support European citizens in need.

However, a distinction needs to be made between the two groups. The intention behind the ESF and EGF is obviously to provide long-term solutions. On the other hand, food aid programmes address the needs for immediate intervention and are targeted at the most vulnerable groups of European citizens.</p>

      <p sl="pl">In our country, the aid programme for poor people works well and involves some 20 000 volunteers, 7 000 non-governmental organisations, Food Banks and the charity Caritas. There are many needy people in Poland, with two million people only able to meet their basic needs and five million in very difficult living conditions. In Poland today, four million people benefit from the food aid programme. They receive food products such as flour, grain and tinned goods, with 21 different types of product provided in 2011. It is worth noting that the food aid programme brings benefits in several areas. In addition to providing support for people at risk of poverty and social exclusion, it makes an important contribution to farmers’ incomes and the agri-food sector. For these reasons, EU food aid for deprived persons should be maintained.</p>

      <p sl="cs">In their resolution of 7 July 2011 on the programme for distributing food to the most deprived persons in the Union, MEPs decided that the Commission should take steps to avoid a dramatic reduction in food aid in the EU. A sudden change in funding for the current, functioning programme, without prior warning or preparation, would have a major impact on the EU’s most vulnerable citizens. According to the Commission’s own estimates, 43 million people in the EU are at risk of a lack of food and, as a result of the economic and financial crisis and the sharp rise in food prices, this number may increase further. One of the five priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy is to limit poverty and social exclusion. I therefore very much welcome the Commission statement promising that the programme will also continue after 2014. The EU budget must continue to participate in funding this programme, despite some Member States requesting a reduction in the EU budget. The demand of some Member States to end the food support programme is, in my opinion, reckless, coming precisely at a time when the most deprived sectors of the population are acutely affected by a crisis that was not of their own making.</p>

I see no reason, therefore, why this food aid should be terminated now, when we are also facing major social problems. I therefore fully support the continuation of this programme.

      <p sl="hu">The European Parliament has preserved the EU food aid programme for the coming two-year period. As a result, Hungary will be granted more than HUF 4 billion from the EUR 500 million pool allocated to aid and can use that sum to support those in need. Last year alone, more than 3 500 tonnes of food were distributed to the most deprived citizens in Hungary thanks to the EU. This is particularly important to my country, where nearly one hundred thousand people are starving and a further 1 million are threatened by qualitative starvation. Amid the turmoil of the economic crisis and austerity measures, a projected 18 million citizens in 20 EU Member States will be in need of EU aid in 2012.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Italy, the largest beneficiary of food aid, receives an amount of nearly EUR 100 million from the Community funds. The debate should therefore not be about whether we are providing food aid under social or agricultural policy. The common agricultural policy has always covered a number of social aspects. It is our joint responsibility to act in the spirit of European solidarity to bring food to the needy in times of distress. At the same time, the food programme reinforces the reputation of the European Union, which is at an all time low. I therefore firmly call on the Member States that are opposed to the food programme and on the European Commission to not impede the EU ‘food fund’ in the future.

      <p sl="fr">EUR 500 million – one euro per citizen per year: that is the sum allocated by the EU to the food banks, Red Cross, Restaurants du Coeur and others. In Europe, 43 million people are affected by food poverty; 18 million needed help from the food aid programme for the most deprived in 2011 and 80 million people on our continent are living below the poverty line. For many European citizens, the question is no longer ‘what are we going to eat?’ but ‘are we going to eat?’. Through its spokesperson, Dacian Cioloş, the European Commission has proposed bringing the food aid programme for the most deprived under the umbrella of the economic and social cohesion policy from 2014 onwards. However, in the light of Germany’s announcement that it refuses to let Europe engage in social policy, there is cause for concern. In any case, the Belgian socialists consider it out of the question that this agreement should be a pretext for stopping European social support from 2014 onwards. It is important that we find a solution. We will be monitoring the situation to ensure that a new system is put in place for 2014 and beyond, in order to guarantee greater social cohesion and to prevent millions of people in Europe from sinking into outright starvation. Europe must show solidarity or it will cease to exist.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The poverty figures for the European Union are devastating, with the middle classes falling into hidden poverty and the risk of social exclusion. In 2010, about 115 million people in the European Union were below the poverty line, equivalent to 23.4% of the population of Europe. This situation requires the Member States to introduce social measures to support the most vulnerable, namely, children and the elderly. The effects of austerity have led to high unemployment rates, making it impossible to raise living standards in the Member States. Public policies are needed to support food distribution and to bring an end to wastage of food in restaurants and public canteens. At EU level, moreover, the Union must not only implement sectoral policies, particularly cohesion policy, but must also continue to support the food aid programme, which uses food surpluses to benefit 13 million people. I therefore consider it important that the Member States do not cut support for this programme in the forthcoming multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The food distribution programme for the most deprived persons was established by Regulation (EC) No 3730/1987. During the time it has been in operation, for more than 20 years, the programme has helped not only reduce poverty and implement EU social policy, but also meet objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP), as well as bring stability to the markets and ensure affordable prices for the products supplied to consumers. Unfortunately, some Member States have called for the funding for this programme from the CAP to be stopped. However, the Commission has suggested that the programme continues through the CAP during the 2012-2013 period to the tune of EUR 500 million per year, a proposal approved by the European Parliament and EU Council. Every year, the programme has contributed to distributing approximately 440 000 tonnes of food to 18 million deprived people from 19 Member States. We call for the programme to continue after 2013 as well and urge the Commission to integrate it properly into the future multiannual financial framework so that it can continue to help meet both the EU’s social objectives and the CAP’s objectives. I do not think it is appropriate to fund the programme solely from the European Social Fund as it would mean reducing the funds allocated to other social measures for tackling poverty and increasing social inclusion.</p>

      <p sl="de">Combating poverty is an important objective of European policy during this decade. The European Union has undertaken to reduce poverty levels significantly by 2020, by coordinating current policies more effectively and by setting concrete goals. Alongside a series of other measures, the EU ‘Food for Free’ programme has become an important tool for overcoming poverty. In an area which actually comes under the authority of the Member States, it has been possible to help people who would otherwise have gone hungry by using resources from the agriculture industry. This important assistance, which directly benefits those affected and which has therefore also been able to convince a large number of people of the importance of the European project, is now likely to come to an end, as a result of disputes about responsibility and the opposition of some Member States. This will not only result in a serious reduction in the amount of food available to those sections of the population which are at risk of poverty and exclusion, but also to a further loss of credibility in the progress being made in Europe. We must therefore call on the Commission to find appropriate ways of continuing this programme.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Europe 2020 strategy quite rightly states that one of the Union’s development priorities is a reduction in the number of people living in poverty and social exclusion. The aim is for the number of people at risk of poverty to fall by 20 million by 2020. In this context, I believe that it is important to continue food distribution, financed from EU funds, to needy people in the European Union. At present, EUR 500 million is spent on this scheme from the EU budget each year, and 18 million people benefit from this aid. Polish citizens are key beneficiaries of this scheme, since four million people receive assistance in the form of free food products, including staples such as grains, flour and tinned foods. Over 20 000 volunteers and many non-governmental organisations are involved in programmes to help the poor in Poland. It should be noted that implementation of the EU programme does not just provide tangible support for many poor people but is also important for agricultural producers, for farmers’ incomes and for agri-food processing companies. All of this argues in favour of the EU continuing this programme and funding it from its budget.</p>

      <p sl="unknown">The next item is the report by Iliana Ivanova, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the European Investment Bank (EIB) – annual report 2010 (2011/2186(INI)) (A7-0058/2012).</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Hoyer on his new post and say that I hope he continues the excellent cooperation between the EIB and the European Parliament.</p>
      <p sl="en">The European Union is going through the most difficult period in its history. Yesterday, the ECB again expressed its disappointment at the low growth levels and the lower than expected business crediting. At the same time, unemployment rates are greatly increasing in most of our Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">In addition to these factors, Europe also faces important external challenges, such as climate change, energy issues and democratic changes in neighbouring countries. That is why the EU needs this strong institution and I welcome the European Investment Bank’s strong commitment to taking a leading role in reviving the European economy.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the 2010 annual report, I emphasised several important issues that addressed these challenges. The first critical point for me is support for small and medium-sized enterprises. I am convinced that a well-functioning real economy, and SMEs in particular, should be the engine that will boost the EU economic recovery.</p>
      <p sl="en">The EIB group ensures significant support for SMEs across Europe through its different instruments. Nevertheless, there are still areas that could be improved. First, enhanced transparency in the way that the EIB selects financial intermediaries and allocates global loans. A lot has been done in recent years, but the system of providing this type of financial assistance still needs to be improved. We need clear performance indicators and targets as well as better supervision of financial intermediaries in order to assess the effectiveness of these programmes. It is clear that the final results cannot be properly assessed without adequate and explicit targets. I hope that President Hoyer will address these issues with even better responsiveness than the EIB has demonstrated so far.</p>
      <p sl="en">The second important point concerns external policy. Even though we recently increased the financial envelope for external affairs, from the budgetary control standpoint, there are still some concerns. There is insufficient information about the results, the impact and the achievements of this policy. The information on the quality of the sub-project’s finances, and consequently the final beneficiaries’ performance, does not provide sufficient assurance that the desired objectives are being achieved. I believe that these points are essential. The European guarantee to the EIB operations outside the EU represents a potential liability for the EU budget and we need to see efficient monitoring tools that show the real value-added of the finance project.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, I want to stress my concerns regarding the issues related to internal control mechanisms. I am concerned about the increase of the overall level of credit risk in the Bank’s loan portfolio. It is clear that this is a result of growing pressures on the creditworthiness of existing counterparties and the higher risk embedded in new operations.</p>
      <p sl="en">The capital adequacy ratio decreases more and more each year. I wonder how the risk management philosophy of the EIB is addressing these challenges. When targeting beneficiaries, it is important to consider seriously their creditworthiness and to actually think of instruments that would encourage and help countries with good financial discipline. We need to give good students a boost as well, and I expect the EIB to take this recommendation on board.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to emphasise the fact that the AAA credit rating of the bank represents the cornerstone of its activity and is essential for its operations. In this respect, the EIB should take all necessary steps to preserve this rating.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would again like to thank President Hoyer for his cooperation, as well as for the excellent communication we have had with the Brussels representation of the EIB.</p>

    <intervention id="4-053-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Werner Hoyer" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="President of the European Investment Bank">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is a pleasure and an honour for me to be here for the first time in my new capacity and to respond to the report just given by Ms Ivanova. It is a real pleasure because I believe that the cooperation between our Bank and the European Parliament should be clear, should be open and should be transparent. I consider the European Parliament an ally of the Bank in the enormous challenges which we will have to meet in the future.</p>
      <p sl="en">Allow me first of all to thank Iliana Ivanova for her very thorough and diligent report and for her excellent cooperation with the EIB’s services. We welcome the fact that even though the report has the year 2010 in the title, it not only looks at the past but also examines matters from a broader perspective and addresses some very recent developments, as well as some key orientations for the future. We share the analyses for the current situation and the challenge the European Investment Bank is facing nowadays. Much emphasis has been put on fiscal consolidation – understandably so given the state of finances in many Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Across the continent, we have realised that solid public finances are key to regaining market confidence. However, tackling the problem of public debt and fiscal consolidation is only part of the equation. The other part is restoring sustainable growth, boosting job creation and stimulating competitiveness to ensure the EU maintains its position in a world economy that is now globalising at high speed.</p>
      <p sl="en">This job-friendly growth – as the Heads of State or Government put it at the Council meeting in January – must be pursued in parallel with fiscal consolidation and this is, as you are aware, where the EIB comes into play. It comes into play with long-term investment in key drivers of economic expansion. I welcome your backing for our commitment to focus on the knowledge triangle of research and development, innovation and education. Indeed, investment in that area is vital for Europe if it does not want to be sidelined by new actors in the global game.</p>
      <p sl="en">You will be aware that, since 2008, the EIB has, on request by the Member States, and as a timely targeted temporary measure, extended extraordinary lending volumes in support of growth and jobs. Last year, the Bank provided its highest ever contribution to the real economy: some EUR 60 billion actually disbursed to clients at favourable conditions and long tenors. However, this has brought us to a limit, and this was clear from the beginning. This is because the EIB does not spend taxpayers’ money but obtains all the resources it needs for lending by borrowing on the markets – EUR 76 billion last year, almost half of which was from countries outside the European Union which, by the way, is also an indication of trust and confidence in the European Union.</p>
      <p sl="en">This gradual decrease which we now have in the operation plan was planned, foreseen and necessary for us to protect the financial strength of the Bank and retain the full confidence of our investors. However, it is definitely not satisfactory; I agree with that as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">So how do we reconcile this decrease in lending volumes with the request from our shareholders to, as it is said, strengthen support for SMEs and infrastructure and enhance action to support growth – to use the wording of the European Council meeting in January? How do we make sure that, in times of need, the EIB does not work pro-cyclically due to its capital constraints? Rather than reducing the number of projects, we have financed a lower proportion of projects – and, in practice, a constant number of projects – in order to maintain our impact across a wide spectrum of areas. We have also made sure not to withdraw from countries in need, as that would contradict our role.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are aware that the current economic climate and budgetary shortfalls mean that we must find ways to do more with less. Combining EU budget funds with EIB resources, risk sharing and guarantees for financing mechanisms is one way of achieving this. However, at the end of the day, we have come to the conclusion that the overall lending capacity of the EIB remains constrained by its very capital base. This means there are limits to what these risk sharing instruments can achieve.</p>
      <p sl="en">A conventional capital increase, as you mention in your report, would definitely be the most effective way to remedy that but so far, understandably, the readiness and willingness of Member States to boost our paid-in capital appears limited. Given these constraints, another way to construct capital support for the EIB would be to allow the EU to provide quasi capital.</p>
      <p sl="en">In the meantime, we continue to explore other alternatives in order to strengthen the Bank’s capital base so as to allow the Bank to do more. We do this while very clearly and precisely following best banking procedures and sticking to very basic principles which provide, or which are the guarantee of, the preservation of the triple-A status of this Bank. This is essential for the business model of the Bank and the European Union Member States. The shareholders of the EIB should have a keen interest in the European Investment Bank, maintaining the balance – and this is the job of any bank – between risk orientation and preserving the good quality of the portfolio, in order to be able to maintain a high rating on the market, because that is the basis for our ability to borrow at very favourable rates and pass this on to the final beneficiary. That is the real economy, and that is where we must make a difference.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I find it particularly pertinent to assess the role of the European Investment Bank in the current economic context. I want to thank the rapporteur, Ms Ivanova, and the European Parliament, as well as President Werner Hoyer, for their very fruitful cooperation.</p>
      <p sl="en">Looking at the current state of the European economy, our most recent forecast projected that the European Union would go through a phase of mild recession or zero growth this year. While financial markets show some signs of stabilisation, there cannot be any room for complacency. We must continue with determination to conclude and implement our five-point road map for stability and growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">As the Bank of the European Union, the EIB plays a crucial role in Europe, and last year, the EIB supported projects of wide-ranging importance for the European economy with lending of EUR 54 billion.</p>
      <p sl="en">To promote the Europe 2020 strategy of jobs and growth and climate action, the Commission and the EIB have been developing innovative financial instruments, such as loan grant lending and risk sharing mechanisms. We welcome the support of Parliament. I would especially like to thank Parliament for its constructive approach to our legal proposal on the project bond pilot initiative and the urgency with which the file has been pursued.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since the Council was able to reach an agreement yesterday, I am confident that the legislative process can, and will be, concluded by the summer. The pilot phase should already be having a positive impact. When we tabled the proposal last October, we estimated the final multiplier effect to be at around 15 to 20 in terms of comparing the total effective amount of investment to the EU budget contribution. This is expected to mobilise investments of up to EUR 4.6 billion in the pilot phase 2012-2013.</p>
      <p sl="en">But we must also see the bigger picture. A successful pilot launch can lead to programmes being more widely used, especially in the Connecting Europe facility under the next financial framework. This can create a long-term incentive for capital market investors to invest in this specific project, thus mobilising further resources for sustainable growth and employment in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me also underline the important commitment the EIB has made and is making to support the economic recovery of Greece. Last week, the EIB signed an agreement with the Minister of Development of the Hellenic Republic to create a EUR 500 million guarantee fund which will provide a first-loss guarantee for EIB support of EUR 1 billion of SME lending by Greek banks for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="en">We are also responding to the January European Council’s call to strengthen EIB support in general in Europe for SMEs and infrastructure, not least in the other programme countries, and we are together considering possibilities for the EU budget to deliver the EIB groups’ financing capacity. I agree with President Hoyer that it is very important to look for creative and convincing ways of reinforcing the capital base of the EIB.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, the EIB provided EUR 7 billion of loans outside the EU, and we expect the EIB to focus its external activity on operations in the pre-accession countries, as well as in our eastern neighbours. It will make consistent contributions, with an emphasis on supporting the democratic and economic transformation in the southern Mediterranean in line with the revised mandate adopted by Parliament and the Council.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am convinced that Parliament’s assessment of the EIB’s activities in the year ahead will be as supportive as its opinion on the 2010 annual report and I am very much looking forward to a continued, close and successful cooperation between the Bank and the Commission.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, for my part, would like to welcome Mr Hoyer. It is the first time that he has been here and I hope we will have a fruitful cooperation. I want to focus on four matters: first of all, the call on the European Investment Bank to report regularly on its results, including notification of specific data on final beneficiaries. Mr Hoyer, what is your response to this specific request?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Secondly, the external mandate of the European Investment Bank – that is, operations outside the EU in the context of development cooperation – must be in full compliance with Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which stipulates that the reduction and eradication of poverty in developing countries are the main objectives of the development cooperation policy of the European Union. Focusing on this is, therefore, extremely important.</p>
      <p sl="nl">Thirdly, the European Investment Bank should ensure that compliance with all EU standards, but also with all international standards in the field of environmental protection, and in the fields of social and human rights, is a systematic condition for the provision of funding by the EIB. This means, therefore, that companies which violate these standards, or companies which are registered in tax havens, should not actually be eligible for EIB support. Mr Hoyer, what is your response to this demand by the European Parliament?</p>
      <p sl="nl">Finally, the fourth point, and a positive one, is that the EIB is focusing on combating climate change and that it is committed to renewable energy. In this regard, we say very loudly and clearly: EIB, concentrate on decentralised, small-scale and off-grid projects and, in this way, ensure that rural areas gain proper access to energy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would also like to welcome Mr Hoyer to the Parliament today and to congratulate him on his position.</p>
      <p sl="en">I would like to speak as the rapporteur on the opinion from the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. Cooperation in the committee was actually very good, as there was agreement on a number of principles. One was the principle of transparency and accountability, and not only to Member States – and I would like to see Member States take a more active role in ensuring accountability, particularly when, in theory, there is an unlimited call on capital for Member States which we have to be aware of during difficult times – but also to report regularly to the European Parliament. I know there has been a precedent set in the past. We also want to make sure that the best prudential banking practices are in place, because – let us not forget – it is European citizens who provide the money via their taxes. It is also important to have as much information as possible in the public domain so that citizens can make their choices.</p>
      <p sl="en">Of course, there are competing demands on the EIB. Like many banks, we are asking you to rebuild balance sheets, to have a strong balance sheet and to be able to be stress tested and to meet all the requirements. But, at the same time, we are also asking you to lend more money. I understand that balancing those two requirements is always a very difficult thing. But, given the lessons of the crisis, given the problems, and given the fact that the EIB relies on the ratings from the Member States, please make sure that you ensure that you have a strong balance sheet and actually are able to cope with the unexpected.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to welcome President Hoyer and the Commission and, as shadow rapporteur, I can only approve the fact that in 2010, the European Investment Bank (EIB) increased financing for climate action, energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport, forestation, and so on from the planned EUR 16 billion to EUR 19 billion.</p>
      <p sl="it">Another positive fact is that by increasing funding to EUR 6 billion in 2010 from the EUR 500 million of 2006, the EIB undoubtedly helped to promote renewable energy, which is a strategic area for EU climate issues. The improvement in technical input, with an increase in the number of experts working on energy efficiency programmes from 40% in 2007 to 64% in 2011, is also an extremely positive factor.</p>
      <p sl="it">However, there are two negative factors. The first is that the EIB needs to help small and medium-sized enterprises, and the second is that the EIB must not promote projects on prohibited technologies – oil, gas and minerals – which we hope can be gradually eliminated over time.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very warm welcome to you, President Hoyer. We are pleased that you are able to address us on such an important issue as the annual report now, as you are assuming office. We hope that you will be a frequent visitor. The new multiannual programmes give the European Investment Bank (EIB) a very important role. We hope that the EIB will work hard to redress the deficit in the areas you have just promised, namely, by increasing transparency. Again and again, we find that we know far too little about the costs charged to the EU by the EIB for managing the financial instruments. In other words, we would expressly ask that our questions and the points raised by Ms Ivanova in her report be answered.</p>
      <p sl="de">In the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have found that there is an increasing interest in the EIB among our colleagues. It is evident that many colleagues want to see a strong EIB. We also want the EIB to supply us with more information, however, providing hard facts and figures that go beyond the colourful photos and attractive brochures, so that we have a genuine insight into how funds are being managed at local level. We should never forget that yours is a relatively small institution. The EU is a relatively large organisation and it has more people on the ground than you do. In other words, the question for us is how you can do things better than the EU itself. Here, too, there is some catching up for you to do.</p>
      <p sl="de">I would like to point out that the capital base of the EIB cannot be allowed to increase by simply allowing you to take over parked Structural Fund resources, as I recently heard proposed by a party colleague of yours from Germany. We believe that the EIB is an important instrument as an adjunct to the EU and its key activities. That is why we want an efficient EIB, but not as an alternative for activity by the EU itself.</p>

      <p sl="cs">Mr President, as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&amp;D Group), I particularly welcome the wide-ranging support of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for so-called convergence regions, which accounted for almost 41% of overall EIB loans in the EU, and also the fact that almost 30% of the volume of EIB loans in 2010 involved projects directly contributing to greenhouse gas emission reductions.</p>
      <p sl="cs">I would like briefly to focus on four points. First, the responsibility of the EIB. In March this year, based on the opinion of our Committee on Budgetary Control, the European Parliament recommended introducing a system of prudential regulatory oversight of the EIB, either through the European Central Bank or the European Banking Authority, with the possible participation of an independent auditor.</p>
      <p sl="cs">The second point relates to the issues of offshore financial centres and tax havens. In the current situation of ongoing financial and economic crisis in particular, it is important to ensure that the EIB’s financial operations do not contribute to any form of tax evasion or even money laundering.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Thirdly, in view of the economic and financial crisis, we consider it necessary to provide a greater volume of loans for structural programmes supporting economic recovery and growth. In this context, it is essential that the EIB not only continues to offer similar instruments to countries in financial difficulty, but also that it provides substantial support for countries with good financial discipline and convergence regions. It is also very important for the EIB to draw up and implement a strategy aimed at preserving its AAA rating, which is the foundation of the bank’s operations.</p>
      <p sl="cs">Fourthly, I welcome the EIB’s approach to the idea of EU project bonds. I am also delighted that in October last year, the Commission finally submitted the relevant legislative proposal for an initiative which should begin in 2012-2013.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I would like to welcome the President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Werner Hoyer, and to congratulate him on his committed and convincing debut. Following monetary stabilisation, we must now focus fully on real growth in the economy. One of the key aspects of this is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. The EIB supported 115 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in 2010 with funds totalling EUR 10 billion. A credit squeeze nonetheless persists for medium-sized businesses, particularly in the crisis countries and on the periphery of the European Union. We in the European Parliament expect the EIB to do all it can to provide greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
      <p sl="de">We would be interested to learn more about the significance of the guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises and the options with regard to the Risk Sharing Finance Facility. We also believe it is important that the EIB should play a role in financing infrastructure in the context of the EU project bonds. In summary, we believe that infrastructure, technology and innovation – in short, blue growth – should be at the centre of EIB strategy.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Hoyer, congratulations on taking on your new and important, perhaps increasingly important, function. I would like firstly to emphasise that, in my view, as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, even more importantly, as a politician from a poor country, namely Poland, it is extremely important for the European Investment Bank to continue and to give much more priority to its assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises, which, in reality, represent the part of the economy in each country that enables us to weather the present crisis more successfully. Large firms have large problems, while small companies can be more flexible, but they deserve our support and assistance. You have supported 100 000 small companies, but that is too few, and EUR 10 billion is too little. I am calling for more to be done.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would also like to say that the European Investment Bank should be an investing bank, that is, a bank that expects a return on its investments. Investment projects cannot be ideological in nature. To be entirely honest, I have the impression that some of the projects that relate to combating global warming or reducing CO2 emissions appear to be driven more by ideology than by economic or financial considerations.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to start by welcoming the President of the European Investment Bank to plenary and to welcome the initiatives taken and work carried out by the Bank in combating the emergency caused by the crisis and the constant efforts being made to achieve social and economic cohesion and stability and growth in our neighbourhood.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to focus my attention on the need for complementarity between the resources of the European Investment Bank and the resources of the Structural Funds. We need to consider how we can combine the Bank’s activities with unused resources, so that we can offer venture capital and technical support to small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that our efforts should focus, on the one hand, on the sectors that give the European Union competitive advantages, such as the knowledge economy – and I welcome the efforts you have already made in that direction – and, on the other, on the countries which have been particularly hard hit by the crisis.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should like to welcome, in particular, the creation of the Guarantee Fund recently established in my country, Greece. It makes provision for soft loans totalling EUR 500 million to be channelled – via banks – to small and medium-sized enterprises. I should like to ask how you view its prospects and what direct action has already been planned in order to address the economic and social crisis in Greece and to kick-start the economy, which is something we badly need.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, we are facing an inescapable reality. The European Union cannot emerge from the recession it is going through just by applying austerity measures. It needs sound economic growth which is built on investment in research, development and infrastructure. In this context, the European Parliament is calling today on the governor of the EIB to approve a significant increase in the bank’s capital. We must take rapid action to encourage the development of sustainable industries and job creation.</p>
      <p sl="ro">I mentioned it already as part of the 2009 European Investment Bank report and I will reiterate the same idea again today. It is the European Commission’s duty to introduce bonds for funding projects as soon as possible, preferably prior to the 2014-2020 budget period.</p>
      <p sl="ro">Finally, I would like to point out that the EIB should give priority to investment projects in regions and Member States which are facing the biggest economic difficulties and the most serious liquidity problems.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, Mr Rehn, I wish to congratulate Werner Hoyer on his brilliant debut in his new job.</p>
      <p sl="de">Mr Hoyer, this is not an easy time for the European Union. This economic and financial crisis calls for adroit economic and political expertise. You have both in good measure. The European Parliament is happy to see you at the helm of the European Investment Bank (EIB). I would also like to thank the outgoing Vice-President, Matthias Kollatz-Ahnen, however, as he has also achieved a great deal. As an example, I would mention the establishment of the European Energy Efficiency Fund. Mr Hoyer, the role of your bank is decisive in overcoming the crisis. We are all aware of this. You have also proven this. I would cite the example of how you overcame the crisis in the automotive sector. Thanks to the scrapping premiums, which were mainly paid for by your bank, we managed to do something good for the environment, while also providing a stimulus for the economy.</p>
      <p sl="de">We are now facing new challenges. We have heard several references to the issue of project bonds. We are constantly talking about the innovative financial instruments we expect from your bank. We need clear rules, however; we expect your bank to issue clear rules for all Member States. We wish you every success in your efforts to obtain a triple-A rating for the bank. As stated in our report, for which I would like to thank Ms Ivanova, we would like to see the EU becoming a shareholder. This may perhaps be a step in the right direction. I wish you all the best for the work ahead.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, investing in infrastructure research and innovation is key to unlocking growth and increasing competitiveness, and the EIB has an important role to play. In my amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive, I have proposed that banks cofinancing long-dated infrastructure with the EIB should be able to drop their risk rating by 50%. However, the EIB relies on its guarantee – implied guarantee – from our Member States for its triple-A rating, and we do need improved transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Risk Sharing Finance Facility, loan guarantee facility and Eurostars programmes for SMEs appear to be under-utilised by certain Member States. These programmes can be overly bureaucratic when compared to national programmes, and we should look at this.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last year, I led negotiations for this Parliament on budgetary frameworks. It obliges countries to disclose off-balance sheet debts and contingent liabilities, and the project bond initiative must not be an excuse to hide new debts in complex arrangements between our Member States, the EU and the EIB. So the pilot schemes should be carefully monitored and assessed before a larger roll-out. Funds should be open to all and pricing must be fair. As MEPs, we all know of the infrastructure needs in our own countries. In my region, we need investment in broadband, electricity grids and key roads. If project bonds can unlock that investment without adding hidden leverage for our national taxpayers, then I will support them.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the European Investment Bank for almost doubling its level of activity and financial results during the last three years. I also wish to congratulate it for the way in which it devised its strategy for the 2011-2013 period. I once again welcome the fact that the future multiannual financial framework will also have the support of the European Investment Bank which, I hope, will play a much more significant role in the period ahead, both as a player in the economic recovery, but especially in the European Union’s sustainable economic development.</p>
      <p sl="ro">However, I believe that it is of paramount importance for us to encourage European Union Member States which have financial problems and are unable to cofinance projects from European funds to resort to support from the European Investment Bank. We should think about using those incentives to increase the take-up of European funds significantly and make it much more effective in Eastern European states, particularly because we need to use European funds efficiently.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I welcome the President of the EIB and indeed the good work the EIB is doing in trying to combat the crisis we are in at the minute, especially their loans to SMEs. However, I have a question for the President: how can he guarantee that the actual loans are being given to SMEs? In my country at least, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the banks are using them to balance their own books rather than giving them to SMEs. That is a very important point.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, I particularly welcome their role in combating climate change and in putting infrastructure in place, especially interconnectors and super grids, etc. That is absolutely vital. Thirdly, he mentioned the need for triple-A ratings, and we agree with that. I noticed that the EIB was put on negative credit watch at the end of 2011, but I have a difficulty here as I think those who are doing the ratings do not have a triple-A reputation themselves. This is either owing to their role in the financial crisis or to the recent timing of ratings prior to Council meetings, which could be seen as political interference. It would be much better if we introduced the reforms which we suggested here in Parliament a few months ago.</p>

      <p sl="sl">Mr President, I would like to welcome the annual report by the European Investment Bank, above all because, in 2010, the bank provided more than EUR 25 billion to European regions hardest hit by the economic crisis and, thereby, increased the volume of structural lending programmes.</p>
      <p sl="sl">It is essential that this practice continues in the future. The role such loans, risk-sharing instruments and project bonds may have in supporting public investments will be extremely important in the recovery of the European economy.</p>

      <p sl="it">However, I would like to highlight one point of the 2010 report which leaves me somewhat perplexed. I cannot understand how Turkey can be by far the biggest recipient of funding outside of the EU. A large part of European loans are, in fact, going to Turkish companies which are often in direct and unfair competition with our own businesses. From a political point of view, it is even more serious that a bank comprising the twenty-seven Member States should grant loans to a country that does not even recognise one of them, and that continues to threaten Europe regarding the imminent Cypriot Presidency.</p>
      <p sl="it">Therefore, I have tabled an amendment to freeze funding to Turkey until the Cyprus question has been resolved. I hope that Parliament will not look the other way today, but will take this important initiative seriously.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, when the word ‘bank’ is attached to an institution, it bestows on it a status of economic rationality and even professionalism, but the role of this institution is to pursue the objectives of the EU project.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2010, the Board of Directors declared that its activities had three main dimensions: the Commission’s Europe 2020 strategy with its employment strategy that embraces neoliberal economic policy and an acceptance of globalism; combating climate change – well, we had an 11th century Danish King of England who set himself a comparable task – and, thirdly, supporting the EU’s foreign policy objectives.</p>
      <p sl="en">This is yet another example of the fact that, whatever activity the EU is following, whatever institution we are looking at, or whatever ostensible objective it might have, the real objective is the European project, the creation of a European – or perhaps these days, not so very European – superstate.</p>

      <p sl="ro">Mr President, there is no doubt about the role played by the European Investment Bank in tackling the current economic and financial crisis or in achieving the 2020 strategy objectives. This is why I think that this institution must continue its efforts to support the European Union economy and promote economic, social and territorial cohesion, with a particular focus on projects targeted at the less developed regions.</p>
      <p sl="ro">It is of particular significance that in terms of lending volume, public-private partnership projects accounted in 2010 for 32% of the lending granted by the EIB to the trans-European transport networks. In a situation where public funding is becoming increasingly restricted, I think that channelling EIB investment into such projects will provide tangible support in supplementing the efforts made at local and regional level. These partnerships are crucial to the European Union being able to make the necessary investments in particular areas, such as infrastructure and the services sector. I suggest to the Commission that it should make specific improvements in strengthening the public-private partnership.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, after the financial and economic crisis erupted, it was widely expected that the European Investment Bank would support and ensure the continuity of many projects. In a number of areas, however, these expectations were not fulfilled, and in last year’s debate on the annual report for 2009, I pointed out that the anti-crisis funding which should have been channelled into these small and medium-sized enterprises in Eastern Europe had long been used mainly to boost the balance sheets of private commercial banks.</p>
      <p sl="sk">We expected that, in a time of crisis, the European Investment Bank would give priority to helping those areas most affected by the crisis. When we look at the distribution of loans last year, however, a specific picture emerges. While Germany got 10% of the overall amount, Greece got only 1.6%. Given German savings and trade surpluses, and given the problems of Greece, we expected that it would be the other way around. The same applies to Central and Eastern Europe. The least affected countries are getting a far bigger slice of the cake, while countries such as Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia and Romania get only tenths of a percent. I would like to know the basis on which loans are distributed between the individual countries.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, the European Investment Bank (EIB) can substantially influence the nature of planned investment activities through the political, technical and financial criteria it chooses to apply in the selection of financial assistance. The EIB’s criteria for providing financial assistance must therefore take into account certain visionary aspects of the changes expected in a civilised society.</p>
      <p sl="sk">Support for technologies which do not achieve better than average European environmental standards should therefore be very limited. In my opinion, the expert assessment of projects should, in the future, be based more on the input and participation of specialists assessing the environmental and innovative parameters of planned investments. This seems to me the only way that we can contribute, through EIB assistance, to enhanced innovation and more environmentally-friendly new investments, both in Europe and worldwide.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, let me deal with two issues which are of paramount importance for the work of the EIB and for our joint work to enhance sustainable growth and employment through investment. The first one relates to recent initiatives to bolster the EIB’s capital, a matter that was raised by many Members, and the second – a related issue in fact – is project bonds, which was also raised by several Members.</p>
      <p sl="en">You may recall that it was decided at the January European Council to strengthen EIB support for SMEs and infrastructure. The Council, the Commission and the EIB were invited to consider possible options to enhance EIB action to support growth and to make appropriate recommendations, including possibilities for the EU budget to leverage EIB group financing capacity, and to implement the relevant measures by June 2012.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission fully supports this objective and this work and we are currently exploring possibilities to do so. In this regard, Ms Gräßle raised the point that the Structural Funds are not an appropriate method for this. I would like to provide you with the Commission’s position on this, which has been, as always, collegially prepared.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Structural Funds are earmarked for individual Member States while the EIB’s Tier 1 capital must support the Bank’s entire operations. Hence, this Tier 1 capital cannot be allocated to specific Member States or sectors.</p>
      <p sl="en">Member States would thus have to agree unanimously to give up their national Structural Funds allocations for general use by the EIB. This is not feasible really, given the obstacles to using Structural Funds for these purposes to increase the EIB’s capital. The Commission is currently exploring alternative options. To achieve this objective, we are open to any convincing option which increases the EIB’s capital base with a significant and lasting leveraging effect and which has a solid financial prudential foundation.</p>
      <p sl="en">My second point: I informed you that the Council had reached an agreement yesterday on the Commission proposal for the project bonds’ pilot phase. This will support infrastructure projects by bringing new investors to the sector, which is a very important signal in the context of enhancing growth.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now, this agreement in the Council is the first major milestone towards adoption of the proposal, the other being, of course, the agreement of this Parliament. One of you said that the Commission has a duty to put forward a proposal on the pilot phase. I want to throw the ball back to Parliament. Parliament will, I trust, treat this file as a matter of the highest priority and we hope negotiations will start in April in time for its entry into force in June; we do not want to waste any more time but to get action moving in this very important field.</p>
      <p sl="en">I can tell you that, in the meantime, the Commission is preparing all the subsequent steps required for the implementation of project bonds so that this can take place immediately once the decision has been taken. At the same time, the EIB is intensifying its work on identifying suitable projects for this exercise.</p>
      <p sl="en">In other words, and in conclusion, all the stars are now aligned for a speedy implementation ensuring urgent support for Europe’s economy, its growth and job creation through investment in infrastructure.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, let me first of all thank you very much for this very warm welcome to the European Parliament for a long-time parliamentarian who, after 25 years, gave up his parliamentary seat just a couple of weeks ago. It is good to be back and to be in a debate. I welcome and thank you for so many interesting questions and suggestions in width and in depth. Unfortunately, I will not be able to cover all this in the remaining four minutes but let me assure you that I will be available to Parliament and its committees whenever you consider it useful.</p>
      <p sl="en">I believe there is a hidden treasure in Luxembourg. You here are all experts. You are all the European Investment Bank. If I go to the politicians on the budget committees or the economic committees of the parliaments of the Member States, I find limited knowledge about the EIB. Nobody knows what a valuable instrument this is for the European institutions. This is an institution which, by its lending volume, is far bigger than the World Bank. We must make this known among our citizens in the European Union because this is something we can bring into place when it goes in favour of job creation in Europe, change in the environmental situation in Europe, climate action, and when it comes to boosting innovation, growth and employment.</p>
      <p sl="en">We should develop this institution. Here, I consider this Parliament to be one of the best allies of the European Investment Bank and this is why I do not shy away from questions of transparency, compliance and auditing. I just went through my first experiences as President of the Bank in the field of auditing and compliance and I must say that I am proud of the procedures that have been adopted and improved over the last couple of years. There is always room for improvement. I am ready to talk about this with this Parliament. We have seen that the question of transparency plays such an important role for the European Parliament. I welcome this and this is a promise I can give you.</p>
      <p sl="en">What I would like to stress is the excellent cooperation we have with the Commission and I thank, in particular, Commissioner Rehn, but his colleagues as well, for this cooperation. I do not agree with the suggestion that might lie between the lines of what Ms Gräßle said. She said, do not draw funds from the European Commission, from the Union, over to the Bank. No, we have to do this together. We have to use the financing instruments of the Bank in order to reach the goals and the objectives of the Commission and the Union in general. This is the way we cooperate and this cooperation works very well.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, also in view of the new instruments we are developing, it is very important to bring in the expertise of the Bank at a very early stage. What impressed me the most when I arrived at the Bank was the fact that I found not only an incredible wealth of financial and banking expertise, I found also an incredible wealth of engineering capacities, of science and technology experts, and things like that. This is so important in coming to a really sound assessment of projects and proposals and we should, in the best sense of the word, bank on that. I think the Commission is doing that again and again, because our expertise is needed again and again.</p>
      <p sl="en">The activities of the bank have clearly been expanded from purely lending to also blending with the resources of the Commission and Parliament and the European institutions and advising, because the expertise that our bank incorporates can be made available to the Member States, to our partners in business. Business: this is the point. If I welcomed the pilot phase for the project bonds so warmly, which is obviously clear now, then this is also due to the fact that this is a very valuable instrument with which to get experience in raising private money. For the huge infrastructure challenges to be met over the next couple of years, we need to be able to attract more private money and this is how the European Investment Bank can make a contribution.</p>
      <p sl="en">A lot of things have been said about SMEs. If I look at the strengths of the economies of some of our Member States at least, or the European economy in general, one can say that here is the backbone of employment, of innovation in the European Union, so it is clear that we must strengthen them. We must also strengthen them where they are not so strong yet, but we have indeed been very active in the last couple of years. If I remember the figures correctly – we are talking about the 2010 annual report – more than EUR 11.5 billion was given out in cooperation with these small and medium-sized industries; overall, it is about 120 000.</p>
      <p sl="en">A last word, on innovation. In my view, this is the most important thing we need to think about in looking at our overall role. Our overall role is to contribute to the competitiveness of Europe in the globalised world. The share of innovation activities we all have there is not, in my view, sufficient. So, in addition, to what I have said about energy and energy efficiency, new energies in the fields of SMEs, innovation might be a very important additional pillar. Thank you very much and I am looking forward to very good cooperation with this Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, I wish to thank President Hoyer for his responsiveness and openness, and would also thank Commissioner Rehn and all my colleagues for this fruitful discussion. I also wish to thank everyone involved in the process of preparing this report, which I think is balanced and which acknowledges the EIB’s achievements in 2010 and highlights the red-flag points raised during our discussion.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me point briefly to some additional important elements in the report that have also been raised in our discussion today. Firstly, on financial instruments, I consider the cooperation between the EIB and the Commission in this field to be a good example of joint actions and I underline the positive outcome of existing instruments, such as the Risk Sharing Financing Facility. However, I believe it essential to develop a comprehensive global audit system which will contribute to ensuring the best control management of these instruments in view of their growing complexity.</p>
      <p sl="en">Secondly, on project bonds, I fully share Commissioner Rehn’s position and welcome and support the EU 2020 bonds initiative. I welcome the agreement on the pilot phase of the project, which I believe is crucial in order to assess the effectiveness of the new system and to remedy any problems which may occur, in advance and as soon as possible.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thirdly, on prudential regulatory supervision, I share the view that the EIB should be subject to the same prudential rules as other credit establishments in the Union. This will improve the prudential control on the quality of the Bank’s financial situation and will ensure that its results are accurately measured.</p>
      <p sl="en">Last but not least, the question of climate change was mentioned in the debate. I welcome the EIB’s action on climate change and call on it to refrain from funding certain types of projects which have devastating environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, I call for full alignment of the Bank’s operations with the EU objectives for a swift transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

      <p sl="en">I support Parliament’s resolution in response to the EIB’s 2010 annual report. The EIB is one of the most important EU institutions for supporting the real economy and it must play a leading role in getting the European economy growing and creating jobs again.</p>
      <p sl="en">In 2010, the EIB provided support to more than 100 000 SMEs across the EU. This is very welcome but we have to remember that there are 23 million SMEs in the EU, accounting for 98% of all enterprises and a huge number of jobs. I therefore very much welcome the resolution’s call for greater support to be provided for SMEs. I also look forward to the responses to the January European Council call for stronger EIB support for SMEs and infrastructure. In all of this, we have to ensure that EIB support for SMEs actually goes to the SMEs and does not remain with the banks.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also welcome the clear support in the resolution for the Europe 2020 project bond initiative to support major European infrastructure projects, as launched in a pilot phase by the Commission last October.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In order to ensure a comprehensive audit of the complex financial instruments that are continuously being developed by the EIB and its partners, it is essential to set up a comprehensive global control system. The fact that the report warns the bank to ensure increased transparency and better accountability in respect of its riskier programmes is welcome. Therefore, according to one of my motions for amendment, the EIB must be subjected in all cases to prudential regulatory supervision so as to ensure that it preserves its AAA rating and to enable the oversight of the quality of its financial situation, accurate measurement of its results and compliance with the professional rules of good conduct.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Furthermore, I fully support the EIB’s efforts to provide increased assistance to SMEs, which represent the driving force of the European economy. The report also highlights the leading role of the European Investment Fund (EIF) in supporting the EU economy and SMEs in particular. It underlines the weakness of the SME’s securitisation market and encourages the EIF to continue its efforts in supporting recovery. I definitely consider these remarks a significant step forward. I believe that in addition to the above, the EIB should continue to support the Europe 2020 strategy by leveraging Structural Funds and through further use of innovative financial instruments. It is therefore undeniable that this work has led to a balanced report. I congratulate the rapporteur and thank her for her exhaustive work.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Due to the current economic situation and the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Investment Bank is playing a special part in the EU’s life. Since the fundamental aim of the strategy is to achieve economic growth by means such as job creation, sustainable development, innovation and so on, projects financed by the EIB, in particular, those targeting small and medium-sized enterprises, the driving forces of the economy, constitute an important part of this.</p>
      <p sl="hu">However, in order for the EIB to be able to operate with appropriate effectiveness and efficiency and thereby contribute to the achievement of the EU’s strategic goals, due attention must be given to the measurement of its performance. This, in turn, requires, on the one hand, that both result and performance indicators as well as counterbalancing indicators be well-aligned to the strategy and cover the key strategic objectives. On the other hand, provision must be made for the measurement of quantifiable indicators so that they can be interpreted clearly by everyone.</p>
      <p sl="hu">An appropriate, well-functioning and clear performance evaluation system enhances transparency and accountability, which is of fundamental importance. What can the Commission do to ensure that the EIB applies the well-functioning performance measurement system of the European Court of Auditors? Is there any way for the Court to cooperate with the EIB to develop a new performance measurement system? What is the Commission’s position on the costs associated with performance indicators and the need to measure them?</p>

      <p sl="sk">The European Investment Bank (EIB) is one of the main instruments for implementing the EU’s strategic objectives and it plays a leading role in European economic recovery and in supporting growth.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The overall volume of loans provided, the project to get the European recovery back on track, and also the 30% growth in loans paid out for convergence objectives are key successes, not only for the bank itself, but particularly for economic recovery and revival in Europe. The bank’s chief activities are in support of the Europe 2020 strategy. We must encourage fully the EIB’s efforts to secure greater support for SMEs, which are the driving force of the European economy. The EIB’s activities are supported by funds obtained on the money markets. An AAA rating is therefore essential to the functioning of the bank. At the end of 2011, the ratings agencies gave the bank a negative outlook. It is therefore necessary to take measures to retain the excellent credit rating.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The EIB should continue to support the Europe 2020 strategy through the use of Structural Funds and through the application of other innovative financial instruments.</p>

      <p sl="pl">As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I am satisfied with the work of the European Investment Bank in 2010. I particularly approve of the bank’s work in relation to funding undertakings in the field of environment protection and, in particular, of the increase in the proportion of project experts whose work focuses primarily on energy efficiency/renewable energy projects from 40% in 2007 to 64% in 2011, and also of the inclusion of this matter in the bank’s priorities for 2011-2013. This is a positive step towards achieving the objectives of a low-carbon economy by 2050.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I think that in the next few years, the bank should give greater emphasis to projects which support the development of public transport and the management of water resources and which promote biodiversity. The European Investment Bank also supports small and medium-sized enterprises in the Central and Eastern European Member States. This support rose by 25%, or EUR 14 billion, in 2010. There was also a 30% increase in the disbursements in lending for convergence goals. This is an important trend, which contributes to the sustainable development of the Union and which should be maintained.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, the EIB wants to maintain its credibility, and so must strive for maximum transparency in its operations. To this end, greater use should be made of its website, and the language of its documents and its control and monitoring system should be simplified. It is also important to adopt criteria which allow real evaluation of effectiveness in the use of funds, instead of concentrating only on measuring results in terms of quantity.</p>

      <p sl="el">Firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report. The European Investment Bank is one of the means used to support the real economy. In the midst of the credit crisis, the Bank plays an important role in efforts to revive the European economy and support growth and create jobs. That is why I should like to highlight the achievements of the European Investment Bank in 2010, such as increased lending to back European measures to support the economy.</p>
      <p sl="el">I should also like to state that I endorse the position expressed in the report, that support for small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU should be one of the basic priorities of the European Investment Bank, given that small and medium-sized enterprises are the ‘engine’ that drives the European economy and creates jobs.</p>
      <p sl="el">Finally, I should like to highlight the need for appropriate measures to be taken to ensure that the Bank maintains its excellent AAA credit rating and is subject to the same preventive supervision rules as every other credit institution. That will safeguard the Bank’s financial standing and also ensure that results are measured accurately.</p>

    <intervention id="4-088-000" speaker_id="37324" name="Adina-Ioana VĂLEAN" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="rapporteur" nationality="Romania" p_group="Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)" m_state="RO">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, I would like to start by saluting the efforts of the European Commission to reinforce EU citizenship by giving real substance to citizens’ rights. This was done by introducing the report on citizenship in October 2010. This is indeed what we need in the EU: to take steps forward by engaging Member States, institutions and citizens to fully respect EU law and lift obstacles to the free movement of our citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">So far, the EU has been less successful and has not given enough priority to ensuring the legal framework is applied in practice. As a result, the free movement of persons has developed less than the other three freedoms. Over the last years, an increasing number of petitions have been registered with respect to problems encountered by EU citizens who exercise their right to free movement, accounting for approximately 25% of the total number of petitions received.</p>
      <p sl="en">Also, some progress has been achieved following the adoption of the Parliament report on application of the Free Movement Directive in 2008, of which I was the rapporteur, and also the publication of the Commission’s guidelines for implementation of the Free Movement Directive.</p>
      <p sl="en">Numerous petitions bear witness to the fact that there are still many problems related to the implementation of the directive: unjustified administrative burdens, particularly for third-country national family members, including entry requirements and lengthy procedural delays; a lack of recognition of free movement rights for certain registered partners, including those in a same-sex relationship; public policy exceptions to serve economic or security aims which have ignored the principle of proportionality, especially in abuses of expulsion orders; discrimination towards certain nationals and ethnic communities. These are just a few examples of such breaches of European citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a large gap between the expectation of citizens, who increasingly take free movement for granted and expect the spirit of the Treaty and the legislation to be respected, and the practice of national authorities who insist more on the conditions and exceptions.</p>
      <p sl="en">To achieve real free movement as well as EU citizenship, Member States need to be pushed to do it, to change their laws and administrative practices. The only institution that can do it is the one that is charged with the task of being the Guardian of the Treaties, the European Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">An important number of petitions highlighted the problems encountered by citizens on the mutual recognition and free circulation of civil status documents and their effects. Procedures for the recognition of documents can be extremely time consuming and involve many costs, especially with regard to translation and authentication. There are even Member States which refuse to issue certificates of civil status to persons who intend to engage in a partnership or marriage in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="en">Since free movement rights are guaranteed by a mix of European laws and national implementing measures, citizens often find themselves caught up in red tape, being asked to produce an excessive number of documents in original form or authenticated copies and translations. The problem with the recognition of professional qualifications brings delays in job applications that can take months, even years, preventing even the attempt to access the labour market. This hampers labour mobility, which has a positive impact on economic growth, so on and so forth. We have been discussing in the Committee on Petitions all these obstacles which citizens encounter in exercising their rights as European citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that this citizenship report is based on the petitions received from the citizens who address us with their concerns and worries, expecting the European Parliament to protect their rights guaranteed by the Treaty. The signal we are going to give today by voting on this report is an important one. The rights achieved by our citizens should be respected by all, no matter the political family we belong to or the country we come from.</p>

    <intervention id="4-089-000" speaker_id="photo_generic" name="Olli Rehn" is_mep="True" mode="spoken" role="Vice-President of the Commission">
      <p sl="en">Mr President, honourable Members, already 20 years ago, the Maastricht Treaty enshrined the concept of EU citizenship, and the Lisbon Treaty on European Union places citizens firmly at the heart of the European Union – as it should be. In practice, this means, and should mean, that people who travel outside their own country, whether for tourism, study, work, marriage or retirement, should be able to exercise their rights as European citizens as easily as in their own country, wherever they are in Europe.</p>
      <p sl="en">To this end, in October 2010, the Commission presented its first report on EU citizenship, which highlighted the obstacles which citizens may still encounter when travelling within the Union. The Commission proposed specific measures to remove these obstacles. I am glad to see today that our priority is also your priority, the priority of the European Parliament, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Vălean, for the excellent work she has done on the report.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome the fact that the report has been received with considerable interest by the various committees to which it has been submitted for an opinion. The Parliament has a key role to play in further developing EU citizenship. The Commission has taken firm action to ensure that all 27 Member States comply fully with EU citizens’ right to freedom of movement. Thanks to continued political pressure, we have achieved concrete results. Most, but not all, Member States have implemented the EU rules on free movement in full and, where Member States have failed to do so, the Commission has not hesitated to use its prerogatives and we have brought infringement proceedings against those Member States.</p>
      <p sl="en">Ms Vălean, in your report, you quite rightly emphasise the importance of non-discrimination. In April, the Commission will present its analyses of the Member States’ national strategies on the integration of the Roma people of Europe. You also stressed your concern that citizens should be informed of their rights; this is indeed an essential point and that is why we have set up the portal called Your Europe, in order to provide citizens in their own languages with detailed information on their rights. In addition to this portal, there are 500 Europe Direct centres in the Member States for the same purpose.</p>
      <p sl="en">Thus, to enable citizens to be better informed and involve them in a debate on the development of the European Union, we have proposed that the year 2013 should be the European Year of Citizens. You have now received this proposal, as has the Council, and we trust that an agreement can be reached swiftly.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission will present its second citizenship report in the course of this European Year of Citizens and it will report on the progress already made and propose new actions to make the EU into an area where justice and citizens’ rights are truly guaranteed. A public consultation for our citizens will be launched very soon, to involve citizens in this important initiative. Ms Vălean’s report already serves as a contribution for the European Parliament, and my colleague, Vice-President Viviane Reding, will continue to meet you in the coming weeks and months in order to receive your suggestions.</p>
      <p sl="en">In conclusion, if our joint efforts are to be successful, we must work in tandem and involve our citizens. The Commission is therefore anxious to conduct an open and constructive dialogue with all stakeholders in order to build a Europe that protects citizens’ rights: a Europe for citizens and a Europe at the service of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, for the past two years, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has been advocating the introduction and adoption by the Commission of a Citizens’ Rights Charter. This citizens’ charter would clearly outline citizens’ rights and obligations within the single market, especially for European citizens who want to move, sell, shop and work across borders.</p>
      <p sl="en">The urgent need for such an initiative was confirmed by the Commission’s study on citizens’ top 20 concerns, which was carried out in response to Parliament’s request, and which identified the significant informative, legislative and implementation gaps that frustrate the citizens in their everyday lives.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission must now address these concerns by presenting the top 20 solutions as soon as possible, to restore the crucial variable of credibility among citizens to the Market. These measures would correct consumers’ and SMEs’ negative perceptions of the single market, thereby boosting their participation in the market and reassuring the citizens that the EU works for them.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the Committee on Culture and Education warmly supports the conclusions of this report. Citizens’ rights are indeed important, not only as rights, but as a means to show citizens the value of the EU.</p>
      <p sl="en">For this reason, we need a common strategy on how to communicate with citizens. That is why the Culture Committee adopted an opinion stating that it wants ‘a comprehensive communication strategy’. That strategy is not in place and the Commission has done nothing to live up to Parliament’s demands. We have repeatedly asked for this strategy and have received nothing substantial.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, first of all, my congratulations to Ms Vălean on her excellent work. It is regrettable that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs found themselves split into two equal parts when voting on their opinion for the Committee on Petitions. I, as rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the advisers have worked a lot in order to propose a modern approach to the issue. Despite the failure of an opinion due to the final vote, I am satisfied that a number of important proposals were supported by the majority of the members of the Civil Liberties Committee and these are as follows.</p>
      <p sl="en">The right of Union citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States cannot be viewed in isolation from other rights and basic principles of the European Union, such as the freedom to provide services, respect for family life and social rights, as well as the mutual recognition of degrees and professional qualifications.</p>
      <p sl="en">We also urge the Commission to further its analysis of the situation of inter-EU migrants and to take appropriate action to ensure that they genuinely enjoy rights as Union citizens without discriminatory barriers. We call upon the Commission to urge the Member States to systematically bring about a just solution to the situation of stateless persons permanently residing in Member States.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, regrettably, many problems still persist as regards the implementation of European citizens’ rights, including the right to move and reside freely within the EU and electoral rights. One of the greatest obstacles to exercising active Union citizenship is the lack of awareness. We must intensify our efforts to provide useful and accessible information about EU citizenship rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">2013 will be devoted to citizenship and we should maximise our efforts politically and financially to make the best use of it. As you know, the set of rights attached to EU citizenship is now complemented by a new tool, the European Citizens’ Initiative, which comes into force on 1 April and is very important. In that regard, I would like to emphasise that the Vălean report is not the place to determine which committee should be responsible for the hearings after successful ECIs. This matter is being discussed at present in the committee concerned and will be submitted for discussion to Parliament in due course. This is not only disregarding the distribution of competences between committees, but is also a blatant attempt to bypass an open debate, which is not something this House should stand for.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I should like to thank the rapporteur and our assistants for their work.</p>
      <p sl="fr">This report now lives up to its name, as it addresses the issue of dismantling the obstacles to citizenship. Europe is a wonderful project, but all too often we find that it is not yet fully defined.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Take the economic crisis, for example. It highlighted our weaknesses and gave us the opportunity to create more sound regulatory institutions for the single market. The situation regarding European citizenship is similar. Every day, the Committee on Petitions, which is more like a complaints office, records citizens’ grievances. In three days’ time, the system will be completed with the European Citizens’ Initiative. In spite of all our policies calling for mobility, involvement, European values and exchange, there are still far too many obstacles to exercising citizenship. Citizens who do not see themselves as being European are citizens who will not turn out to vote and will not see the point of Europe in their everyday lives.</p>
      <p sl="fr">My colleagues and I from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) have made a huge number of proposals – the largest number in fact – and I should like to thank them for that. This report ought to bring about a feeling of belonging to Europe and a European sense of identity, which we must recreate and maintain through these measures. Our Europe must be a Europe that protects.</p>
      <p sl="fr">Commissioner Reding made 25 very concrete proposals to promote citizenship. They are vital if we are to restore trust between citizens and Europe. However, the proposals in this report reflect other expectations that our fellow citizens have: making purchases online, moving home, children’s rights, employment, citizen participation, health care abroad, twinning, rights of minority groups, etc. We are still finding it too difficult to take full advantage of the opportunities that Europe offers. Rights must be used; complaints must be heard and we in this House are the go-betweens.</p>
      <p sl="fr">The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must show citizens that freedom of movement also entails freedom to exercise their rights within Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, the report on dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights, which was published by the European Commission in October 2010, concentrates on 25 of the most important problems that citizens face in the exercise of their rights across borders, identified on the basis of an analysis of 300 petitions from the last three years.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Citizens most often face difficulties caused by complicated legislation, excessive bureaucracy, incorrect implementation of legislation and a plain lack of goodwill on the part of the authorities of particular Member States. In recent years, we have been seeing increasing numbers of problems related to the right to free movement – problems in this area account for as many as 25% of the petitions received. It is important that all EU citizens who are in another Member State should feel secure, know their rights and not encounter any form of discrimination on the grounds of race, nationality, religion or sexual orientation. I commend the rapporteur for drafting a good and useful report, which I hope will have a beneficial effect on the situation of the people who live in our shared European home.</p>

      <p sl="da">If we in the Committee on Petitions do indeed want to be the main committee involved in the Citizens’ Initiative, then it is for the sake of the citizens and in order to give citizens the opportunity to find out how to use the Citizens’ Initiative. It is all well and good to have such a nonsensical system that we believe we can find our way around ourselves, but the citizens are not able to do that. It is therefore a vital help to them that we have an all-round service-minded approach, and we therefore propose that the very committee in Parliament that is there for the citizens, in other words, the Committee on Petitions, should be the body that takes care of the uniform handling of the Citizens’ Initiative. In this way, we will know when the consultations can be held and we can ensure that the Commission and, of course, the relevant political committees are involved right from the start.</p>
      <p sl="da">The entire processing of the Citizens’ Initiative must obviously be done in a serious way and it must not be something that citizens will perceive as yet another way for us to deceive them in some way in order to make them believe that ours is a good system – but they are nevertheless unable to use it. I would therefore like to express my gratitude for the inclusion of this proposal. I hope that we will have Parliament’s support on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Mr President, Mr Rehn, there are many sensible things in this report. Besides, Ms Vălean has already spoken about them and, in fact, other speakers have also referred to a number of important things which it contains.</p>
      <p sl="pl">However, the report has, unfortunately, become a kind of wish list – probably as a result of the amendments which individual Members have tabled. It has become chaotic and now includes many details which should not have been added. In paragraph 10, we read that the report proposes harmonisation of national social security schemes and convergence of tax rules. What is the point of including this in a report of this kind and calling for the standardisation of tax and social security systems? This should be a matter for, and the responsibility of, the Member States. Decisions about what taxes are to be paid by Poles, Swedes and Germans should be made by the governments of Poland, Sweden and Germany and so on.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Also unacceptable is the part which calls on the Council to ensure that the Member States have sufficient budget funds to organise the European Year of Citizens. As you know, EUR 1 million has already been allocated from the budget of the Directorate-General for Communication to mark this year and celebrate it. There was no point in asking the Council to do this, and it should not be in the report. For this reason, my political group is going to vote against this report.</p>

      <p sl="el">Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Ms Vălean on her very good report. The report is based on the principle that everyone who is a citizen of a Member State of the European Union is also a European citizen. That is correct. Therefore, European Union citizenship supplements national citizenship without replacing it. That is why citizens’ rights are the main criterion in the report and the right to apply to the Ombudsman, the right to submit legislative proposals under a European Citizens’ Initiative, and the right to vote and to stand as candidates in local and European elections, are citizens’ inalienable rights.</p>
      <p sl="el">As a member of the Committee on Petitions, I can tell you that we receive a plethora of petitions from European citizens on the obstacles that they encounter in the exercise of their rights. It is therefore important for European citizens’ rights to be protected and to be described clearly in the Union’s legal provisions and to be applied, so that citizens can trust in the Union. The Committee on Petitions is trying to correct these problems by placing citizens at the centre of their activities. Man stands at the centre of the entire philosophy of the European Union: I trust that we shall manage to apply that principle.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, you will be aware that many in the UK object – object – to the imposed EU citizenship and do not want it. They love Europe but they hate the EU because it is dictatorial and undemocratic. The following letter from constituent Alan Sheath illustrates this point. ‘Dear Mr Nattrass, on 7 February 1992, Prime Minister John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty. Unbeknown to myself and the vast majority of British subjects, every person in the UK, including Her Majesty The Queen, became a European citizen by ratification. Neither I nor 60 million other British subjects were consulted or asked to vote. I do not want this citizenship, so please advise me what measures there are in place to renounce it. I remain content with my British birthright’.</p>
      <p sl="en">I see from the papers on this debate that the EU is now forcing the UK to wreck its social security systems by opening the floodgates to Europe and the UK is being forced to abide by the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union. We do not want foreign legal frameworks, so when can the British people have a democratic vote please?</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the entire committee, I would like to thank Ms Vălean for her excellent work, and it is undoubtedly also the case that, following this debate, it will be an important instrument for evaluating citizenship, as it provides the direct views of citizens themselves.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn because, by reminding us of the commitments Member States made in the Maastricht Treaty, he emphasised that any efforts towards a greater harmonisation of systems must be made according to the principle of subsidiarity. With this, I do not think I will be able to convince Mr Nattrass or Mr Migalski, but at least I will be able to give them some more points to consider.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to thank the committees that made a contribution to the important work of the committee that I chair, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which, with its proposal for a Citizens’ Rights Charter, has undoubtedly given a further boost to the European Commission project, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), which has focused on the subject of immigrants that often involves the Committee on Petitions, and also Ms Gurmai.</p>
      <p sl="it">I share the idea that this is not the place for defining the competence of the institutional committee that will deal with organising the popular initiative, but, at the same time, I believe that this is the right place for discussing better services for citizens. In the report, we point to the Committee on Petitions as being the best instrument for serving citizens’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="it">The report identifies 57 critical and positive points and, in my view, these do not cover all the complaints that citizens bring to our committee. However, these 57 points undoubtedly provide an important snapshot for the work that the European Commission will be carrying out in its promotion of European citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, it is fantastic to follow on from Ms Mazzoni. Ms Vălean, this is a brilliant report, in which you highlight exactly what the European Union is doing wrong – and what is that? It is failing to defend the fundamental rights of citizens.</p>
      <p sl="en">The Commission must enforce those fundamental rights, which are enshrined in the Treaty. If it does not, we will never be taken seriously within the global political domain, let alone within the legal domain. I welcome also the strong wording used in respect of protection of the Roma and other minorities and the tackling of all forms of discrimination, and also the focus placed on gender and disability.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to address the crucial issue of the fundamental freedom of movement for same-sex couples. There is no decent honourable reason to deny these people their freedom of movement and the right to be with their families. So I say this: if we do not defend the rights of others, how on earth can we expect our own rights to be defended? That is the basis upon which Europe was built.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Mr President, I agree with Mr Cashman. This report is excellent and it raises some very important issues for our citizens. It highlights issues that are regrettably rarely – never, in fact – included on the agendas of summit meetings and of Heads of State or Government.</p>
      <p sl="fi">I will mention two matters, the first of which is the rights of people with disabilities. We know that in Europe, there are 80 million people with disabilities that still face many obstacles to their mobility. A great many improvements need to be made for them, in order to ensure that the rights of citizens are implemented properly. The other important matter that should be raised here is the European Health Insurance Card. It entitles us citizens of the European Union to health care in emergencies in other countries, but I say – I venture to say – that many Finns, and many Europeans, are ignorant of this right. They do not know that the costs of the health care services that they can avail themselves of in an emergency in another EU country are repaid. The EU and its Member States should provide more information on this and act more effectively to remove the obstacles that people with disabilities face.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe sums up its policies towards citizens in the slogan ‘United in Diversity’. This is yet another ‘do-gooder’ paradox that is belied by the facts.</p>
      <p sl="it">When we have to force absurd directives and economic sacrifices on our citizens, the Treaties force Member States to be united. Yet where there is no legal obligation, events that require cooperation and solidarity show the true spirit of Europe, which is divided into twenty-seven countries focusing on protecting their own individuality.</p>
      <p sl="it">How can we forget Europe’s scandalous reaction to the events of the Arab Spring, when 50 000 refugees landed on the coasts of Italy and the northern Member States suspended the Schengen Agreement? And while, here in Parliament, we are asking for European citizenship to be invested with new meaning, eight Member States are applying to the Council for suspension of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the fund created to help our citizens, having themselves already benefited from it.</p>
      <p sl="it">Europe should stop using slogans and propaganda for concealing all its inconsistencies from the eyes of its citizens, who are the real financial backers of the European dream. Unless we are unanimous when it is a case of helping them, making 2013 the European Year of Citizens would only be yet more hypocrisy.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, we are told in this report that many people feel disenchanted with the EU project and it attributes this to citizens’ rights, particularly freedom of movement of people not being implemented. Well, people in my country, the United Kingdom, are certainly disenchanted with the EU, but it is because there is too much freedom of movement and not because there is too little.</p>
      <p sl="en">Large-scale migration from lower-wage countries in the East to higher-wage countries in the West has deprived the East of key workers and has deprived workers in the West of accommodation and employment. This has got nothing to do with freedoms enjoyed by individuals and everything to do with human beings being treated as though they were depersonalised facts of production that can be moved around to reduce wage rates to a common low level.</p>
      <p sl="en">There is a complaint that people are discriminated against on the ground of nationality. If only employers did employ their own nationals first – there would be less to be concerned about. Governments should ensure that their own people are put first in jobs and in housing. However, I am afraid employers often prefer to employ foreign workers because they are easier to exploit.</p>

      <p sl="mt">Mr President, much mention has been made of European citizenship as having been created through the Maastricht Treaty. One ought to remember that the Treaty also grants the right to petition, meaning the right of any citizen who feels that his or her rights have been breached to present a complaint, namely a petition. And the best way for one to exercise this right to petition is precisely through the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament, whose function it is to help remove any obstacles which might hinder citizens from exercising their rights. These obstacles are listed in this report. I have also followed this report in two other committees. In the Committee on Civil Liberties, we were unable to reach an agreement regarding an opinion for this report, due to the fact that – in my opinion – instead of focusing on existing rights and seeing how these are to be respected, we attempted to focus on other rights and issues which do not fall within the European Union’s area of competence. This led to our being unable to reach an agreement regarding the aforementioned opinion. As already mentioned by Mr Grech, there also was an opinion in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. What I found most interesting in this opinion was the concept of a ‘one-stop shop’ for citizens, which makes it possible for citizens to present their complaints to one single place instead of having to refer to several different places to present the same complaint. At the end of the day, if we really want to be close to the citizens, the first thing we have to do is ensure that their rights as European citizens are respected.</p>

It is the large disparity between the contents of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and what actually goes on day to day, which is a potent rise in national egoism and a disgraceful reduction in freedom of movement.

      <p sl="nl">Mr President, in theory, all that sounds very nice, of course: European citizenship and the right of European citizens to move freely from one Member State to another, for work in particular. Who could be against that? However, reality, ladies and gentlemen, provides a very different picture, a picture which, strangely enough, is not reflected in the report before us.</p>
      <p sl="nl">In my own country, for example, there are major problems in all regional capitals without exception, in particular, with Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants, especially with the Roma amongst them. Even the very socialist mayor of the regional capital of Ghent said these words, and I quote: ‘Even if we want to be a welcoming and inclusive city, when it comes to the reception of Eastern Europeans, we have now had enough’.</p>
      <p sl="nl">I think it is unacceptable that these very real issues are being swept under the carpet in this report because of a kind of blind European idealism, by none other than a parliamentary committee which, ideally, should be paying attention to the real problems of all citizens, not just one category of citizens.</p>

      <p sl="de">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a committed citizen of the Republic of Austria. I am also a committed citizen of the European Union. For this reason, I expressly welcome the Commission’s 2010 report on European citizenship and the report of the Committee on Petitions based thereon because the good news is that this project has not failed, but rather we have realised what it is that needs to be improved. This realisation is worthy of particular praise. It has been recognised that it is not enough to record citizens’ rights on a piece of paper, but that it is also necessary to ensure that these rights are cast in appropriate legislation and then implemented as directly as possible with the minimum of red tape.</p>
      <p sl="de">Here are three examples. How can citizens fully exercise their right to freedom of movement within the Union when uncertainties still exist in relation to the provision of, and access to, social security entitlements? How is the European Higher Education Area to be implemented, involving the right to free access to education, if students still encounter problems with the accreditation of university qualifications and courses? How can citizens be convinced of their rights in relation to cross-border health care if the reimbursement of costs is often excessively delayed, in many cases incomplete, and frequently involves too much bureaucracy?</p>
      <p sl="de">I therefore call on the Commission to transform these insights into concrete actions. Only then will the European Year of Citizens 2013 bring tangible and concrete benefits to our citizens.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Mr President, the report reveals that while the right to free movement and residence is the most widely known right among citizens, the petitions submitted indicate that this right is the subject of the majority of the complaints received. This means that it is the right to free movement with which EU citizens associate the EU the most, so we could also say that the dismantling of physical and virtual borders between Member States is the most popular achievement of integration. At the same time, citizens are the most sensitive to infringements of this very right. Indeed, the petitions received bring to our attention a high number of irregularities, but let us not forget that to this day, the citizens of two Member States cannot feel equal with the rest of the EU’s citizens. Moreover, they are not given a justified answer when they ask why this is so. The inexplicable delay in the Schengen accession of Bulgaria and Romania is a violation of the EU citizenship-related rights of the citizens of these two Member States. Would it really take 27 million petitions for this to change?</p>

      <p sl="sk">Mr President, due to the lack of time, I will talk about two shortcomings for which I criticise the report. On the one hand, the report neither mentions nor addresses the issue of racism, despite the comments of NGOs. In my opinion, this is a very basic error, as racist behaviour is a serious obstacle to the fulfilment of citizenship and civil rights in the EU, and there has been a dramatic increase in right-wing extremism in the EU.</p>
      <p sl="sk">The other problem area is denial of the right of free movement of persons in the case of ethnic minorities, and this is mainly due to the existence of various barriers. There can be no doubting that the free movement of ethnic and religious minorities is frustrated on a daily basis. This applies particularly to the Roma. Enforcement of the legal right to free movement must also include the right not to be discriminated against, and it must be applied in this sense, for example, in the case of illegal deportations or other violations of this right. I firmly believe that anti-discrimination must be a central feature of EU citizenship, and we must ensure that it is adequately transposed into existing legislation.</p>

As an example, I would like to mention the petition of the Polish organisation Campaign Against Homophobia. In this case, however, the Commission’s response was very precise.

      <p sl="it">As Vice-President Rehn reminded us, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in strengthening citizenship policy. The committee’s report identifies hurdles that citizens still have to overcome when exercising their rights, especially in a cross-border context, and lists twenty-five actions for overcoming them.</p>
      <p sl="it">I am happy to announce that next week, in my capacity as the commissioner responsible for industry and the internal market for goods, I will propose that the College of Commissioners adopt one of these actions, a legislative proposal that will enable us to simplify the formalities and procedures involved in registering cars that have previously been registered in another Member State.</p>
      <p sl="it">I would also like to respond to some of the comments that have been made during the debate regarding your concerns about citizens being informed about their rights. This is essential, and is the reason why we created the ‘Your Europe’ portal, which provides citizens with detailed information about their rights in their own language.</p>
      <p sl="it">As far as the integration of Roma is concerned, last year, a European framework law was adopted according to which Member States are obliged to set up national strategies for integrating the Roma. I am also thinking about the delicate problem of schooling for Roma children and their exploitation. The Commission has received these strategies and will be presenting a report in April.</p>
      <p sl="it">During the European Year of Citizens, the Commission will also be presenting its second citizenship report, which will sum up the progress made so far and propose new actions to make our Union a place where citizens have rights and receive justice. A public consultation for involving citizens in this activity will be launched on Europe Day on 9 May this year.</p>
      <p sl="it">In order also to allow citizens to be better informed and to be involved in a debate on the development of the Union, we proposed that 2013 should be the European Year of Citizens. Honourable Members, this proposal is now in your hands and in the hands of the Council, and we hope that it will be possible to reach an agreement quickly.</p>
      <p sl="it">In conclusion, on 1 April, the European Citizens’ Initiative will be launched on the Commission’s website. This will also be a means for reinforcing the relationship between citizens and the European Commission, and therefore of strengthening the link between Europeans and the EU institutions. I think it is another strong signal that the institution that I represent wants to send out to half a billion Europeans.</p>

      <p sl="en">Mr President, the 2010 Eurobarometer survey shows that only 42% of Europeans know their rights, while the special Eurobarometer from 2011 reveals that 85% of Europeans lack sufficient information about the Charter of Fundamental Rights. A citizens’ Europe for and by the people will only be successful when we ensure that people can exercise their rights in full knowledge of what those rights are and how to benefit from them.</p>
      <p sl="en">In this context, I welcome the Commission’s proposal to declare 2013 as the European Year of Citizens, aiming to enhance awareness of their rights and the advantages attached to European citizenship. However, looking at the budget allocated for the preparation and implementation of this European Year – EUR 1 million, the smallest ever budget envisaged for such a year – I can only imagine that it will allow for top-down communication measures and not for the tangible actions boosted so often by the Commission.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also want to draw attention once again to the request made by the Committee on Culture and Education for a comprehensive communication policy on citizens’ rights.</p>
      <p sl="en">Let me conclude by saying that, for this report today, I have tabled, thanks to the support of 120 colleagues from different political families, an amendment with a paragraph which was, unfortunately, voted down in the Committee on Petitions. The paragraph called on the Member States to ensure freedom of movement for all EU citizens and their families without discrimination on grounds of their sexual orientation or nationality. I expect all the democratic and pro-European groups in this House to support the report in the vote today in plenary and not act as if on a battlefield, as they normally do in the Petitions Committee, because the report is based on what citizens are requesting and their problems; it is based on petitions and not on wishful thinking, and it should be voted for, no matter what political orientation or country we come from.</p>

      <p sl="lt">People in the European Union still face obstacles in actively exercising their rights as EU citizens. For example, current events regarding the creation of websites discriminating against Central and Eastern European workers show that the rights of European Union citizens are still under threat. We must therefore defend the right of citizens to move and work freely, because the free movement of workers is one of the most important European Union values and all workers must have the same rights and be respected in all EU Member States. Secondly, every day, people with disabilities in the European Union encounter many physical and social barriers preventing them from enjoying their rights, such as normal use of public buildings, public services, free movement and use of public transport, infrastructure, information technology and other measures and services. Unfortunately, the high level of unemployment is the greatest obstacle to the inclusion of disabled people in society, and unemployment among disabled people arises because of insufficient preparation for the labour market. In accordance with the European Disability strategy (2010-2020), the Member States and the Commission must therefore take active steps to overcome barriers to movement and accessibility for people with disabilities because that would solve many other problems, such as social isolation, discrimination, unemployment, etc. I also call on the Member States to actively make the most of the European Year of Citizens 2013 and raise people’s awareness of the rights attached to Union citizenship.</p>

      <p sl="ro">To ensure that EU citizenship does not remain a mere concept and provides citizens with practical opportunities, I believe that there are some legislative, implementation-related and information gaps that need to be eliminated. EU citizenship will operate properly when the procedure for settling in another Member State does not entail additional problems compared with the situation in the Member State of origin. From a legislative perspective, improving the system for recognising professional qualifications, facilitating the portability of pensions and other social rights, providing broader access to banking services or facilitating the re-registration process for vehicles when they are moved from one state to another are just some examples of the reforms required. European citizens are more than just consumers. They are people who get married, divorced, gain inheritances and the like. When partners are of different nationalities or have lived in several Member States, these circumstances must not complicate matters. We recently adopted the regulation on succession. We greatly need such initiatives which set out clear rules and make people’s lives simpler in cross-border situations. Last but not least, providing information plays a vital role. The ‘Your Europe’ portal has been revamped and provides extensive information about various initiatives. I believe that this must continue to be promoted and developed.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Through the work of the Committee on Petitions, the European Parliament is in direct contact with those EU citizens who appeal to the legislative body in connection with the restriction of their rights within the EU. The latest EU citizenship report is important to legislative planning, as it illustrates through concrete examples what difficulties EU citizens still have to face, and in which areas, when intending to exercise their rights guaranteed by the Treaties. During my meetings with citizens I, too, often see that while a great many economic, cultural and other opportunities have already opened up within the borders of the internal market, there are still some barriers and unpleasant experiences that can prevent Member State citizens from freely exercising their rights. The petitions received essentially hold up a mirror to the institutions, and contain accurate data that helps us take the next step in resolving these problems. It comes as no surprise to read that there are still Member States that raise barriers to the exercising of social rights and the rights of participants in higher education or members of the liberal professions. Citizens of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and thereafter still have to face greater difficulties when seeking to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Treaties as full EU citizens. It is the duty of the institutions to facilitate the appropriate transposition of EU laws by the Member States and to accelerate the remedying of the recently revealed electoral, social, administrative, educational and other discriminative measures.</p>

      <p sl="en">I fully endorse Ms Vălean’s report, which, in a practical way, addresses the often glaring gaps between what EU citizenship delivers on paper and what citizens encounter in reality. The main problem, of course, is that EU citizens are unaware of their rights and are therefore not in a position to object when these are denied to them. The ‘Your Europe’ website, mentioned several times in the report, is an excellent one-stop shop to find out about Europeans’ rights as citizens and business people in a variety of situations and every effort must be made to promote it. Well-informed citizens are an essential ingredient in a fully-functional single market. We MEPs play an important part in conveying this information to our constituents. In this report, we also call for public consultations to be made available in all official EU languages, as we did in the Kraków Declaration following the Single Market Forum 2011. An accessible and pro-active consultation policy is a must for meaningful engagement with citizens. We must not rest on our laurels but get to work to lift the barriers identified here which are preventing Europeans from enjoying their rights as EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="lt">The rights of European Union citizens comply with the highest standards in terms of protecting people from abuses of power. There is great emphasis on the principle of justice as the foundation of communication between the state and citizens. There are still European Union Member States that do not respect this principle and justice has nothing to do with equality of all before the law. This includes disregard for property rights, particularly property rights to plots of land in Lithuania, where land that was seized in the Soviet period is in the process of being re-privatised. Very often, land is not returned to its rightful owners despite documents confirming their right to the property. Plots of land are going to people who, until now, had never owned them. This leads to misuse of finances and corruption and, most importantly, violates the sacrosanct right to property. The state is thus applying laws to citizens inconsistently and is selectively violating human rights. Another example concerns the infamous paedophile scandal in Lithuania, involving high-ranking justice officials, including judges. The court, the police and bailiffs are doing everything they can to remove a child, who is also the victim and principal witness of this event, from her custodian. Everything is happening in an atmosphere of fear with the public authorities making a show of force. It seems that the aim of all of this is to intimidate witnesses rather than dismantle an organised paedophile ring. This is an example of a violation of citizens’ rights showing that in such situations, some are more equal than others. Citizens’ rights must be equal for all, regardless of a person’s place of residence or social status.</p>

      <p sl="pl">It is very important that the European Parliament, the institution which is, in fact, closest to the citizen, should speak on the subject of dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights. This is everyday fare for us in the Committee on Petitions. The citizens regularly ask for our help, and complain about numerous barriers which prevent them from enjoying their rights as citizens. People with disabilities are in the worst situation, one in which they encounter many obstacles on a daily basis. It is difficult for them to be able to make normal use of the education system or to have access to insurance or to public transport facilities. There is a need for a coherent EU system for determining the degree of disability because the lack of such a system often leads to social exclusion. Public authorities have an obligation to identify and eliminate obstacles and barriers which prevent people with disabilities from exercising their rights as citizens. Access to buildings and services available to the general public, including transport, public institutions and places of public education and information, is not a privilege – it is the right of every citizen. We must not forget this; indeed, it is our duty to make sure that such situations do not occur.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report seeks to define and apply what is termed ‘European citizenship’, as if it made sense to regard the nationals of individual countries first and foremost as members of a ‘European nation’. It also proposes a number of harmonisation measures, particularly in taxation and social security, and promotion of the digital single market, which confirms the report’s entire federalist outlook. Moreover, it advocates unacceptable interference in the internal workings of political parties by proposing that ‘membership of a European political party could be suggested more often when someone joins a national party’ and that ‘more direct participation by citizens through European political parties’ should be encouraged, based on the idea that all parties are like-minded and operate in the same way. It thus seeks to impose a single political and ideological way of thinking. Some people, however, are deeply opposed to this path, even though the majority in Parliament try to ignore this fact.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Madam President, the Commission welcomes the political agreement reached on the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), but hopes that the minutes mention its legal objections concerning one of the provisions of the text. The Commission considers that Article 67(3) should be deleted. According to the Commission, Article 290 should be interpreted as meaning that it is independent in the preparation and adoption of delegated acts. The standard recitals on experts’ opinions in the memoranda of understanding agreed between the three institutions reflect this interpretation. It is therefore unacceptable, and contrary to Article 290, to go beyond the recital provided for by the memorandum of understanding and to introduce an obligation to consult experts on a material provision.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, the committee chair will make a statement on this legal question in a few minutes. The Council and Parliament have rejected the Commission’s motion. Thus, there is agreement between both legislative institutions that the motion is not justified.</p>
      <p sl="de">However, allow me to make a few comments on the project. This regulation on derivatives is one of the centrepieces of financial market control. Three-and-a-half years after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, we are now making sure that future over-the-counter derivatives agreements are managed centrally, also requiring that they should be backed with equity capital and reported to the relevant authorities. The volume in 2011 was USD 708 billion, 12 times the gross world product of the entire world population of 7 billion people. The new regulations finally give supervisory authorities an insight into this huge, confusing market. The risk to financial instruments is reduced. By deploying central counterparties, who must be consulted on every transaction in the future, we have established stringent requirements, including regulations for institutions in third countries.</p>
      <p sl="de">At this point, I would like to thank all my colleagues, as well as the Commission, and Commissioner Barnier. I find it regrettable that the Rules of Procedure do not allow a thorough debate for such an important vote. In view of the fact that the number of informal trialogues is mounting, I would call for a swift change to these provisions. After all, the result of the debate held here in Parliament in July 2011 has been the subject of trialogue negotiations ever since and we have not had an opportunity to discuss it. The Rules of Procedure need to be changed in this regard.</p>

ESMA is not made up of Member State experts; it is an independent regulatory authority and this House forcefully upholds the independence of that body. They are not Member State experts, and the article does not impose an obligation. Therefore, for this and other reasons, we do not share the opinion of the Commission that it infringes Article 290 TFEU, nor indeed the interinstitutional agreement to which the Commission has also referred.

The executions were, in all likelihood, carried out before our decision, at the beginning of the Strasbourg week. Executions in Belarus are carried out in secret. We do not know exactly when they took place. It is therefore not a fair insinuation to suggest that our decision two weeks ago caused the situation to deteriorate.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, it has come to my knowledge that Serbia has not yet sent the signed agreement on integral border management (IBM) to the EU facilitator of the Belgrade/Priština dialogue, Mr Robert Cooper. This agreement was reached on 24 February in the dialogue with Priština and was one of the key reasons Serbia was granted candidate status on 1 March. Priština sent the official and signed copy of the agreement to Mr Cooper, while Belgrade has not yet done so. Implementation of the IBM is of utmost importance; Belgrade needs to act.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call on the Serbian Government to hand in these documents and thereby keep its credibility and demonstrate its commitment to implementation of the agreement. I speak on behalf of all the shadow rapporteurs, whom I thank for their constructive work on the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, first, I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for the very good and constructive cooperation on a report that strongly supports the European perspective for Kosovo. I should like to make one remark and one request.</p>
      <p sl="en">The remark is that two months have passed since the report was voted on in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in January and many things have happened in and around Kosovo, for example, the positive outcome of the dialogue between Priština and Belgrade, and the Council conclusions which paved the way for a further European perspective and integration for Kosovo. That is why I tabled about 11 amendments which refer to these events and I would like to ask you to support them.</p>
      <p sl="en">I have one request for the S&amp;D Group, which refers to the first amendment that we are going to vote on now – Amendment 13 – which also refers to the outcome of the dialogue. I believe that placing this amendment right at the beginning is not right. I think it should go under paragraph 2, which refers to the dialogue, and I would like to ask the S&amp;D Group rapporteur to accept this repositioning to a different place. If the S&amp;D Group does not accept that, I would ask Members to vote against it because the issues are covered in paragraph 2.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, an obvious point about immigration is that people do not lightly uproot themselves and cross the world in order to settle in another country without having chosen that country with some care. The experience of countries which have run proper immigration policies is that new settlers are grateful and patriotic and happy to be there, which is why they came in the first place. The difficulty of a system which forces economic migrants into the category of claiming refugee status bogusly is that they begin the relationship with a new state on the basis of a lie. The experience of getting in under false pretences is bound to teach them to despise the authorities of the country in which they have arrived.</p>
      <p sl="en">It seems to me crazy at a time when we are admitting a certain amount of labour that we are doing so through a route which is based on falsehood on both sides, rather than having, as Canada, Australia, and a number of other countries do, a points-based system where people are chosen on the basis of their skills.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, when we talk about refugees, I have the impression that too often we go to extremes on both sides of the argument. I say this because all those who say that very often, the right to political asylum is abused by people who are actually migrating for economic reasons are, of course, correct. On the other hand, however, it should be remembered that we must not – as we sometimes say – throw the baby out with the bathwater. For example, I come from a country from which, over the centuries, very many people had to flee for political reasons, and they found a welcome in other countries. Europe is attractive because it is a place of freedom, and it should welcome all those who have defended freedom in their own countries but cannot live there.</p>

On top of this, in many Member States, including my own, the United Kingdom, which has already taken a disproportionate number of refugees in recent decades, this would not work. The UK has actually done much to help asylum seekers and refugees who already find themselves within its borders.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of establishing the European Refugee Fund, even though each Member State is individually responsible for its own refugee policy. Furthermore, Member States should continue to be responsible in this way, but we also need European-wide coordination, as, in many respects, the influx of refugees has been uncontrolled. We need the system of resettlement that is mentioned in this proposal. Above all, however, the basis of our actions must be that we, as Europeans, support countries from which those people are arriving, in their efforts to establish democracy, because it is not good for anyone to have to leave their homeland and their roots. The basic approach should be that we work towards the resettlement in their home districts of people arriving from these countries under threat, building democracy there, and exporting European values there. As I said, however, in this situation, in which we have an uncontrolled immigration policy at European Union level, we need coordination. Nevertheless, Member States must retain their own decision-making powers regarding the number of immigrants each country admits.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, at a time of economic difficulty across the world, and particularly in the eurozone, and with the EU budget itself under enormous pressure, I cannot see the justification for shelling out huge amounts of cash this way.

Britain has a noble history of providing shelter to genuine asylum seekers and takes more than its fair share of the load, but these common EU priorities of ‘resettlement’ are unwelcome, unhelpful and unaffordable.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, there are a number of lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis. One of the lessons is that governments should stop spending more money than they actually collect in taxes, and be more responsible. That is one of the reasons we find the levels of debt we do right across the EU. Actually, one of the problems with the whole eurozone crisis at the moment is that governments are simply spending more money than they have.</p>
      <p sl="en">The other issue we should tackle is the balance sheets of banks. For far too long, these derivatives have sat on banks’ balance sheets and have not been properly accounted for. The directors of those banks often do not know what is on the balance sheets, and one of the problems is that the IFRS standards, which the Commission has been so keen to promote, actually give an inaccurate picture.</p>
      <p sl="en">Another problem is that when one of these contracts blows up, the counterparties should have enough capital to make sure that they can pay out. Those are issues which we saw during the crisis when CDOs and CDSs blew up and not enough provision had been made. We need more transparency in banking and more transparency on the balance sheet, to make sure we learn the lessons of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="it">These statements are, at the very least, worrying. Does the European Union intend to find out whether these significant and weighty statements are true? Because of all the things we find out about derivatives, one thing is certain, and that is that there is an organisation and a mysterious trafficking that allows the system of major international speculation to decide on the policies which then affect actual people, working men and women who are responsible for producing in Member States, and this does not correspond to our vision of a Europe which needs to be a Europe of people and regions, not of bankers.</p>

      <p sl="en">Within the report there are, however, many positive examples of how Parliament can reduce its expenditure for next year. In particular, I supported the proposal that the European Parliament should have a single seat. This would make substantial savings, as illustrated in a number of publicly available reports, and would further help to avoid the wasteful duplication of office space and the unnecessary journey to Strasbourg every month.

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, the estimates for the 2013 budget show no evidence of any substantial savings. Even just the insistence that Parliament be given a single seat would be a step in the right direction to slim down this costly project. I will, therefore, vote against this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, in 2012, the UK contribution to the EU budget will be just over EUR 19 billion according to the Treasury’s Pink Book. To put that figure in context, all of the savings that we have made in our domestic spending – changes in child benefit, changes in housing benefit, the cut in local government grants – all of those things put together come to 8.6 billion. In other words, all of our austerity measures have saved only a third of our contributions to the EU budget. And where is that money going? If anyone is watching me on EuroparlTV at the moment, they may be the single most subsidised square yard in discovered space. EuroparlTV costs EUR 67 000 per hour of emission and attracts at peak 900 viewers. Or maybe some of the money is going to the House of European History at the cost of GBP 131 million.

      <p sl="en">It cannot be morally right, and it is surely economically indefensible at a time when all 27 Member States are struggling to make administrative savings, that every euro they spend is sent here to be squandered by the Brussels authorities.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, the report on estimates of revenue and expenditure for 2013 contains a number of cost-saving measures which I am happy to support in order to reflect the struggle of our own Member States, which they continue to face and have done on a year-to-year basis in their own budgets since the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
      <p sl="en">I welcome efforts to change working methods in Parliament, which I feel can be done in very many ways. Perhaps the most important measure, however, is that a single seat for the European Parliament could lead to very substantial savings. The general public are rightly outraged at the staggering figure of over EUR 450 million per year it takes to maintain the Strasbourg seat. It is unacceptable and must be stopped, and I urge colleagues from all Member States to support this cause.</p>
      <p sl="en">I look forward to upcoming reports detailing avenues for savings in Parliament’s budget for 2013 and I hope that they will find further possibilities for efficiency. In recognising the calls for savings and the importance of the paragraph on the Strasbourg seat, I have decided to vote in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, nothing the European Parliament can say, no call we make for savings, no amount of tilting at windmills – nothing we might do to persuade the citizens to have greater faith in the European institutions – will be sincere or effective if we do not, once and for all, carry out effective reforms which result in a single seat for the European Parliament. I would not like to say which seat – Brussels or Strasbourg – should be chosen, but the European Parliament should have a single seat. I do think, however, that all the arguments which were originally used, which were used in the early days of our Union to justify having two seats, are no longer valid today. Today, the great objective of achieving reconciliation between Germany and France – a very important objective – has now been accomplished, but today the European Parliament’s two seats very clearly symbolise the way in which our institutions have become distanced from the aspirations of the European Union’s ordinary citizens.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Madam President, I was unable to support the submitted report as it contains misleading information on Parliament’s one seat. The European Parliament has had one seat since it was founded, and that is Strasbourg. I fully support cutting costs in a time of belt-tightening. Let us get rid of the expensive buildings in Brussels and cancel the unnecessary mini plenaries. We should also discuss whether the idea of one seat is compatible with construction of the Konrad Adenauer complex in Luxembourg. None of the supporters of the single seat have yet questioned this. Parliament’s budget for next year also includes funding for the House of European History. If we do not want this history to be trampled on and robbed of its meaning, we must stop questioning Strasbourg’s place as the seat of the European Parliament.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, this report on the budget by Derek Vaughan is certainly a step in the right direction. I was very pleased to see such a large majority in this House vote in favour of one seat, but we in Parliament have already taken some concrete steps in that direction by combining the August and September plenary sittings in Strasbourg into one instead of two trips in September. Next year, we could look at doing the same thing for a number of other months, so that we end up with bi-monthly visits rather than two per month, which would have the effect of cutting the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">I also voted for the procedure to verify all expenditure from the general expenditure allowance. I do not actually think that would save a great deal of money because we would probably need to employ a lot of staff to verify what was happening, but it would contribute significantly to accountability and greater transparency.</p>
      <p sl="en">Finally, I believe that the establishing of a working group to take a full look at Parliament’s budget and to look into travel and other costs is a positive recommendation. We must then, of course, act on the recommendations that it makes.</p>

      <p sl="de">Madam President, like Ms Záborská, I fail to understand why the Brussels supporters are so pleased about Article 2, because we have had one seat for a long time now. The Treaty states: the seat of the European Parliament is in Strasbourg. We simply need to implement this appropriately, as President Schulz has stated in his most welcome initiative, which we should support. I want to make one thing very plain: if we had dispensed with today’s nonsensical mini plenary sitting – as we could have done without any change to the Treaty – and if we had voted on all this business in the normal plenary in Strasbourg, then we would have taken a first step to save money. However, this was prevented by the same people who tell us that we need to save money. This is therefore nothing more than hypocrisy and propaganda.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, at a time when governments not just across the EU, but, in fact, across the world, are having to tighten their belts and look at every penny spent, it is shocking that here in the EU, we have actually increased the budget.</p>
      <p sl="en">The budget should not even have been frozen – it should simply have been cut to reflect what national governments are having to do, which is to tighten their belts and act more responsibly. When you look at government expenditure, it is about time we had more transparency in all government expenditure, be it at EU level, national level, or across the world. It is time more governments published not only what they take in, but also what they pay out, so that citizens in the respective countries can hold those governments and politicians to account.</p>
      <p sl="en">Therefore, I would welcome, as many people would, more transparency concerning revenue and expenditure under the EU budget, particularly with reference to Parliament.

      <p sl="ga">Firstly, in a time of economic crisis all over Europe, we cannot spend EUR 880 million per year travelling to Strasbourg.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Secondly, it is becoming more difficult to travel to Strasbourg every month. It takes me, for example, 13 hours to travel there.</p>
      <p sl="ga">Thirdly, prices are increased when the MEPs travel to Strasbourg; the cost of accommodation and even the prices in Parliament. For example, it costs EUR 1.60 to buy a glass of orange juice here. In Parliament in Strasbourg, it costs – as far as I can remember – EUR 3.20. This makes no sense.

      <p sl="en">Madam President, we often use excessive superlatives when talking about dictatorial regimes, but it is difficult to do so in the case of Belarus. Here is a Caligulan tyranny in the heart of Europe and on the borders of the European Union. A lot of this report today focused on the application of the death penalty. I am more concerned by the naked autocracy of a system where, to give one example, at the last presidential election, there were nine candidates, one of whom was elected, one of whom was left alone and the other seven of whom were imprisoned. It is extraordinary that we have a situation where people are habitually incarcerated for saying inconvenient things.</p>
      <p sl="en">I am a souverainiste , I believe in the national independence of countries, but we also are sovereign countries and we have our own right to take a position on the democratisation of neighbouring countries. Belarus is also in our ‘near-abroad’. I think we should be proud of the fact that in this Parliament, and particularly in our group, colleagues from the PIS in Poland, colleagues like Mr Migalski, and British Conservatives have been in the front line pushing for the democratisation and freedom of that country. Those who believe in a pluralist multi-party system there should know that they have friends.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, the two highly dubious executions carried out recently in Belarus are yet another example of how much the Belarusian nation is suffering today under the yoke of the cruel dictator, Aleksandr Lukashenko. It has to be said today that the trial of the alleged perpetrators of the terrorist attack on the Minsk metro was a show trial and, unfortunately, what happened at the trial does not engender confidence in the justice system in Belarus. However, in the light of what has happened following these terrible executions, and the complaint made by the mother of one of the men who were executed that she and her family have not been allowed to bury her son, it also has to be said that in our civilisation, this is something which has been respected even by the worst of dictators. Today, Lukashenko does not even care about the pain of a mother who has lost her son. Finally, I would like to say that unfortunately, this arrogance demonstrated by Lukashenko would not be possible if it were not for the help this dictator is continually being given by the Kremlin.</p>

However, we must not close our eyes to the fact that the situation there, instead of getting better, is getting worse. Worst of all, many opposition political activists have been cut off from contact with Europe and the world. They have been told they cannot leave the country, and many of those who would like to modernise and change the country have been put in prison. On the other hand, the recent executions already referred to by Mr Kamiński arouse our worst fears as to the direction in which Belarus is moving, for while it is difficult to accept executions, it is much more difficult to accept a lack of respect for the minimum standard of decency and the right of the family to bury the body of a loved one, even if it was someone who had been sentenced to death. It is the duty of the European Parliament to call for the release of all political prisoners and for greater democracy, even if we are sometimes in doubt as to whether the calls we make are effective.</p>

The increasingly repressive regime, which is basically a dictatorship, is really a deplorable one, so I welcome the extension of the EU targeted travel sanctions against representatives of the regime who are responsible for the violent repression of its citizens. Repression has also been intensified recently against civil society activists, democratic opposition and the freedom of the media.</p>

Exactly the opposite was true. The regime used the Games to enhance its profile. That was a case of bad gesture politics.

But, of course, what we are doing is stepping in and saying, ‘we do not allow you even your internal domestic legal system’, something that has not happened in Serbia since the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum of 1914. That, of course, was the point that was rejected. We have to be fair in how we apply the rules to all of the applicant states.

As with the other Balkan countries, Serbia’s gradual integration into the European Union is the surest guarantee of peace in that region and in the future, and, at this critical time, this would also reinforce the Union’s own identity, one that has got lost, as a harbinger of peace and social justice.</p>

      <p sl="en">The whole thing has been put together in order to prevent the national principle. I favoured the right of the Albanians of Kosovo to determine their own future however they wanted: if they wanted independence, good luck to them. If they wanted union with Albania or confederation with Serbia, that was for them to decide. Of course, the flipside of that is that the Serbs in Kosovo have their own right of self-determination. In fact, we have a de facto border now. But accepting the validity de jure of that border would call into question the intellectual foundation of the European project, built as it is on the presumption that national loyalties are transient, arbitrary and discreditable. God help us when, like so many past empires, the EU applies the lessons learnt in its colonies to its metropolitan core.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Kosovo still has many internal issues to face before it can really be seen as on the path to joining the EU. Its troubled history means it has a long way to go in order to meet the many criteria of EU accession. The continued problems over the return of internally displaced people, as well as the treatment of Roma and minority groups more generally, should be addressed as a matter of priority.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I have a huge problem with voting on enlargement of the European Union to include Kosovo because I think Kosovo should join the European Union as part of Serbia. This is because I do not acknowledge and cannot in good conscience countenance any argument which supports the terrible violation of the Serbian nation by a forced secession of this Serbian province from the country which gave it birth – a secession which, unfortunately, has received international support from some or even a majority of the European Union’s Member States. I would like to say that Kosovo today is not just a centre of organised crime, but is also a place in which persecution is being used against the ethnic Serbs who live there, and in which religious persecution is being used against Orthodox Christians, for whom the province has special and considerable significance. I would therefore like to say I am completely convinced that Kosovo is part of Serbia, and that it is as part of Serbia that Kosovo should become part of the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, the European Union’s most powerful tool of foreign policy is the prospect of EU membership. For it to achieve real change and reform, Kosovo should be offered the prospect of membership in a genuine, credible way. The European Union is committed to the defence of the multi-ethnic and multi-religious countries of the Western Balkans. This has to be based on democratic values, tolerance and multiculturalism.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations are the main condition for countries wanting to join the EU. Good neighbourly relations are also uniquely crucial for stability and security in the powder keg that is the Western Balkans. President Ahtisaari’s plan is an excellent framework for the resolution of the conflict in northern Kosovo. Kosovo’s territorial and political inviolability must be respected and upheld. True democracy and a viable market economy can only ripen in a country that respects the rule of law. The main priority of the Kosovo Government, and of the EULEX operation that supports it, must therefore be to fight corruption and organised crime.</p>

People say one thing when they are speaking on the record and they say a very different thing when chatting in the corridors. The real objection that a number of Members have to Turkish accession is based on numbers and based on voting weights. The last thing that committed euro federalists want is the admission of a populous, proud and patriotic Muslim country but, rather than saying that, we have played this game where we have enticed Turkey with a promise that we have no intention of fulfilling. In treating them in this way, we risk creating the very thing which we purport to fear, namely, an alienated and anti-Western state on our doorstep.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, although I welcome the moderate progress that has been made by Turkey since accession negotiations opened in 2005, further work on reform does still need to be carried out, as highlighted by this resolution. This is particularly pertinent in the reformation of its judiciary, ensuring there is a free press, freedom of expression for its citizens, and, importantly, the protection of minorities. Turkey is likely to be a vital ally to the EU in terms of security and ensuring prosperity in the longer term. It is therefore imperative that the EU continues to support measures to ensure lasting peace and stability.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, Turkey is a modern secular state with a rapidly expanding economy. However, as the progress report shows, Turkey still has a long way to go before it meets the criteria to become an EU member. There are three main areas where I feel Turkey needs to make considerable improvements. Firstly, Turkey is still lagging behind when it comes to equality between men and women. Secondly, Turkey must do more to protect the rights of minority communities, especially the Kurds. Kurds must be allowed to be educated in their own language. Thirdly, the country’s Foreign Minister has indicated that Turkey will refuse to work with the Cypriot Presidency from 1 July. Any country that does not recognise one of the 27 EU Member States is a questionable candidate.</p>
      <p sl="en">I call on Ankara to engage with the Cypriot Presidency. I also call on Ankara to prove it holds EU values and, as a sign of goodwill, withdraw its troops from the occupied part of Cyprus. Turkey needs to show statesmanship if it wishes to join the EU.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I have a problem, or rather two problems, with Turkey. Turkey’s membership of the European Union does not present me with any difficulties. This is on condition, however, that a solution is found to a problem which is, for me, an egregious violation of European solidarity: how can we propose membership of the European Union to Turkey in a situation in which Turkey supports the occupation of the sovereign territory of Cyprus – one of the European Union’s Member States? In addition to this, Turkey is still having huge problems with implementing the rights of national and religious minorities. On the one hand, we have the huge Kurdish issue, while, on the other, there are still instances of the persecution of Christians in Turkey. Without resolution of the two problems to which I have referred – the problem of the occupation of Cyprus and the problem of national and religious minorities – there can be no talk of European Union membership for Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I supported the report. The European Union and all its Member States and Turkey are already dependent on one another. Turkey has not reformed in the manner and according to the timetable agreed, and, unfortunately, negotiations have made sluggish progress. At the same time, Turkey is the only candidate country without visa waiver status. Access to the European Union should be made easier for researchers, students and members of civil society. Border control is Turkey’s stumbling block. The number of illegal immigrants entering the EU through the Greek-Turkish bottleneck is huge.</p>
      <p sl="fi">Turkey also has a role to play in achieving lasting peace, democratic progress, stability and prosperity, both in the Balkans and in the Middle East. Turkey needs to find a political solution to the Kurdish question. More effective political dialogue is required. There have to be greater opportunities for citizens of Kurdish origin to participate politically, culturally, socially and economically, and for them to feel that they are included. Children must also have the right to learn their own mother tongue in school.</p>

      <p sl="da">We have seen Norway do this, and it seems that companies are starting to de-list in order to avoid a 40% limit. Thus, it should be the shareholders who decide who is to sit on their boards, as it is their money after all.

On a number of the boards on which I sit, for example, we have benefited greatly from the presence of women. However, women should not be given seats on the board on the basis of quotas.

Better functioning of existing governance rules and recommendations is preferred to a new European strict rules-based system and I applaud the efforts of this report to maintain Member State jurisdiction in this area while having belief in the sharing of best practice.</p>

This also explains why I voted against this principle.

As the EIB begins to use more risk-based instruments and more complex types of leverage, we need to be very careful that the scrutiny of the EIB keeps pace with this change. While projects like Jeremie, in my own constituency in Wales, have been very effective in adding value to the initial capital provided by the EIB, thereby making money seem to go further, we must remember that more complex financial instruments can bring with them new risks.

I am opposed to imposing on banks, and on business in general, even the most legitimate of ideological measures.

      <p sl="en">In particular, the report criticises the citizenship test which is currently used in the UK to grant citizenship. I reject that criticism and would argue that the test utilised is proportionate and fair, especially given the subsequent social benefits that are enjoyed by all UK citizens. The report claims that such issues are obstacles to EU citizens’ rights. However, given the very large inward mobility of EU citizens to the UK, particularly amongst younger EU citizens, this would seem to suggest that existing processes are not a barrier to the free movement of individuals into my country. The EU should be a welcoming place for all European citizens and I would suggest that the UK is the destination of choice for many of our young because of such a welcome.</p>

      <p sl="nl">Madam President, in keeping with the policy of the Dutch Government, I take the view that Romania and Bulgaria should not be admitted to the Schengen area. In the present report, the Netherlands is being called upon, amongst other things, to drop this blockade.

      <p sl="pl">Madam President, I had a big problem with this report. This is because, on the one hand, it contains things which simply have to be supported. Generally speaking, the very fact that we are dealing with the rights of the European Union’s citizens is something which should be regarded very highly. However, I voted against the report because I think that too often, alongside things in it which are absolutely legitimate, we also address matters about which I do not even want to say whether or not they are legitimate, but they should be the exclusive competence of the Member States. I do not think it is either safe or good if the degree of harmonisation of our routes of development in the Member States of the European Union is to be greater that in the United States, where I think individual states have greater freedom in certain matters than this Parliament would like to allow the European Union’s Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fi">Madam President, I voted in favour of the report. Unfortunately, citizens’ rights are not always implemented in practice, even though they are clearly provided for in EU legislation. This only makes Europeans even more disillusioned with Europe’s integration process. To remove obstacles to citizens’ rights, it is important to stress the importance of mobility and education. The European Union should also emphasise the significance of lifelong learning, vocational training and further training. Education is the main way to reduce inequality and poverty. The Commission should take active steps to guarantee all citizens of the European Union the right to a high-quality basic and vocational education.</p>
      <p sl="fi">The Commission should also take account of those especially vulnerable groups that are at risk of exclusion, such as the Roma and people from third countries. They also have the same citizens’ rights as others. Furthermore, if citizens’ rights are to be implemented, it is also important to give greater importance to the culture, language, history and value of the various minorities – indigenous groups – living in the European Union, both within the groups themselves and among the rest of the population.</p>

      <p sl="en">Madam President, I voted against the 2010 EU citizenship report. Whilst, of course, the fundamental freedom of movement for EU citizens across the whole of the EU is something I support entirely, along with the three other fundamental freedoms, this report is far too prescriptive on the Member States, including ridiculous ideas like harmonising tax rules and these are, in my view, completely unjustified.</p>
      <p sl="en">I do not support the idea of allowing extra funding for the publicising of the European Year of Citizens, nor do I want to see more money given to Euronews from the EU taxpayers’ pockets. Euronews is a great news channel – I watch it myself – but it should be self-funding on a commercial basis. Furthermore, I do not feel that I can support a report which specifically criticises the United Kingdom – i.e. my own country – for its right-to-reside test, which is currently used to test candidates before they are granted welfare rights. I believe this to be an entirely fair process, especially given the benefits that can be received, once a test is passed, by all UK citizens equally.</p>

I do not agree with everything that is in it but certainly, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, and indeed in my own general work as an MEP, I am very conscious of the problems and obstacles that are faced by citizens when they are trying to exercise their right to free movement and, indeed, that of their families as well.</p>
      <p sl="en">Now in this context, I voted for the first part of Amendment 1 on freedom of movement for citizens, but the second part of Amendment 1 gave me some problems because I had some concerns about its wording when it asked that we recognise freedom of movement for all EU citizens, etc. on the basis of mutual recognition. I am very happy to support Directive 2004/38/EC, where freedom of movement for family members is guaranteed on the basis of legislation of the host Member State but not on any other basis. I also support that this directive should be strictly applied, as that will eliminate some of the obstacles I spoke of, when people are trying to exercise their rights to free movement, but I am not prepared to go beyond that.</p>

I should also emphasise the particularly important role played by the group in tackling the volatility of commodity prices in this industry. In the current economic climate, the transparency of both the primary market and derivatives market must be guaranteed. Another factor which must be taken into account is the environmental conditions, which have deteriorated significantly in the areas where the commodity is harvested.

In fact, enhanced cooperation between the main producers and the biggest consumers is vital with this aim in mind.</p>

It should be mentioned, however, that the IRSG Panel of Associates, which is open to organisations involved in the rubber industry, will inevitably be exposed to the interests and influence of multinationals, which may even extend to the group itself.

      <p sl="it">The amendments that were made to the rules of procedure of the International Rubber Study Group in July 2011 take into account the developments and new legal status of the European Union within this worldwide organisation that was established in 1944. Over the years, membership numbers have fallen and some countries have left, despite its central role in market transparency and in fighting market abuse. The changes made seem to be effective and, as the rapporteur has specified, Parliament as an institution must support and approve the conclusions.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In October 2011, the European Parliament was asked to give its consent to the Council’s conclusion on behalf of the European Union of the amended constitution and rules of procedure of the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG). The rapporteur for this file convened a number of stakeholders for an exchange of views, which took place at the meeting of the Committee on International Trade on 20 December 2011. It was clear from this meeting that the IRSG is the only inclusive platform grouping both rubber producing and rubber consuming countries. Furthermore, the IRSG still is, in spite of its shortcomings, the most appropriate body to work on increasing the transparency that is lacking in the physical market and is badly needed to ensure fair, predictable and affordable access to rubber all around the world. For all these reasons, and in line with the rapporteur’s conclusions, I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of this document because I believe it is vital to make every effort to increase the membership of the International Rubber Study Group by engaging with the main rubber producing and consuming countries. The fact that some of the world’s largest rubber producing and consuming countries are not members of the group weakens the authority of this organisation and its function as a platform for discussion. The revision of the constitution and rules of procedure of the group could ensure that it is relaunched as an essential forum for improving transparency in rubber markets and market trends, and hence for taming price volatility for this commodity.</p>

      <p sl="it">The International Rubber Study Group (IRSG), founded in 1944, has suffered a loss of credibility in recent years since Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia no longer belong to it. China and the United States, the world’s largest and third largest rubber consumers respectively, have also pulled out. Individual European countries are now represented in the IRSG by the European Commission. I am in favour of this report because the supply of rubber is a problem that affects Europe’s industry and is closely connected to the wider debate on raw materials. The risk that market supply will be constrained, as is occurring with rare earths, could cause problems for our industries and favour those in rubber producing third countries.</p>

      <p sl="it">In the past few years, major price rises and high volatility have impacted a number of commodities, including natural rubber. Analysis has demonstrated that at the origin of these developments are: rising demand, particularly from China; constrained short-term supply; few rubber trees planted; and heavy rains in the major producing countries. These factors combined have placed the global supply of rubber under pressure. Greater transparency in rubber markets is therefore required. This vote strengthens the International Rubber Study Group, which is the most appropriate body to ensure fair, predictable and affordable access to rubber all around the world. Every effort should also be made to increase the membership of the group by engaging with the principal rubber producing and consuming countries.</p>

      <p sl="lt">I voted in favour of this resolution on the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air. This resolution is the European Parliament’s response to the recently published communication from the Commission on the regulation on common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. I agree with the rapporteur that information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey. I believe that there must be qualified staff at airports who can be contacted and who can take immediate decisions in the event of disruption, with regard to assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues. In the event of disruption to travel, passengers should be provided in a timely manner with information covering reasons for the delay or cancellation, the expected duration of the delay and alternative travel options, including other modes of transport if possible. The triple choice for the passenger between refunding, re-routing and rebooking, as a basic right, should also be highlighted. I believe that the European Parliament has adopted this resolution at just the right time because next year, the Commission intends to review legislation in this area. I call on the Commission to take this resolution into account in future when reviewing the Package Travel Directive and the Airport Package.</p>

The amendments targeted by this legislative proposal outline a clear, consistent framework for protecting passengers’ interests and rights without, however, omitting the responsibilities incumbent upon them as beneficiaries of transport services. It is important for European passengers to be able to enjoy services provided in good time and have the means for disputing and obtaining redress for any losses caused as a result of interactions with airlines.</p>

      <p sl="fr">We introduced, several years ago, European legislation to regulate the practices of airline companies and to protect us from their abuse. However, our rights as air passengers continue to be flouted on a regular basis and that is why I supported Mr Taylor’s report. Air passenger rights in the event of delay, cancellation and overbooking must be respected and it is our duty to act as spokespersons for citizens on these issues. The rules will be more precise, particularly regarding the notions of ‘extraordinary circumstances’ and ‘cancellation’. This lack of precision gives room for manoeuvre which still allows airline companies to misleadingly describe a plane which takes off 24 hours after the scheduled time as ‘delayed’ in order to avoid compensating the passenger. I also supported the idea of blacklisting unfair terms: for example, non-transferability of tickets, or the prohibition to use the ongoing part of a return ticket.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this report because I welcome the fact that the rights of passengers travelling by air need to be given adequate protection. I should emphasise how important it is for all the information about the terms of travel to be accessible to passengers right from the time when they have bought their ticket, in the language in which the booking was made and in the easiest possible format to understand. I am also thinking about ensuring transparency regarding the ticket’s final price and all the extra charges and costs which can be applied. It is of paramount importance for passengers to be able to receive information and assistance quickly in the case of unforeseen events affecting the flight, such as cancellations or huge delays. In this situation, I support the proposals for having contact persons or services available at airports and setting up accessible and efficient telephone assistance centres by airlines. I should mention that simpler procedures are required for lodging potential complaints or submitting claims for compensation or refunds. I welcome the idea of introducing a European award for the most consumer-friendly airline. I think that this will boost competition and allow best practices to be fostered.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Knowledge of rights is essential in ensuring that passengers can access them. This information should therefore be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way from the time the ticket is booked. This report, for which I voted, calls for contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement or re-routing as a result of flight disruptions. It considers efficient, transparent and independent enforcement bodies to deal with passenger complaints, to help resolve disputes between passengers and air carriers, and to ultimately impose sanctions if necessary, to be vital. Equally important is the need for passengers to be fully covered in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the airline. Lastly, I would emphasise that one of the most basic rights of passengers is to a safe journey. The report therefore considers it essential that all passengers, including children younger than two years, are ensured a safe seat on the plane.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Reinforcing the rights of air passengers: that certainly is a job for the European Union! Over the last few years, the EU has already taken action to strengthen passengers’ rights; however, there is still more work to be done. This is especially true in situations where passengers are stranded or delayed, in which case air carriers have a duty to provide information and assistance, simplify claims and pay compensation. Rules on hand luggage are another bone of contention. Each carrier now has its own criteria on weight and size, and passengers find this very confusing. The rules should therefore be harmonised in order to make them more transparent. Lastly, it is essential that booking systems be made more flexible, with more facility for cancellations and alterations. In short, in this resolution, we have diagnosed the problem and are calling for action.</p>

In my view, to help ensure that rights are upheld, there should be contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues that arise when flight disruptions occur. I agree with the rapporteur in calling for formalisation of a European network of efficient, independent bodies, coordinated by the Commission, and for these bodies to publish information on the complaints they receive from passengers. Lastly, I believe that passengers should enjoy the right to change the details on their ticket in case of a mistake without incurring a fee for doing so, thus counteracting the general proliferation of unfair terms in air carrier contracts, which is a widespread practice among many air carriers.</p>

The report adopted today by the European Parliament proposes that in future, passengers should be fully covered in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of an airline and that price transparency should be ensured. It is also proposed that in future, passengers should have the right to change their details, if they have made an error when purchasing tickets, without incurring a fee. Finally, the report calls for passengers to be allowed access to the Passenger Name Record held on them by the air carrier, and which is later used by security services in different countries to combat terrorism.</p>

      <p sl="en">In revising Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, the Commission should clarify the concept of ‘extraordinary circumstances’ and define the concept of ‘flight cancellation’, and also adopt rules governing the provision of assistance and the right to financial compensation and damages. At the same time, I think it is a good idea to take account of the level of protection provided to passengers by the European Court of Justice, and also the Court’s interpretation of the concept of ‘extraordinary circumstances’. At present, there is some uncertainty over the rules on compensation, and the differing approaches to enforcement of these rules at Member State level cannot be considered acceptable in view of events such as the crisis in 2010 caused by volcanic ash. In this context, the Commission should create a unified, complete and detailed system for assessing the probative value of evidence presented by the airline companies for the purposes of demonstrating ‘extraordinary circumstances’. In this context, I believe there is an urgent need to establish clear rules regarding the content, accessibility, timing and accuracy of information provided to air passengers which might have a bearing on the reasons for flight delays or cancellations, the expected duration of flight problems and alternative means of travel that are available to passengers.</p>

I also find the current legislation lacking with regard to the measures that air carriers must adopt in the event of flight cancellations or severe delays, and therefore I am fully in favour of requiring them to provide information on alternative travel options and temporary accommodation in such cases.

      <p sl="fr">By adopting this report, we really hoped to draw the Commission’s attention to the large number of grey areas that still exist in air passenger rights. The report has the merit of examining everything that really needs improving for people who travel by air, and the list of measures to be adopted is very long. The fact is that air passengers are all too often tricked when they book their flight tickets. For example, in the case of online bookings, I deplore the fact that some companies raise the stated price for a whole variety of reasons. Fares should therefore be more transparent, and purchasers should subsequently be able to change their reservations or correct minor errors at no additional cost. Another example relating to families is that children under the age of two years should be entitled to a seat and not have to spend the whole flight on their parents’ laps. People with reduced mobility should be able to travel with the equipment they need without being charged extra.

For a wide variety of reasons, such as strikes, weather conditions, breakdowns, etc., passengers often find their flights cancelled or considerably delayed, or they are prevented from boarding, causing them serious disruption and loss. This report, by Mr Taylor, addresses the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air, subsequent to the communication from the Commission on the application of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to such passengers. I voted for this report because I believe it is vital for all passengers to be provided with essential information, which should be communicated in a simple, understandable way from the time a passenger decides to book a ticket. In addition, it is essential to have efficient, independent bodies responsible for enforcing European rules on the right to complain, as well as on dispute resolution and/or guaranteed assistance, reimbursement or compensation. Lastly, I would mention the need to guarantee the right of people with disabilities or reduced mobility to travel safely and in comfort.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report reflects general concerns about air passenger rights. We believe these concerns are fair, albeit framed in the competitive context of this sector’s liberalisation, which, in itself, threatens one of the fundamental rights of these passengers: the right to safe, high-quality, public transport. We welcome the safeguarding of passengers’ rights, in particular, in relation to compensation and reimbursement for lost, delayed or damaged baggage, as well as for delayed or cancelled flights. We also welcome the reference to the rights of passengers with reduced mobility, pregnant women and children. On the other hand, we are concerned by the report’s attempt to impose uniformity in a number of services in order to create a ‘level playing field’, namely, by creating an official European network of national enforcement bodies with a clear mandate to improve cooperation on exchanging information, best practices and their databases. Moreover, we have further concerns about current security trends, such as the use of body scanners and behavioural profiling, amongst other techniques, which do not comply with passenger data protection or respect a passenger’s right to privacy, non-discrimination and public health.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of the report because it points out the need for enhanced legal certainty, more interpretative clarity and uniform application of the regulations across the EU regarding the rights of air passengers, including those with reduced mobility. Greater and more effective cooperation among the different actors must be secured so as to ensure that passenger rights are protected and to clarify their various responsibilities. It is also important to clarify and strengthen existing rights and to ensure that consumers are made aware of them. Knowledge of rights is essential in ensuring that passengers can access them. That is why information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey, starting from when the passenger is considering whether to purchase a ticket. To help ensure that rights are upheld, there should be contact personnel at airports who can take immediate decisions in relation to providing assistance, reimbursement, re-routing and other issues that arise when flight disruptions occur.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The submitted report sets out to address the recent Commission communication on ‘the application of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights’ and the report from the Commission on ‘the functioning and effects of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 of 5 July 2006 concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air’. Knowledge of rights is essential to ensuring that passengers can access these rights. That is why information on passenger rights should be communicated in a simple, appropriate and understandable way throughout the key stages of a journey. Efficient, transparent and independent enforcement bodies are vital for dealing with passenger complaints, helping to resolve disputes between passengers and air carriers and ultimately imposing sanctions if necessary. There is a need to ensure consistency between the different legislations on air passenger rights, and thus follow travel market trends whereby consumers increasingly arrange their travel themselves. Concerning the rights of disabled air passengers and passengers with reduced mobility, I believe it is necessary to secure equal travel opportunities for these people and non-discrimination guaranteeing equal access and unrestricted services.</p>

      <p sl="it">The rapporteur’s intention of encouraging greater transparency and effectiveness with regard to passengers’ rights by revising the 2004 regulation on the subject is commendable. It has been made necessary both by rapid changes in commercial practices and by the risks of unexpected natural phenomena, which, in recent years, have laid bare the many gaps in the system of passenger protection, particularly in relation to delays and cancellations. However, some of the proposals put forward in the report are contradictory and would prove inadequate in addressing the priorities in question. The rules designed to strengthen the Commission’s role in this field, for example, run the risk of introducing excessive interference in companies’ commercial practices, contrary to free-market principles, and increasing costly and pointless red tape. For these reasons, I decided to abstain.</p>

      <p sl="hu">Today, we adopted a report that will have an incredibly beneficial effect on the more than 800 million people travelling by air in the airspace of the European Union each year. This is a major step forward considering that the relevant regulations have hardly changed over the past few years and that, at the time of their adoption, the volume of air transport was lower than today. It is welcome that the report makes it clear that there is a need for enhanced legal certainty, more interpretative clarity and uniform application of the regulations across the EU. This is also relevant because the Commission is planning to review Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 next year. One of the most important measures is to provide passengers with information about their rights in a clear and appropriate manner and in a readily comprehensible language throughout key stages of the journey, starting from when the passenger is considering whether to book a ticket. The report is also notable for facilitating the future revision of other laws, such as the Package Travel Directive and the Airport Package.</p>

      <p sl="en">Air passengers lose time and money when their flights are delayed, overbooked or cancelled, but they are not always aware of their rights under EU law. In addition to the problem of awareness, passengers also struggle with drawn-out complaint procedures which delay access to redress. Therefore, I support a number of clauses in this report which call on Member States to ensure that passengers’ rights are enforced in a uniform way and within reasonable deadlines. Furthermore, I agree that passengers should be properly protected in the event of airline insolvency, bankruptcy or withdrawal of an operating licence, although I would point out that national authorities are already tasked with assessing the financial fitness of carriers licensed in their territory.</p>
      <p sl="en">However, I would like to have seen more acknowledgement of the unique realities faced by small-island Member States on the periphery of the Union. When reviewing transport policy, the Commission should be aware that one size does not fit all. While providing an even playing field and ample competition, the Commission should also properly consider the individual particularities of airlines requiring State aid, for example, those that provide necessary transport services for citizens, or the cargo services that are fundamental to economic activity.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Cancelled flights, lost baggage, delays, overbooking, etc. are all dysfunctions that are currently poorly addressed by the regulations in force. What was needed, therefore, was a new framework and new instruments to guarantee air passengers’ rights in all circumstances. That has now been achieved through this resolution, which, above all, provides greater transparency both in the information given when flights are delayed or cancelled and also in the prices that airlines advertise. Together with this need for transparency, there was also a need to improve the assistance given to passengers. Accordingly, this resolution states that passengers in difficulty should be able to talk directly to contact personnel who can provide immediate solutions and answers. In addition, the report considers that, if luggage is delayed by more than six hours, compensation should be offered that is proportionate to passengers’ needs so that they have the items they need while waiting for their luggage to arrive. Lastly, the resolution stresses that persons with reduced mobility should be given easier access to aircraft.</p>

      <p sl="de">Above all, I welcome the fact that it emphasises the need for greater legal certainty.

Faced with regular delays and a lack of information, Parliament has drawn up recommendations guaranteeing full recognition of passengers’ rights. Among its demands, Parliament has called for better provision of information for passengers with contact personnel from each company to be present at airports, price transparency, a clamp-down on the proliferation of abusive clauses, clarification of passenger compensation criteria and improvements in the handling of persons with reduced mobility.</p>

Passengers’ rights are currently governed by Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006, and also on the grounds of judgments handed down in this area by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Our objective is to achieve the greatest degree of transparency in applicable legislation and to improve the rights of passengers travelling by air. Common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delays of flights are very important to guarantee that passengers who use air transport in the Union have the right level of insurance and to safeguard respect for their rights.

I believe it is of paramount importance that EU passengers are better aware of their rights when faced with flight cancellations, long delays or sudden announcements of airline bankruptcy.

      <p sl="en">All airlines operating in the EU must inform passengers of their rights and respect the rules in good faith. We cannot continue with the present chaotic situation in respect of enforcement, where levels of protection vary widely depending on the Member State of departure and the operating company involved.

      <p sl="pl">In view of the fact that increasing numbers of European Union citizens are giving considerable importance to their mobility in terms of both work and recreation, it is extremely important from our point of view to ensure the highest possible quality of travel. Air travel, because of the much shorter journey times and greater convenience involved, attracts a considerable amount of interest from our citizens. It is therefore extremely important to ensure that people travelling by air have a full range of rights. The European Parliament has already used its law-making powers to bring in several pieces of legislation which protect people travelling by air.</p>

The role of enforcement bodies has been increased, and the demand for merging them into a European network will help improve cooperation between them and, therefore, the results achieved. I voted in favour of increasing transparency and accountability, and for improving the process for resolving complaints. On this point, I called for a single complaints form to be introduced at European level. I called for operators and airlines to provide regular reports with the aim of making the enforcement bodies more efficient and boosting competition.

      <p sl="pt">I am voting for this report, drafted by Mr Taylor, on rights for passengers travelling by air, as it calls for enhanced legal certainty in the interpretation and application of EU regulations. Air travel has greatly increased in Europe, but there has not been a policy to increase information along with it, and there are still major shortcomings in observing passengers’ rights. The most important passenger right is the right to services provided as scheduled, based on the contractual obligation which arises from selling a ticket. It is vital that passengers are aware of their rights in order to ensure that they can exercise them. I am voting in favour as I agree that people with reduced mobility should benefit from greater accessibility and be aware of their rights. I agree that passenger rights should be communicated in the language used during the booking of the ticket, throughout key stages of the journey. It is important to ensure the rights of passengers with children, enabling them to board easily with pushchairs, and to board and disembark first. It is also vital to ensure the triple choice for the passenger between refunding, re-routing and rebooking in the event of a disrupted journey as a basic right, as this report advocates.</p>

      <p sl="de">In principle, the EU has strengthened the rights of travellers in recent years. Although corresponding arrangements for airline passengers already exist, the question of whether airlines have to offer general compensation to their passengers in the event of major delays is still the subject of dispute. A landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice is also pending in this regard. Airlines are refusing to pay financial compensation if ‘exceptional circumstances’ arise, referring to an obligation under international law whereby they may be required to provide their passengers with hotel accommodation and food in the event of a delay, but not compensation. Also in dispute is the question of whether an airline has to compensate passengers if they miss their connecting flight due to a delay. It is therefore important that the EU should deal with this issue again, although a number of issues nevertheless remain unresolved, such as the rigorous security provisions.

      <p sl="en">However, some areas of the report proved problematic for my group. We believe that the section of the report which would allow bookings to be cancelled up to two hours after the original reservation could be problematic for airlines and travel companies.</p>

      <p sl="it">The regulation on the application of air passengers’ rights establishes a uniform level of assistance that should certainly mitigate the difficulties that are often caused by cancellations, long delays or denied boarding. It is essential that passengers can be made aware of their rights in a simple and understandable way; that they are able to change the details on their tickets at no extra cost; that they are informed promptly in the event of cancellation or breakdown of the aircraft; and that they can choose from the options of refunding, re-routing and rebooking. Another requirement that deserves to be highlighted and with which I agree is barrier-free access and equal travel opportunities for persons with reduced mobility. The lack of trained staff and facilities to overcome the obstacles that these people often encounter is an urgent problem that must be addressed.</p>

      <p sl="fi">I voted in favour of this report because it is important that high standards of consumer protection are also ensured in the area of air transport. Transport by air raises several matters of concern from the perspective of consumer protection. One example is the unfair contract terms generally in use and relating to the transferability and cancellation of tickets. I welcome the call for measures that would make it possible to correct minor booking errors free of charge and without having to engage in laborious procedures. In the matter of air travellers’ rights, the main focus needs to be on the importance of informing passengers of their rights and on simplifying processes. Many travellers do not exercise their rights, either because they do not know of their existence in general, or because they worry about the awkward complaints procedures involved. For this reason, the information given must be timely and comprehensive. The importance of announcements is all the greater when services are disrupted, as they were in the flight chaos caused by the ash cloud.</p>

      <p sl="it">Mr Taylor’s report was put to the vote today during the Brussels plenary session. His report seeks to strengthen the rules on assistance and reimbursement in the event of flight cancellations or delays, including baggage delays of more than six hours. EU legislation has done a great deal to enhance air passengers’ rights, but it needs to do more to ensure that they are treated fairly and that all travellers are afforded more extensive rights. The salient points of the resolution include calling on the Commission to draw up a standard complaints form, translated into all EU languages; to harmonise the rules on hand luggage; to put an end to unfair commercial practices, unilateral rescheduling of flights and price discrimination on the basis of a passenger’s country of residence; and to detail the environmental impact of travel on air tickets. In addition, passengers should have the right to cancel or change a reservation free of charge within two hours of the time of booking.

      <p sl="en">In today’s vote, I supported the own-initiative report of the rapporteur, Keith Taylor, on the functioning and application of the established rights of people travelling by air, as this involves an important challenge to the Commission to submit proposals as quickly as possible for addressing the ever increasing number of complaints by European air travellers. It is not acceptable that, according to statistics, 57% of the total number of 44 000 transport complaints in 2010 concerned passenger rights in air transport. Airline companies must start treating their customers more fairly, providing them with clear information in a language they understand, and in case of problems or of their own bankruptcy, organise their payment-free and rapid transport back home. The Commission must submit amendments to Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 along these lines, as a result of which, the obligation incumbent upon airline companies, above all, to fulfil their obligations vis-à-vis passengers will also be more enforceable in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or loss of licence. I also support the creation of a unified system for assessing the evidence demonstrating ‘exceptional circumstances’. This is the excuse most often put forward by airline companies unwilling to compensate passengers for damages. The demand for passengers to be entitled to comprehensive information on their rights in the language in which the reservation was made is also an important challenge.</p>

      <p sl="it">On the subject of air passenger rights, the concept of ‘extraordinary circumstances’ and the definition of ‘cancellation’ both need clarification. The lack of uniformity in the Member States’ regulations and the behaviour of the various airlines make it necessary to develop a unified, complete and detailed system to assess the value of evidence submitted by airlines in order to demonstrate the existence of ‘exceptional circumstances’. With this vote, we are, in fact, seeking to harmonise the field and guarantee passengers all their rights and the greatest possible transparency. There is a need for timing and accuracy in the information communicated to air passengers, which should cover the reason for any delay or cancellation, the expected duration of disruptions and what happens in the event of overbooking, not forgetting the alternative travel options available to passengers.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am extremely pleased that this report has been adopted, as it strengthens passenger rights across the board. However, in my original draft report, I urged the Commission to propose an obligation on air carriers to provide a final guarantee covering their liabilities towards passengers in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or removal of an operating licence. The reference to a final guarantee was weakened at the vote in the Transport and Tourism Committee, confining the proposal to support for stranded passengers to be repatriated in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, ceased operations or removal of an operating licence. Although I welcome this measure, it is not as strong as the original wording, and I call on the Commission to look into the possibility of proposing a final guarantee to protect passengers when they revise Regulation No 261/2004.</p>

Finally, it puts particular emphasis on the rights of people with reduced mobility, including families with children and disabled persons. Price transparency and compensation if airlines go bankrupt should be uniform rights across the various Member States. In the event of disruption to travel, the triple choice between refunding, re-routing and rebooking should be offered to all passengers immediately. Moreover, information should be accessible and a permanent point of contact should be available for any changes after booking. In addition, I believe that it is important to consider protective measures in relation to lost and delayed baggage, as well as allowing the consumer to correct booking details free of charge or cancel an online reservation within two hours.</p>

In this regard, the report contains a proposal that information on passenger rights be communicated in a more transparent and understandable way throughout key stages of the journey. Passengers should have the opportunity to correct obvious mistakes made when making a booking or even to withdraw completely from a reservation within two hours of booking. Airlines should be banned from collecting excessive fees when passengers make payments by credit card and we should be uncompromising in enforcing the rights of parents travelling with young children. Furthermore, carriers must be required to consider all passenger complaints within a maximum of two months.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the resolution on the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air because it is vital for both air carriers and tourism operators to provide passengers with complete, comprehensible, accurate and timely information. We call on air carriers to ensure that they have at every airport from which they operate contact personnel or a service that can make immediate decisions, in particular, with regard to assistance, reimbursement, re-routing, lost or delayed luggage and rebooking, and with whom complaints can be lodged. We call on the Commission to implement and enforce the existing legislation on price transparency effectively in order to ensure that the advertised price is an accurate reflection of the final price. We call for passengers to be protected against unfair contractual terms, such as contractual issues related to damaged/delayed/mishandled luggage, the transferability of tickets, force majeure circumstances, the unilateral rescheduling of flights, the ban on using the ongoing part of a return ticket, and excessive hand luggage restrictions. We support putting an end to abusive practices whereby persons with reduced mobility (PRMs) are required to sign a document waiving the air carrier’s liability for any damage caused to their mobility equipment.</p>

      <p sl="it">I voted in favour of Mr Taylor’s own-initiative report because it calls on the Commission to intervene both to enforce existing legislation and to promote and simplify the use of the instruments that protect air passenger rights. This report emphasises the legal certainty of passengers’ rights, their right to information, and the independence and operational transparency of the independent enforcement bodies that can impose penalties for infringements and resolve disputes between passengers and the industry. All too often, passengers find that they are the victims of the abusive practices of air carriers, which take advantage of passengers’ lack of information about their own rights in order to delay or cancel flights arbitrarily without accepting the liability that they should accept by law. I hope, therefore, that this report can provide useful suggestions for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, which is expected to take place next year.</p>

      <p sl="en">I believe further legislative measures to protect air passengers’ rights are necessary, particularly in cases of long delays or cancellation. That is why I voted in favour of the report on the functioning and application of established rights of people travelling by air. Airlines should give stranded passengers better information and immediate help, and this can be achieved if the Commission tightens the rules on help and compensation for flight cancellations or delays, including luggage delays of longer than six hours. I believe, along with fellow MEPs, that passengers with reduced mobility or with disabilities must be granted barrier-free access to air travel, including the right to use mobility devices.

      <p sl="cs">I did not vote in favour of the report. This is not because I am opposed to passenger rights. It is not because I am opposed to the demand for unified complaint handling. It is not even because I am opposed to greater awareness and more information for passengers. When Wizzair left 180 Czech passengers in Barcelona in February this year, announcing that it would not refund their money, I realised how toothless a right can be in the real world, and how powerless passengers are in reality. However, we need to understand that nothing is for free. If wonderful rights are defined for passengers in relation to delayed flights, delayed baggage, assistance for people with disabilities and so on, we need to understand that someone will have to pay for it. The demand for financial costs to be borne only by carriers and not by passengers, as the report proposes, is unrealistic in my view. When we buy a ticket for EUR 1 from a low-cost airline, we should not expect that if the flight is two hours late, we have an automatic entitlement to refreshments, telephone calls or another form of compensation exceeding the original price of the ticket. In this regard, we should create a dual system in the future, enabling passengers to choose when it comes to the price of the ticket and the related comfort and certainty of travel. We cannot simply protect passengers regardless of the cost.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Air traffic has expanded hugely in Europe with the increased competition in the sector, new and shorter routes and cheaper fares. Slashing prices, however, is no justification for trampling on passengers’ rights. I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, in which I have invested a great deal of effort and which sets out our demands for the revision of the rules protecting passengers. Following this vote, what I expect from the Commission most of all is that it guarantees the right to board an aircraft with purchases made at the airport without incurring abusive charges. In my view, the restrictive commercial practices in this field are actually a step back in time for passengers and create a form of unfair competition for ground-based duty-free shops. I also believe the Commission should come up with concrete proposals to curb the practice of overbooking, which leaves thousands of passengers waiting every year. It is vital to find a better way of reconciling this technique for filling planes with provision of the service according to the conditions stated when the ticket was purchased, which is the most basic right there is.</p>

      <p sl="lv">As regards air passengers’ rights, many EU legislative requirements are no longer new; they are well-known, and the situation has improved in recent years. However, the charges made by airlines for payment administration and for the use of bank cards, especially credit cards, for example, are still problematic and confusing. These extra payments are not included in the price of the ticket, and when buying their ticket, passengers are not informed on time: they see these extra charges only when they have already chosen the ticket and are making the purchase. That is why airlines are being asked, especially with respect to credit cards, to recoup only what it really costs them to service the credit card or other card. The second topical issue is the wide variation in weight restrictions currently applied to hand luggage by airlines. Passengers find it difficult to navigate their way around these, which is why these rules should be harmonised. The EU should likewise simplify the method for investigating complaints, and it should be uniform. Currently, both the procedures and the time limits for investigating complaints differ from country to country. Although many of the proposals contained in the report, including the review of various definitions, have already been appropriately solved at an international level in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), on the whole, nevertheless, the leitmotiv of the report on the functioning and application of the established rights of people travelling by air – that it is still necessary both to monitor airlines even more closely and to develop clearer and stricter regulations – is right and needs to be supported.</p>

Mr de Magistris, who was elected as a Member in 2009, was summoned before the Court of Catanzaro, Italy, by Maurizio Mottola di Amato in connection with two legal documents that Mr de Magistris had published on his website in early 2011, which formed part of a criminal case from the time when Mr de Magistris was a public prosecutor. Mr di Amato accuses Mr de Magistris of making ‘false and libellous accusations against him and his wife’, who worked as a judge at the Court of Catanzaro. Mr de Magistris submits that in his role as Member of the European Parliament, he had a duty to inform Italian citizens about what was happening at the court of Catanzaro, and that the documents, which have since been removed from his website, were not of a confidential nature. Given that the facts of the case demonstrate that the details published ‘have a direct, obvious connection with Luigi de Magistris’s performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament’, and in view of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I am voting in favour of defending the privileges and immunities of Mr de Magistris.</p>

Against this background, the committee considered that the facts of the case, as manifested in the writ of summons and in Luigi de Magistris’s written submissions and oral presentations to it, indicate that the statements made do have a direct, obvious connection with Luigi de Magistris’s performance of his duties as an MEP.

      <p sl="pt">Luigi de Magistris, a Member of the European Parliament, was summoned before the Court of Catanzaro by Mr Maurizio Mottola di Amato in connection with two articles that Mr de Magistris had published on his website in early 2011, which featured copies of legal documents. Mr de Magistris considers it altogether proper to inform Italian citizens about court documents and, in this case, the documents were not covered by any confidentiality provisions.

The Committee on Legal Affairs concluded that Mr de Magistris was acting in the performance of his duties as a Member of the European Parliament, and has therefore decided to defend the privileges and immunities of Mr de Magistris.

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Mr Rapkay, concerns the request for the defence of the parliamentary immunity of the Italian Member of the European Parliament, Luigi de Magistris. Mr de Magistris, who was elected a Member in 2009, was summoned before the Court of Milan, Italy, on behalf of Giancarlo Pittelli, due to the fact that in April 2010, he published a book called Assalto al PM, storia di un cattivo magistrato (‘Attack on the public prosecutor – the story of a bad magistrate’), in which, on pages 27, 58-60, 88-90 and 113-114, he questions Mr Pittelli’s ability to act as legal counsel for a defendant in the ‘Shock’ criminal case. Mr Pittelli considers the statements to be ‘very offensive to him’, since he is presented therein ‘as a member of a white-collar mafia, upholding inappropriately close relationships with the judiciary, businessmen and politicians’. Mr de Magistris maintains that he merely expressed his opinion ‘on important matters relating to the public interest’, and that the book is ‘an expression of the political activity of an MEP’.

This new programme strengthens the European Union’s role in terms of international protection and encourages the Member States to step up their refugee resettlement efforts and to focus on the most vulnerable groups, such as women and children. To date, 13 European countries have set up resettlement programmes.

Finally, an agreement has been reached with the Council, a process that was too long, owing to the inexplicable deadlock in the Council.

Ireland is one of the EU Member States that already takes part on a voluntary basis in resettlement programmes for refugees who have been granted refugee status in third countries. The revised decision should encourage more Member States to take part in resettling refugees next year, the final year of the current ERF, by increasing the amount of financial support Member States receive from the ERF for resettlements and by enlarging the list of those whose resettlement will be financed by the ERF next year to include vulnerable people such as children, women at risk, unaccompanied minors, persons with serious medical needs, etc. I would encourage all Member States to notify the Commission by the agreed deadline of 1 May of the number of refugees they will resettle next year.</p>

The European Parliament acknowledges the need to establish a list of priority people, particularly women and children, who should be resettled in places that ensure them the most basic fundamental rights. This list should go beyond the number of refugees protected by each Member State.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Refugees are normal people who find themselves in difficult situations for political, racial or socio-economic reasons. Around 200 000 people need to be resettled every year. Although the ideal situation would be repatriation, the truth is that they cannot return to their country of origin the majority of the time. This recommendation for second reading, by Mr Tavares, concerns the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 573/2007/EC establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’. In the past, Europe was a desirable destination for many refugees, who sought security and the chance of a new life in the EU. As solidarity is one of the EU’s oldest values, it is crucial that the Union continue to practise it, despite the present economic and financial crisis. I voted for this recommendation because it confirms a programme that will enable many more people at risk to enter the EU, thereby giving them a new opportunity.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The involvement of the EU in the asylum area is based on the need for solidarity between Member States in solving the challenges which individual Member States cannot address effectively in an EU without internal borders. The creation of a common EU programme for resettlement will ensure that a greater number of EU Member States participate in resettlement, which, at the same time, will help to show greater EU solidarity with third countries in the reception of refugees. With regard to the creation of a joint EU resettlement programme aimed at boosting the success of EU efforts in the area of resettlement, by providing protection to refugees and maximising the strategic impacts of resettlement through better targeting of those persons who are in greatest need of resettlement, common priorities should be formulated in the area of resettlement at EU level on a regular basis. It is therefore right that the Commission has decided on common annual priorities of the EU, taking into account specific geographic regions, specific nationalities and specific categories of refugees who must be resettled. Bearing in mind what is needed in the area of resettlement, I take the view that it is also essential to provide people with additional financial support (when resettlement is considered the most appropriate solution to their personal needs) in connection with specific geographical regions, specific nationalities and specific categories of refugee who must be resettled.</p>

In addition, the negotiations on this text, aimed at amending the decision establishing the European Refugee Fund in the light of the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme, have been going on for nearly two years. We cannot allow this situation to continue when there are thousands of refugees who could benefit from this programme. Indeed, resettlement is the only viable and safe solution as these people are often in an extremely vulnerable situation. The European Union must step up its resettlement efforts in order to protect refugees and maximise the impact of resettlement by focusing, where possible, on those most in need, in accordance with the common priorities established at EU level.</p>

The resettlement programmes are necessary: they enable refugees who cannot return to their country of origin or stay in the country where they have been granted international protection to be resettled in a country where their lives are not at risk.

The purpose of adopting this recommendation is to increase the number of Member States that resettle refugees, to which end those that do so for the first time will benefit from increased financial assistance for the first two years. The resettlement of the following must take priority, irrespective of any geographical priorities that the EU may have set for a given period: children and women at risk of violence or psychological, physical or sexual exploitation; unaccompanied minors; persons with special medical needs; survivors of violence and torture; and persons who need emergency resettlement for legal and protection reasons.

      <p sl="pt">The history of Europe is a history of emigration. For centuries, millions of Europeans have left seeking refuge, better living conditions or hope. Many travelled within Europe, but many more left for other continents. What country has not, at points in its history, had very difficult times when many of its nationals had to seek refuge outside its borders? People fleeing wars, democrats persecuted by fascist regimes, and economic emigrants from Ireland, Poland, Galicia, Italy, etc. It is therefore a moral imperative for Europe to create a European Refugee Fund that helps people in situations of extreme vulnerability to actually integrate. That is why I voted for this report. However, there is a need to go much further. Every day, children are arrested for being illegal immigrants. This practice is, unfortunately, widespread in countries like Malta, Greece, Italy and Hungary. These are children of only eight years’ old who are detained alone in reception centres or prisons.

The precise nature of the EU’s error is made implicitly clear when it comes to the ‘expansion of the resettlement programme’: the discrepancy between the everyday reality for the citizens of the older EU Member States at least and the pathological mania for change among many Eurocrats. Despite the huge integration problems experienced by many immigrants from completely different cultural backgrounds, resettlement programmes are to be expanded and granted even more funding. Anyone looking to bring refugees from safe third countries into the EU is demonstrating stupidity rather than solidarity. The most effective assistance would be to support third countries that are taking in refugees in both financial and structural terms and to back projects that promote peace and democracy, as well as humanitarian causes. The crazy idea that it is possible to offer every displaced person in the world a cosy refuge in the EU is simply self-destructive. It is only possible to offer sustainable aid at local level. The idea of aiding refugees is taken to absurd levels by permanently identifying certain groups as victims of persecution and pursuing this policy of resettlement. Anyone forced to leave their homeland because of the horror of war must be able to find sanctuary in a safe country. However, this should not involve permanent resettlement with a guarantee of prosperity. That is why I am voting against this report.</p>

Our policies on the area of freedom, security and justice have been developing on an ongoing basis for several years now. Their importance is confirmed by the Stockholm Programme and its Action Plan, the implementation of which is a strategic priority for the next five years, involving sectors such as migration, security and external border management.

It is therefore crucial that the Member States be able to make use of EU funds to improve their reception systems and to encourage resettlement. The only problem with the agreement finally reached on this matter is that it has come so late. The urgency is borne out by the statistics: there was a 15% increase in 2011 compared with the previous year. The 27 EU Member States as a whole received around 280 000 applications for asylum. The European Refugee Fund should deliver funding for actions in the interests of the European Union as a whole, but also actions at international or merely national level, with a view to creating a joint European Union resettlement programme.

As well as the vulnerability criterion, the Commission and Council are also imposing annual geographical priorities. To encourage the Member States to participate, there is an additional financial contribution of EUR 6 000 per person resettled in the first year, with the sum decreasing in subsequent years. The problem of refugees is an issue on which the EU should focus.

In order that the Member States and the European Union can meet their international commitments, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes a common list of dual use items and technologies referred to in Article 3 of the regulation, which implements internationally agreed controls on these items and technologies.

It is therefore necessary to make the necessary changes to ensure that the commitments made by EU Member States under these regimes will be fully applied throughout the EU.</p>

However, because I am an active supporter of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the heart of our economic fabric, I felt that it was important to protect them.

      <p sl="pt">As over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are contracts negotiated privately between the two parties involved without passing through any intermediary, identifying the nature and level of risk involved in these transactions is more complicated. This regulation is intended to lay down conditions for limiting the risks and to make these contracts more transparent. The regulation proposes concrete measures in this regard; specifically, the use of central counterparties, the guarantee that OTC derivatives are subject to compensation and the obligation to record them in trade repositories. Stress is given to the need to standardise requirements for derivative contracts, and stipulations for central counterparties and for trade repositories. This is an area that has been completely unregulated until now. This is the response to the call made by the G20 leaders in 2009, which contributes to increased stability in the financial markets.

      <p sl="ro">This initiative features among a wider series of actions carried out globally with the aim of bringing greater stability to the financial system in general, and to the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market in particular. As far as non-financial (corporatist) counterparties are concerned, in theory, they will not come under the provisions of this regulation, except when their positions on OTC derivatives reach a threshold regarded as being systemically important. Since it is assumed that, generally speaking, their operations with derivatives have a direct link more with commercial than speculative activities, the relevant positions will not be subject to this regulation. I think that the relevant national authorities should retain responsibility for granting authorisation (which also means rescinding authorisation that has been granted) and for supervision, since they are best placed to examine how central counterparties (CCPs) operate on a daily basis, to carry out regular reviews and to take appropriate action, where necessary. Given the systemic importance of CCPs and the cross-border aspect of their activities, it is important for the European Securities and Markets Authority to play a key role in authorising them.</p>

      <p sl="it">According to recent studies, global spending on technology for managing over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives alone increased from a little more than USD 1 billion in 2008 to USD 3.5 billion in 2009. These instruments are negotiated between private counterparties on a numerical scale unimaginable until a few years ago, on mainframe systems capable of carrying out thousands of transactions on the international market in a few seconds. The entire derivatives market continues substantially to lack guarantees against the risks generated and the systemic repercussions on the world’s productive fabric, which have escalated dramatically with the crisis that broke out in 2008, with what are called undertakings for collective investment in securities (UCITS) as the main players. In line with the resolutions of the G20 in Pittsburgh (2009) and Toronto (2010), the regulation lays the foundations for governance of the system based on the principles of risk mitigation, greater transparency of the market and operator responsibility, built on the strengthening and reforming of central counterparties in accordance with the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines.

It does not ban the use of derivatives or the involvement of so-called ‘middlemen’. However much we regulate and however much we tighten up supervision, the source of the problem remains, because we are talking about the effects, not the causes. In times of crisis, the role of the banking system is absolutely crucial, as it can mitigate the consequences of the crisis, provided that it puts the real needs of society first. As long as the existing system reproduces the philosophy of maximising profits and bonuses and continues to function on a speculative basis, to the detriment of society and the people of Europe, the problem will get worse and there will be no way out of the crisis.</p>

      <p sl="en">I endorse the new regulation on the over-the-counter derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. Derivatives are contracts that derive their value from price fluctuations on linked stocks, bonds, exchange or interest rates. These contracts, negotiated over the counter, were one of the main causes of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, with 80% traded bilaterally, off-exchange and with no clearing. By requiring all standardised derivates contracts to be centrally cleared, this regulation is a step forward in terms of transparency and stability in financial markets. It fills a regulatory gap and, after the recent agreement on the short-selling of credit default swaps, adds another brick to the wall of better financial regulation. All relevant information on derivative contracts will be reported to national and European authorities, thereby giving regulators a full picture of derivate markets traded both on- and off-exchange. I am disappointed that the Council refused the EP’s proposal to give a stronger role to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in authorising clearing houses, but I would hope this could be revisited in the planned review after three years.</p>

      <p sl="it">Since over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are negotiated directly between the parties and not traded on the financial markets, the competent authorities find it difficult to control these instruments. Given the lack of legislation on this matter, the need for regulation is pressing. I consider that derivatives, if used properly as a means of insurance, contribute to growth and global economic stability, but the recent financial crisis has made the risks underlying that market evident, and the danger is that a single operator’s insolvency may trigger a chain reaction throughout the entire system. This regulation contributes to financial stability by introducing mandatory central clearing for the majority of contracts, making capital requirements more stringent for those contracts that do not fall within that category, guaranteeing greater dialogue between the national competent authorities and ESMA, and requiring greater transparency from all counterparties. The approach that has been adopted is, moreover, consonant with the guidelines laid down by the G20 as regards financial stability. Consequently, and in the conviction that the new measures represent a significant step towards a financial market that is more sound and serves the real economy, I voted in favour of the regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR).</p>

      <p sl="fr">Today, the European Parliament adopted the interinstitutional political agreement on the proposal for a regulation aimed at providing a framework for derivative products. This is one of the cornerstones of Europe’s financial regulations in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the derivatives market was worth more than USD 700 000 billion in 2011, the lion’s share represented by foreign exchange derivatives, interest rate derivatives and issuer default risk contracts. The future regulation, which will enter into force at the end of 2012, aims to shed light on this market, where products have, to date, been traded primarily over the counter, thereby lacking any transparency. It requires the vast majority of standardised derivatives to be cleared in central clearing houses. All transactions involving derivatives, irrespective of whether they are carried out via regulated platforms or over the counter, will have to be reported to national registers, to which the national and European supervisors will have access. This information will be published. With these rules, the EP hopes that many of these products will be more expensive for the companies that use them and less profitable for the banks.</p>

According to the report, OTC derivatives lack transparency as they are privately negotiated contracts and the conditions of the deal are not public, making it difficult to identify the nature and level of risks involved, as the present financial crisis has demonstrated. As such, there is a need to create mechanisms making this entire process more transparent and limiting the risks of this business, thereby making the public safer and the economy more stable. They should therefore be compensated through central counterparties and communicated to trade repositories, with companies taking responsibility for the risks that they take.

      <p sl="pt">This legislative report on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives is enlightening with regard to the path followed up until the outbreak in 2008 of the profound economic and social crisis in which Europe is now mired. This crisis is the expression of the current stage of development of capitalism, characterised by a bloated financial sector resulting from the over-accumulation of capital whose expected profitability in the real economy is declining, as the law of diminishing returns is borne out. In 2008, a number of voices could be heard, even here in the European Parliament, demanding an end to financial derivatives, particularly OTC derivatives. These instruments were also at the root of the speculation on foodstuffs, which is inseparable from the savage instability in the prices of these goods that led to the food crises of 2007 and 2008. They are now back-pedalling across the board, as can be seen from the content of this report, which goes even less far in a number of respects than the initial Commission proposal. Financial derivatives currently represent an astronomical sum, equivalent to 10 times global GDP. This is a sign of the time bomb still ticking underneath the global economy which, following the warning in 2008, they still want to ignore.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The financial crisis has brought over-the-counter derivatives to the forefront of regulatory attention. The near-collapse of Bear Sterns in March 2008, the default of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008, and the bail-out of AIG the following day highlighted the shortcomings in the functioning of the over-the-counter derivatives market. Within that market, the regulatory authorities devoted particular attention to the role that credit default swaps (CDS) played during the crisis. In its broad communication of 4 March 2009 – ‘Driving European Recovery’, – the Commission committed to deliver, on the basis of a report on derivatives and other complex structured products, appropriate initiatives to increase transparency and to address financial stability concerns. All subsequent steps taken have been part of a larger international effort to increase the stability of the financial system in general, and the over-the-counter derivatives market in particular. Given the global nature of the over-the-counter derivatives market, an approach that is coordinated at the international level is crucial. It is therefore important that this proposal takes into account what other jurisdictions are planning to do, or what has already been done in the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives in order to avoid the risk of regulatory arbitrage.</p>

      <p sl="hu">In order to be able to ensure better and stricter regulation of derivatives markets, account must be taken of the particular situation of enterprises that are dependent on continuing to cover their financial and operational risks through favourable, tailor-made derivatives. As already pointed out by the Commission earlier, it is especially over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that contribute to the emergence of financial disturbances, seeing as how they enabled the increase in leverage and have led to increased dependency between market participants. This is one of the reasons why I support the guiding principle of the report that future legislative proposals concerning derivatives should follow a functional approach. It must therefore be emphasised that there is a necessity for European regulation in respect of derivatives. This is why we call on the Commission to coordinate the procedure as much as possible with Europe’s partners in order to ensure that regulation is as uniform and internationally coherent as possible. All this must, of course, be implemented in such a way as to avoid regulatory arbitrage resulting from inappropriate coordination.

These decisions were considered essential in order to improve the transparency of the financial markets, given that derivatives had a large part to play in aggravating the volatility of the markets during the 2008 crisis.

On 23 September 2009, the Commission adopted proposals for three regulations establishing the European System of Financial Supervision, including the creation of three European supervisory authorities (ESAs) to contribute to consistent application of Union legislation and to the establishment of high-quality, common regulatory and supervisory standards and practices. The three ESAs are the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (EBA), the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (EIOPA), and the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (ESMA).

It is therefore essential to keep ensuring that the development of their work is a matter of high political priority and that they are adequately resourced.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The financial products that financial institutions have created over the years have not been properly regulated, and this contributed to the severe financial crisis that they triggered in the past. The absence of a regulatory framework for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives also contributed to the financial crisis and its consequences. In view of this, and in order to address concerns about financial stability, in September of last year, the Commission tabled a proposal for regulating this market. The amendments that have been adopted by Parliament today are principally aimed at improving transparency and managing risk in the OTC derivatives market, so that the same mistakes are not repeated in future, with the severe consequences of which we are all aware. That is why I voted in favour.</p>

The European Union needed to have a complete and single set of regulations for all derivatives traded on both regulated and unregulated markets and greater powers for ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority. I am satisfied that despite the pressure brought to bear by certain states, the compromise we have reached has not introduced too many exemptions from the application of the rules and that ESMA’s supervisory powers have not been watered down. The document has included many of the amendments that were proposed, and which I supported, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. These were, in particular, those relating to extending the scope to cover all derivatives, whether over-the-counter or not, and introducing some different rules for non-financial counterparties having recourse to derivatives to finance certain activities and to hedge against risks, and for financial counterparties not indulging in speculation.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are contracts negotiated privately between the two involved parties without passing through any intermediary, identifying the nature and level of risk involved in these transactions is more complicated. This regulation is intended to lay down conditions for limiting the risks and making these contracts more transparent. The regulation proposes concrete measures in this regard; specifically, the use of central counterparties, the guarantee that OTC derivatives are subject to compensation and the obligation to record them in trade repositories. This report stresses the need to standardise requirements for derivative contracts, stipulations for central counterparties and trade repositories. I voted for this report, since this has been an area without any kind of regulation hitherto, and because it responds to the call made by the leaders of the G20 in 2009 while clearly contributing to financial market stability.</p>

      <p sl="it">Financial derivatives are broadly held to be one of the causes of the global financial crisis. The regulation adopted today addresses that by imposing transparency and requiring data to be made available to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), supervisory authorities and central banks. This represents a mainstay of financial market regulation. This approach will offer consumers and investors greater choice and more efficient services. ESMA will monitor the operation of these ‘repositories’ and will be able to authorise their registration or deny them registration. ESMA will also intervene in disputes between national authorities as regards authorisation of central counterparties. Pension funds will become subject to mandatory clearing only after three years, with a possible extension to five. Central counterparties from third countries will be recognised and allowed to operate only if the legal system of the countries in question provides for an equivalent recognition system.</p>

Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are more than an integral part of the modern financial system: they play a crucial role in the functioning of an efficient and competitive market. The final agreement on the regulation has taken into account key ECR concerns, including allowing for strong exemptions for non-financial players and appropriate treatment of pension funds. It has also provided for the key ECR objective of international convergence on exemptions for the FX derivatives markets that are so important for the functioning of global financial markets. I am confident that the system, if implemented correctly by ESMA, will enable our financial services industry to work well for participants at all levels, while at the same time ensuring the system security which was so lacking in the events of 2007-2008.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the proposal for a regulation on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories. The regulation sets out the conditions for authorising CCPs, the criteria for examination to ensure appropriate characteristics for central clearing, and the registration of derivatives in trade repositories where the aggregate information can be used to analyse systemic risks, amongst other things. CCPs are regulated by bank prudential regulators in most Member States, while, at European level, it is the European Banking Authority (EBA) that has the most expertise, making it essential for the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the EBA to work closely together. The amendments being proposed by the regulation make some definitions clearer; facilitate certain procedures; help avoid ‘clearing shocks’ and other disproportionate burdens to businesses; suggest the cancellation of the information threshold, given that the clearing threshold provides sufficient assurance; introduce coherent and transparent criteria for regulatory decisions, and clarify the procedures when classifying OTC derivatives and CCPs as eligible for clearing. While promoting the resilience and transparency of derivatives markets, the regulation also intends to maintain the efficiency of these markets for hedging by end-users, whether financial or non-financial. Maintaining the international nature of this market promotes both these objectives when underpinned by cooperation between supervisory authorities and convergent international standards.</p>

In 2008, there were calls – supported by a number of Members of the European Parliament – for an end to financial derivatives, particularly over-the-counter derivatives, which are nothing more than the instruments also at the root of the speculation on foodstuffs, inseparable from the savage instability in the prices of these goods in 2007 and 2008, leading to the food crises.

That is why the EU and the European Parliament hastened to satisfy their demand that the application of measures to protect the health of workers should be postponed indefinitely. This particular instance again proves the real purpose of the EU, as an imperialist union of the monopolies, in safeguarding their profitability and protecting their power. For the EU, the political spokesmen of capital in the European Parliament and the bourgeois governments of the Member States, protection for the health and life of workers represents a cost to capital and has no value whatsoever compared with the profits and the ‘competitiveness’ of companies, which are built on the blood and lives of the working class.

However, there was a strong campaign by manufacturers of magnetic resonance equipment and associations of radiologists to exclude the medical sector and magnetic resonance imaging scanners from the scope of the directive. It was alleged that magnetic resonance equipment could not comply with the ceilings provided for in the directive, meaning that patients would be deprived of the early detection of various diseases, such as cancer. In this context, in 2007, the Commission proposed extending the deadline for transposing the directive by four years. It is now making an identical proposal, thereby delaying the matter until 2014. Our group voted against putting back transposition until 2012 and our stance now is consistent with the stance we took back then.

In view of the very short period of time left before the deadline set for transposition of 30 April 2012, I firmly believe that it must be ensured that this directive is adopted by the European Parliament and the Council as a matter of urgency and that it enters into force without delay.</p>

      <p sl="it">Since the concerns expressed by the European Commission regarding the excessively low permissible levels of electromagnetic radiation from medical devices concur with the critical comments from the medical community and businesses based on the use of radiation-emitting machinery, I believe that we must support the new directive amending Directive 2004/40/EC and therefore postpone the latter’s entry into force, scheduled for April 2012. As regards the period of postponement, I believe that postponement to 2013 would be more sensible. The definition of clear limits for electromagnetic fields is, in fact, indispensable for business operations and the swift transposition of the directive will benefit not only those businesses but also workers and the medical community. For these reasons, I voted in favour.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of this directive, which seeks to reduce the proposed deadline for the transposition of Directive 2004/40/EC on minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields). Transposition should take place by 31 October 2013 instead of 30 April 2014, which was the date initially proposed. The aim is to limit as far as possible the short-term adverse health effects on workers exposed to electromagnetic fields during their work. No workers may be exposed to values exceeding these limits, which are based on health impact and biological considerations. These values are directly measurable and indicate thresholds above which employers must take one or more of the measures provided for in the directive.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Parliament, meeting in Brussels, has just approved an 18-month extension of the deadline for transposing the directive on the protection of workers exposed to electromagnetic fields. The transposition deadline was 30 April 2012. However, Parliament had been alerted by the medical community to the fact that the maximum exposure values set by the directive placed disproportionate limitations on the use and development of medical magnetic resonance applications (MR), so it therefore decided to extend the deadline in order to continue the consultations and take the most appropriate decision. The challenge will be to find a fair balance between the protection of workers and the effective monitoring of patients when diagnosing and treating diseases.</p>

      <p sl="fr">Parliament has drawn up two reports on the protection of workers exposed to electromagnetic fields. The first report relates to the revision of Directive 2004/40/EC, which lays down maximum values for the exposure of workers to electromagnetic fields. The second report, which we adopted today, relates to the postponement of the transposition deadline for that directive. The aim is to postpone the deadline from 30 April 2012 to 31 October 2013 so that the directive can be properly revised. The 2004 directive has not been transposed in all of the Member States because the maximum exposure values are disproportionate and would have placed excessive limitations on the use and development of medical magnetic resonance applications, such as MR. MR is considered to be a vital tool for the diagnosis and treatment of a number of diseases. The report by Elisabeth Morin-Chartier was adopted with 610 votes in favour and I am pleased about that. As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, I call on the Member States to give consideration to the impasse in which the medical community could find itself if MR technologies were not given an exemption from the exposure limit values recommended by the Commission in its proposal for a directive.</p>

In fact, in-depth analysis has shown that the technical complexity of the issue prevents an agreement from being reached that ensures a high level of protection for workers’ health and safety, without disproportionately limiting the pursuit and development of medical activities that use electromagnetic fields.

      <p sl="ro">This directive sets out minimum requirements, providing Member States with the opportunity to retain or adopt more favourable provisions for protecting workers, in particular, to set lower guideline values and limit values for exposure to electromagnetic fields. A system intended to provide protection against electromagnetic fields must be restricted to defining the objectives which must be achieved, the principles which must be observed and the fundamental values which need to be applied. Protecting workers exposed to electromagnetic fields requires an effective and efficient risk assessment to be carried out. This obligation must be commensurate with the situation encountered in the workplace. This makes it important to define a protection system establishing a progressive scale of risks which is easy to understand. Employers must adapt to technological progress and scientific knowledge regarding the risks from exposure to electromagnetic fields, with a view to offering workers better health and safety protection. In view of the scientific progress made and the increasingly widespread use in different areas of equipment generating electromagnetic fields with a clearly defined aim, which is also beneficial to society, I call on Member States to allocate the necessary funds for research into detecting as precisely as possible the adverse effects caused to the human body from exposure to electromagnetic fields.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The protection of workers from electromagnetic fields will, for a number of years, continue to be the missing link in terms of Europe’s safety standards in the workplace. An eight-year procedure has not sufficed to finalise an agreement between the European Parliament and the Council on this issue and complete the legal arsenal. Workers are already protected by three European directives: noise, optical radiation and mechanical vibration. I previously expressed my doubts in 2008 when the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (Anderson report) supported the European Commission’s strategy of putting this directive ‘on ice’, when I believed that it would make more sense to make minor amendments to it and provide for a derogation for medical magnetic resonance applications (MR). The Commission has provided for such a derogation in its new proposal, but it is not enough and the legal-institutional mess persists. It is, of course, regrettable that European workers are not yet protected by common safety standards in the area of electromagnetic fields. However, we should still welcome the ‘respite’ granted to the European MR sector, which is extremely important for a whole range of patients, who undergo more than 30 million medical exams involving MR every year in Europe.</p>

      <p sl="it">I support the report, as it is important to prescribe minimum health and safety requirements relating to the exposure of workers to risks from electromagnetic fields. The medical community has expressed its concerns regarding the entry into force of Directive 2004/40/EC, which prescribes permissible levels of exposure to electromagnetic radiation from medical devices, namely, that these limits are too low both for operators and for industries whose operations are based on the use of radiation-emitting machinery. The only point of dispute concerns the date for transposition of this directive, which was originally due to take effect in 2012, but which the European Commission wishes to ‘delay’ by two years. I believe that, for the sake of protecting workers and securing a healthy environment for them which complies with tolerance levels, in this case as regards radiation, it is important not to accede to the Commission’s request for a two-year deferment period to allow for an evaluation of the problems linked to levels that are considered too low, but to opt instead for one year only.</p>

In 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive replacing Directive 2004/40/EC. The purpose of the new directive is to provide a high level of protection for workers’ health and safety, while making it possible to continue and develop medical and industrial activities that use electromagnetic fields. Proposal COM(2011)0348 is intended to update and improve a considerable number of provisions in Directive 2004/40/EC, including by introducing mechanisms which make it easier for employers, especially small enterprises, to implement the measures. The amendment tabled by the Commission through COM(2012)0015 only affects the Member States’ obligation to transpose Directive 2004/40/EC by 30 April 2012, with the deadline being extended until 31 October 2013. The amendment does not affect the substance of the directive in question, thereby avoiding additional obligations being imposed on businesses. Extending the transposition deadline to 31 October 2013 will give Parliament and the Council sufficient time to have a debate and reach a compromise, based on Commission proposal COM(2011)0348 , on a new directive, which will update and enhance the provisions of Directive 2004/40/EC, while repealing and replacing the previous directive.</p>

They are indispensable in the fight against cancer and in diagnosing illnesses in children, who are particularly susceptible to harmful X-rays. I am pleased that Parliament has agreed to postpone the transposition of the directive until 2013. This will allow time for the introduction of new legislation which is fit for purpose. We need to protect workers from over-exposure to electromagnetic fields, while ensuring that patients across Europe receive the highest standard of care – including access to this important imaging technique.

These excise duties play an important role in trying to influence public behaviour and in contributing to the public budgets of Member States and the EU. The European Union has developed and gradually rolled out a new, state-of-the-art system for monitoring the movement of goods under suspension of excise within the internal market – the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). More importantly, the new system should allow the relevant authorities to track the goods’ movement in real time and compare information immediately, which will enable a more rapid and in-depth analysis of it. Much of the proposal concerns the legal rules covering how administrative cooperation should take place under the new system.

Now more than ever, economic operators are asking for quality of service and legal certainty. In this regard, the growing automation of the system will significantly reduce administrative burdens and streamline procedures. This must be supported by initiatives for regulatory alignment which seek to promote enhanced cooperation between Member States on VAT and direct taxation, and on fraud prevention and the fight against fraud, by means of automatic exchange protocols that allow for various, gradual options, to which the States are free to adhere. It is, however, important to highlight the lack of alternatives: Member States are unlikely to be able to create a network of bilateral agreements across Europe, capable of supporting a coherent system of information exchange and administrative cooperation. Distinguishing features of the framework proposed, which is supported by the report, are efficiency, rationalisation of resources, legal and operational coordination and increased legal certainty in tax matters: characteristic elements of an ordered and free civil framework.

      <p sl="el">The report tries to support administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties in order to address problems of fraud. The Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) is already up and running and the new regulation simply imposes a permanent obligation on the Member States and the Commission to ensure that it and related services are maintained. I abstained because, although controls over movements of products subject to excise duties are faster and more comprehensive using the automated system, which is a step towards combating tax fraud and tax evasion, I consider that they are not enough and do not resolve the problem of tax evasion and tax avoidance. Also, it is based on focusing Union policy on the socially unfair indirect taxes borne by citizens, at a time when direct taxes on all sources of wealth are being reduced. I therefore believe that the problem needs to be set on the right footing and a socially fair tax policy needs to be applied, which plays a development and redistributive role and can combat the serious problem of tax competition, of effective controls, of taxation of offshore companies and of the tax havens flourishing in the Union.</p>

The existence of different levels of excise duties creates cross-border problems for Member States and means extra work for customs authorities. Obviously, the ideal would be to have a fiscal union in Europe. Until that becomes possible, good administrative cooperation is vital in order to avoid evasion of these duties. I voted for this report and I hope that its implementation will contribute to improving the fight against fraud and tax evasion.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This proposal by the Commission is aimed at modernising the current common framework for administrative cooperation between the Member States in the field of excise duties. The regulation focuses on the importance of, and need for, administrative cooperation, in particular, in the case of cross-border irregularities, and is not aimed at harmonising national laws on the management of excise movements or the taxation of consumer goods, as both of these are covered by other legal acts. The Commission proposal properly addresses certain important aspects such as the simplification of certain bureaucratic procedures, while also rightly taking account of the fact that the handling of personal data should be the responsibility of each Member State. Unfortunately, the rapporteur is somehow seeking to undermine respect for national laws, competences and sovereignty in this field. We are therefore unhappy with Amendment 1 tabled by the rapporteur, which calls for the creation of a European fiscal union. Similarly, we also reject the unwarranted references to the internal market and the promotion thereof.</p>

      <p sl="sk">Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 of 16 November 2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties provides for a common system whereby, in order to ensure the correct application of excise legislation and, on the other hand, combat excise duty evasion and the ensuing distortions in the internal market, Member States assist each other and cooperate with the Commission. The completion of the internal market continues to require a system of administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties. The exchange of information in excise matters is necessary to a very wide extent in order to establish a true picture of the excise affairs of some persons. For the purposes of a proper coordination of information flows, it is necessary to maintain the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on a single point of contact in each Member State. Since more direct contacts between the authorities and officials may be needed to ensure efficiency, the provisions on delegation and the designation of competent officials should also be maintained. For the effective monitoring of procedures relating to excise in cross-border movement, it is also necessary to continue to provide for the possibility of simultaneous controls by Member States and for the presence of officials of one Member State in the territory of another Member State within the framework of administrative cooperation. I further believe that feedback is an appropriate means of ensuring continual improvement of the quality of the information exchanged. A framework for the provision of feedback should therefore be put in place.</p>

      <p sl="hu">I voted in favour of clarifying and enhancing the legal framework for administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties because I am convinced that it is not enough for Member States to simply be committed to information exchange, as without well-designed, automated and uniform information technology systems, data is exposed to loss and other risks. This law and the computerised control system (EMCS) it includes greatly contribute to the accomplishment of Member State economic goals because this harmonised data provision system allows for comparison and comprehensive analysis of excise duties based on a uniform methodology. Furthermore, it must be noted that the report mentions that information exchange can take place in any language, which, in addition to facilitating the fulfilment of Member State administrative obligations, also makes a definite contribution to diversity and equality between Member States. By submitting motions for amendment, I, too, contributed to the creation of a data provision system that does not impose further bureaucratic burdens on enterprises and Member States but promotes transparency and a smoother operation of the internal market in accordance with EU data protection regulations.</p>

The Commission proposes adopting a new regulation on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duty, which will replace the existing regulation. The aim is to align legislation in this field with the possibilities created by the development of the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) and to provide a more clearly defined legal base, allowing for the replacement of existing manual and semi-automated procedures. The scope of the regulation will be widened so that it covers administrative cooperation to ensure the enforcement of all excise legislation, not just the correct assessment of excise duties. A secondary aim is to more clearly define the rights and obligations of Member States and the Commission in this field, both within the scope of EMCS and more generally. The legislation leads to administrative simplification, as it comprises common measures, which are easy to interpret and apply. Public authorities will be able to use common tools and instruments in a pre-defined organisational framework. This set of measures will simplify recourse to European international administrative cooperation.</p>

Nevertheless, during the parliamentary process, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thought it right to include a clear reference to the creation of a European fiscal union in the text. This reference was, and is, completely inappropriate, since greater administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties is quite different to the significance, including in political terms, of a European fiscal union. I tabled an amendment to remove this reference, but unfortunately, the majority of this House voted against it.

      <p sl="pt">The 2013 budget is still a budget for a time of crisis, so it should employ rigorous budgetary management processes in order to make savings and set a good example to the other institutions and the Member States. In fact, the European public would not understand it if the EU did not show restraint and efficiency in managing its own resources, when they are being asked to make sacrifices in their countries. The public is therefore asking us to manage the resources allocated to us properly and to make savings whenever possible. Once again, I will vote for the request for a single seat for the European Parliament, a proposal which would lead to substantial savings and more effective management of both financial and human resources.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report, which was drafted by Mr Vaughan, examines the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2013 - Section I - Parliament. The economic crisis that is affecting most of the Member States requires us to exercise restraint in our own budget. I therefore welcome this proposal for a modest budget which has grown by only 1.9%, below the forecast rate of inflation, thus meeting the Commission’s request. The cuts that have been introduced seek not to jeopardise either the quality of services or the effectiveness of the work carried out by Members.

      <p sl="pt">This report on Parliament’s estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2013 focuses on the idea of making savings, in other words, on the reduction of the budget at various levels. However, it advocates cuts where cuts should not be made, and says nothing about areas that could and should be called into question. We therefore voted for the proposed amendments tabled by our group, which were aimed at clarifying some of these issues. We agree that it is important to reduce excessive and disproportionate spending by Parliament, but it is important to ensure that such ‘savings’ are not made at the expense of making workers redundant, job insecurity or principles such as multilingualism. The defence of this principle made in the report is, at the very least, hypocritical, as it ignores existing limitations and shortfalls and advocates cuts in the field of translation and interpretation. Moreover, as a result of its own parameters, which it adopts in other areas, the report is too soft when it comes to the financing of the European parties. We do not agree with this as a matter of principle. Furthermore, using the rhetoric of frugality, several areas of the report seek nothing more than to legitimise and justify the brutal, so-called ‘austerity’ measures which are being imposed by governments and by the EU.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The ceiling for heading 5 of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the EU budget in 2013 is EUR 9 181 million at current prices. I firmly believe that the goal of any budget negotiation should be to achieve maximum efficiency. In accordance with the agreement reached by the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets at the conciliation meeting of 13 March 2012, the overall level of the draft estimates for 2013 is set at EUR 1 759 391 671. At the same time, strict budgetary control, close cooperation with the Committee on Budgets and the identification of further possible savings during this budgetary procedure are needed. Taking note of the increased involvement of Members of Parliament in non-legislative work as laid down in the Rules of Procedure, which mobilises a considerable amount of Parliament’s resources and those of other EU institutions, it is necessary to analyse this fact and to present options on how to reduce this increased burden. I am of the opinion that further reorganisation of Parliament’s working methods should be considered; substantial savings could be achieved by establishing a single seat for Parliament. With regard to the conditions set out in the regulation concerning the financing of political parties, it is a cause for concern that the principles on which the EU is founded, namely, the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are not being fully respected. Parliament should provide funding only to those parties that rigorously uphold the founding principles of the EU and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

A number of positive measures have already been taken; I agree with the freeze in MEPs’ allowances and travel expenses. The House of European History represents a good idea which would inform citizens of the diverse range of perspectives on the history of Europe. However, we must ensure that expenditure is managed carefully, and that cost estimates are strictly adhered to. With regard to the amendment on the verification of office expenditure, the wording needs clarification. Evidently, MEPs should be able to provide the Bureau with proper justification for their expenses, but this needs to be done in a pragmatic and reasonable way. As a result of the Parliament’s ongoing drive to continuously improve the use of its finances, Parliament’s spending for 2013 should be more efficient and the small increase in its budget will be below the European rate of inflation. It is more than ever important that citizens believe that the EU is spending money on projects that ultimately provide value to citizens.</p>

Aware of certain budgetary constraints, we have evaluated the change in our funding requirements at + 1.9% in comparison with 2012, an increase below the level of inflation. Some budget lines will be subject to freezing in order to achieve this target, such as Members’ allowances, transport costs, etc. Other areas will also need to be studied closely in order to avoid any overspending: this is the case for costs relating to building maintenance or the establishment of the House of European History. Over the course of the year, we will also need to be more vigilant about some additional necessary loans, such as those relating to the accession of Croatia, which have still not been included in the budget’s provisions.

At a time when the global economic situation requires everyone to adopt austerity plans, the expenses involved in moving MEPs, assistants, translators, interpreters and officials, together with documents and technical equipment of all kinds, are completely unjustified. The economic waste stems from maintaining two practically identical seats which are both used by MEPs on a part-time basis. I am referring, in particular, to the seat in Strasbourg, which is kept active and operational so that it can be used just five days a month. In terms of the impact on the environment, in line with the importance that Parliament attaches to protecting the ecosystem while carrying out its activities, transporting all the equipment in lorries once a month from Brussels to Strasbourg and back to Brussels, and transferring thousands of people, undoubtedly produces CO2 emissions which Europeans could be spared.

As for the rest of the budget, Parliament’s priorities for 2013 may be summed up in several proposals to freeze various budget lines relating to administrative operation, but with a logic of rationalisation that could jeopardise the defence of multilingualism or funding for projects aimed particularly at raising citizens’ awareness of European history or issues relating to the European elections.</p>

      <p sl="de">Eurostat has forecast an inflation rate of 2.7% for this year, so that the European Parliament’s proposed budget for 2013 can be judged appropriate. However, it must be considered that the reduction in spending on maintenance measures, languages services or other services will have a negative effect on the substance, capacity for action and quality of Parliament’s work and infrastructures in the medium term and an excessive cap on investment should not be allowed to result in disproportionately higher costs at a later stage. The ‘single seat’ issue was clearly supported by an overwhelming majority (429 - 184, with 37 abstentions). This decision by the European Parliament points in the right direction, representing a saving of EUR 200 million. I have voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="en">At a time of austerity, we need to cut the bloated EU budget. As a Member of the European Parliament, I believe that this House should be the first to tighten its belt. The estimate for the cost of the European Parliament for 2013 is EUR 1.8 billion. This is a staggering amount which sticks in the craw of EU citizens, not least my London constituents. We need to make savings in the translation and interpretation services. We must do away with the costly ‘European House of History’ which is a boondoggle, a vanity project and an insult to every EU taxpayer. But the most obvious saving is staring us firmly in the face. We need to scrap the Strasbourg seat. We are wasting nearly half a billion euro each year shuttling backwards and forwards between Brussels and Strasbourg. This travelling circus is making a mockery of the European Parliament and it is time to bring down the curtain on this absurd waste of money.</p>

      <p sl="pl">We have completed our discussion of the European Parliament’s budget for 2013. Parliament’s expenditure is expected to be EUR 1.759 billion, which will mean a rise of 1.9% in comparison to 2012. By far the largest part of this expenditure is related to Parliament’s staff, of whom there are going to be 6 713 employees, and the maintenance of Parliament’s buildings in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg. In my opinion, there are ways of reducing this budget and of being more radical in the search for savings.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Firstly, the appropriate authorities of Parliament and the Council should cut the number of places where Parliament meets so that it has a single seat, not just for the Members of Parliament, but also for Parliament’s officials. The current situation generates additional costs of several hundred million annually, and this cannot continue.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Secondly, I cannot understand why, with the present scale of movement of parliamentarians and officials – tens of thousands of flights are made in any one year – Parliament is not able to negotiate reductions on air tickets with Europe’s largest carriers. We pay more for our tickets than tickets bought on an individual basis, using the Internet, for example. I think radical change is needed here.</p>

We reject cuts in the field of translation and interpretation, an area which is already seeing various shortfalls.

      <p sl="fr">EUR 1.6 million to help more than 1 000 Spanish workers to retrain and find a new job: aid has been granted at the last minute. The cause: workers made redundant as a result of the economic crisis. This just does not make sense. I shall explain what I mean by this: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established in 2006 to help towards the retraining of workers made redundant because of globalisation. Then the economic crisis hit and a derogation was introduced so that workers made redundant because of the crisis could also benefit from the fund; this derogation ended on 31 December 2011. In spite of Parliament’s vote to extend the derogation, the Council of Ministers decided against it. The result is that, although the effects of the economic crisis are, at times, still being felt very severely in the Member States, workers will be deprived of EGF support. From now on, this fund may only provide support for redundancies linked directly to globalisation. This is an aberration and a completely incomprehensible situation for our fellow citizens. The EGF will once again be under-used because of this pathetic decision taken by the ministers who represent us.</p>

There have been requests for the mobilisation of the EGF in cases of mass redundancies of workers across Europe due to the worsening of the crisis. We can therefore only regret the Council’s decision not to extend the crisis derogation, which increased the rate of EU cofinancing to 65%, beyond 31 December 2011. This means that the countries with the greatest economic and social difficulties – those where the most companies have gone bankrupt and where there is the most unemployment – are those that will least be able to make use of the EGF. We will continue to insist on the increase in EGF cofinancing, especially for countries that are in a fragile state financially, like Portugal, in order to ensure that the national contribution does not exceed 5% of the total financing planned.</p>

      <p sl="sv">I voted in favour of the report. The crisis in the construction sector in Spain is primarily a result of the failure of the euro and is only, to a very limited extent, to do with globalisation. The structure of the euro resulted in the same level of interest rates throughout the whole of the euro area. In Spain, as in Ireland, the interest rates should have been significantly higher in order to counteract the overheating in the economies of these countries. Instead, the level of interest rates set by the European Central Bank helped to create housing bubbles in both countries. The bubbles burst when the financial crisis struck. It created mass unemployment in both countries, and the construction sector has been particularly hard hit. Thus, the fundamental problem lies in the functioning of the euro and finance capitalism. However, I obviously believe that the workers affected must be given as much support as possible in order to alleviate their vulnerable situation. I have therefore voted in favour of this report.</p>

Spain’s application concerns 1 138 redundancies, all targeted for assistance, in 513 enterprises operating in the construction sector in the Valenciana region. One of the criteria for the Commission’s assessment was the evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis. In this respect, the Spanish authorities argue that the construction sector has been severely affected by the crisis. Loans to the construction sector and to individuals have been drastically reduced and the demand for new houses has decreased due to declining consumer confidence and the lack of cash. According to the Spanish authorities, the employment situation in the affected area seems particularly fragile, given the impact of the crisis on traditional sectors such as the textile sector, or on sectors related to construction, such as the ceramic sector and the stone cutting, shaping and finishing sectors, as these sectors are very important for the region’s economy.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the report on the application submitted by Spain to mobilise the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for the building construction sector in the Valencia region. The scope of the EGF was broadened from 1 May 2009 to include support for workers affected by the economic and financial crisis and to assist their reintegration into the labour market. The relevant application concerns 1 138 redundancies which were made in 513 enterprises in the building construction sector in the Valencia region of Spain, between July and November 2011. Spain highlighted the fact that unemployment in the region increased in 2010 by 12.2% compared to 2009, and by 309% compared to the pre-crisis year of 2007. In 2010, workers laid off in the construction sector accounted for 28.18% of all redundancies in the region, while in 2007, they only accounted for 6.3%. We call on the Commission and Member States to ensure a rapid, smooth procedure for adopting decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, with the aim of helping workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis. We call on the Commission and Member States to monitor the integration into the labour market of those benefiting from this application to mobilise the EGF.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report approves the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), with the aim of supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the economic and financial crisis – in this case, Spanish workers. It concerns the mobilisation of EUR 1 642 030 in order to provide assistance to more than 1 100 civil construction workers made redundant in more than 500 companies in Comunidad Valenciana. This type of request for the mobilisation of the EGF is ever more prevalent in cases of mass redundancies of workers across Europe, as policies have led to the worsening of the crisis. We can therefore only regret the Council’s decision not to extend the ‘crisis derogation’, which increased the rate of EU cofinancing to 65%, beyond 31 December 2011. This means that the countries with the greatest economic and social difficulties – those where the most companies have gone bankrupt and where there is the most unemployment – are those that will least be able to make use of the EGF. We will continue to advocate the increase in EGF cofinancing, especially for countries that are in a fragile state financially, like Portugal, in order to ensure that the national contribution does not exceed 5% of the total financing planned.</p>

As you know, Parliament had become a true colegislator in the EU as its powers were on a par with those of the Council of Ministers in the ordinary legislative procedure and in the budget procedure. We, your representatives, are now on a truly equal footing with the ministers representing the national governments. Including Council Question Time on the agenda every part-session is therefore no longer legitimate. At the same time, however, as the report highlights, the Lisbon Treaty ‘created new institutions alongside governments: the European Council and its permanent President, the High Representative and the Eurogroup’. In my view, it is therefore appropriate not only that question hours with the Council of Ministers and with the President of the Commission should continue to be an option, but also that a process of this kind should be provided for with the President of the European Council, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Eurogroup.</p>

In view of the recent development in interinstitutional relations, I believe that it is imperative for the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure to be revised. However, I, too, support the view of the rapporteur, which is that the priority at the moment should be to amend Council Question Time.

In reality, it still has to fight to see that the rules are applied: sometimes, it seems as though the Member States have not read the Lisbon Treaty. The links between the institutions have been strengthened and it is essential to enhance Parliament’s power of appeal with regard to the Council: we must retain the option of putting questions to the Council –during a specific question hour – on matters relating to responsibilities other than those linked to the exercise of its legislative and budgetary functions. Question hours not only with the President of the Commission, but also with the Vice-President/High Representative and with the President of the Eurogroup should continue to be an option, particularly in the context of the crisis in which these new institutions have been called on to take major political decisions. This contact is essential if Parliament is to take its full place in the balance of power between the institutions and be a central element in public debate and in legitimising the EU with regard to the citizens.</p>

I voted in favour of this report because I agree with the rapporteur in the sense that, despite the Council and Parliament exercising their legislative and budgetary functions on an equal footing, Question Time to the Council must be kept because, according to the second sentence of Article 16(1) of the Treaty on European Union, the Council has policy-making and coordinating powers on which it must keep Parliament informed.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The end of Question Time with the Council (which has already happened in practice), as it was conceived, is a result of the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. What is now being proposed is the creation of a new specific question hour on matters relating to responsibilities other than those linked to the exercise of its budgetary and legislative functions. The institutional changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, which are frequently praised for strengthening Parliament’s powers, have, in fact, resulted in a weakening of the national parliaments and legislative power structures that are closer to the people and over which they have better control. The national parliaments have, in fact, been relegated to the secondary role of prior supervision of the subsidiarity principle in the European law-making process. The Portuguese Parliament has lost the power to make its own decisions in fundamental areas, and only its participation as an advisory body has increased, but without the right to veto EU decisions with which it disagrees. It is only in highly theoretical and exceptional cases (which have never actually occurred), and only in conjunction with other national parliaments, that it is able to make matters somewhat difficult for the Commission by delaying the legislative process.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The Treaty of Lisbon has established a new balance between the institutions. This balance is based, among other things, on the principle that Parliament and the Council carry out their legislative and budgetary functions on an equal footing. The logical consequence of such an arrangement is the need to adapt Parliament’s Rules of Procedure to the Treaties. There is no doubt about the need to end Parliament’s current right to put questions to the Council which relate to these functions, since in these areas, the two institutions have equal powers and work in close cooperation. The procedure of successive readings and tabling amendments is a de facto mechanism that replaces and strengthens the system of questions which keep a check on the Council. Continued operation of these rules would be an unnecessary duplication of legislative institutions.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposed amendment of the Rules of Procedure also provides for Parliament to retain its powers to put specific questions to the Council on the Council’s policy-making and coordinating functions. This is the right solution. It protects Parliament from the Council having too much freedom in this area. It strengthens the democratic supervision of the Council by an institution which is an expression of the will of the EU’s citizens.

Following the Committee’s debate on the working document on 27 November 2011, when the working document was submitted to the Committee, it was shown how abolishing Council Question Time would reflect the shift in the institutional balance.

In addition to that, an EU-Belarus diplomatic conflict escalated after the Belarusian authorities requested that the EU ambassador and the Polish ambassador leave the country, and recalled their own ambassadors from Brussels and Warsaw. In view of these last events, I support the decision to withdraw all EU ambassadors from Belarus and I believe that a firm commitment by all EU Member States to act in a united manner can promote universal values in Belarus and bring the country closer to the path of democratic transition.

These are unquestionable values throughout the EU and a commitment to safeguard them must underlie the signing of any treaty or cooperation agreement between the EU and third countries. Although Belarus is geographically close to EU territory, politically, it is far removed; not even the December 2010 presidential elections could accelerate the country’s democratisation process. Abolition of the death penalty is therefore urgent, as is the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners detained in inhumane conditions and subjected to torture. Despite agreeing that the EU should maintain good neighbourly relations with Belarus, I voted for this joint motion for a resolution, pursuant to Rule 110(4) of the Rules of Procedure, since previous resolutions have not achieved the desired effect and it is imperative that the Minsk government make progress towards the democratisation of the country with complete compliance with human rights and the rule of law.</p>

This interference occurs both through political and financial support for the opposition, independent media, Belarusian civil society and NGOs, and through greater cooperation with its eastern neighbours, with the shared aim of launching a genuine democratic process in Belarus. For our part, we hold the defence of peoples’ independence and sovereignty as a fundamental principle, and it is up to each people to define the political, economic and social system which best serves its interests and aspirations on both an individual and a collective level.</p>

      <p sl="sk">On 23 January 2012, the Council of the European Union adopted a decision broadening the criteria for applying sanctions to Belarusian individuals and entities involved in serious human rights violations and repressions, or who are benefiting from the Belarusian regime. Large numbers of representatives of the Belarusian democratic opposition and civil society activists, including former presidential candidates and prominent human rights defenders, remain in prison on political grounds. The European Parliament continues to strongly condemn the deteriorating situation in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms combined with the lack of deep democratic and economic reforms in Belarus. At the same time, it calls for the immediate and unconditional release and rehabilitation of all political prisoners in the country. I am of the opinion that it is imperative that Belarus takes steps showing its goodwill and allowing the re-establishment of normal diplomatic relations between Belarus and the EU and its Member States. The EU is determined to strengthen its engagement with Belarusian civil society and to support the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people. The gradual re-engagement of the EU with Belarus and the renewal of the political dialogue with the official representatives of Minsk for the benefit of the citizens of Belarus will be possible if Belarus shows its willingness to take steps towards the adoption of all international standards of democracy, human rights, civil liberties and the principles of the rule of law.</p>

      <p sl="en">This is not the first time we have discussed human rights violations in Belarus. The repressive measures imposed by President Lukashenko’s government on the people of Belarus were the subject of the last five resolutions we adopted on the country. Last month, we debated the trial and verdict of Mr Dmitry Konovalov and Mr Vladislav Kovalev, two men who were dubiously found guilty in the terrorist attacks of 2005 in Vitebsk, and 2008 and 2010 bomb attacks in Minsk. These men are two victims of the oppressive regime, but sadly not the only ones. Belarus is today the only country in Europe that still carries out the death penalty. Its active prosecution of political opposition, civil society, the media and human rights defenders further contributes to the country’s isolation. We prefer diplomacy over sanctions; thus, the EU is ready to use the assistance and cooperation tools available to negotiate with Belarus. But we are also ready to maintain sanctions imposed on Belarusian officials and on companies that directly finance the regime, and further extend them if our calls remain unanswered. The current resolution confirms our commitment to the Belarusian people, as well as our affirmative approach towards the government. Therefore, I voted in support of it.</p>

The European Union has called on several occasions for the release of political prisoners, but the Minsk regime, strengthened by its close economic ties with Russia, has decided to take a harder line towards the EU by expelling the ambassador of Poland and the Head of the EU Delegation. This resolution will not bring about significant changes immediately, but it is important that Parliament should show its solidarity with the restrictive measures taken by the Council (asset freezes, travel bans, embargos on arms and material used for repression) and express, on behalf of the European citizens, its indignation towards a regime that violates the most essential rights and freedoms.</p>

Of course it is true that the situation in relation to human rights is, unfortunately, less than ideal. The European Union has committed itself to maintaining human rights. The way in which the opposition and its leaders have been treated is, of course, to be condemned. Nonetheless, the EU is once again playing the moral card with one country, while forgetting to do the same with others. The EU is using the same arguments as the US, demanding, among other things, the abandonment of the Ice Hockey World Championships, forgetting however that the US itself is very picky about which international laws it chooses to observe. Breaches of human rights in other countries, such as Turkey, are simply noted, if any attention is paid at all. In the case of Belarus, strict measures are immediately demanded that threaten the much-vaunted good neighbourly relations with Belarus and Russia.

Lukashenko does not behave like a head of state, but like a boss who regards Belarus as his own yard where he does what he wants. Belarusians are not sows and boars on a collective farm but proud people who want to live with dignity in an independent, prosperous European country. I want to stress that faced with such a situation, we need to continue EU support for the Belarusian forge of free thought in exile – the European Humanities University in Vilnius.

      <p sl="it">The political situation in Belarus has been seriously deteriorating since the last presidential elections. Repressive measures have been taken against the democratic opposition, free media, civil society activists and human rights defenders. The European Union, which has an obligation to maintain good neighbourly relations, must do its utmost to support, with financial and political means, the efforts of Belarusian civil society, independent media and non-governmental organisations in Belarus to promote democracy. Finally, this vote stresses the need for increased cooperation between the EU and its eastern neighbours in the framework of the Eastern Partnership with the aim of initiating a genuine process of democratisation in Belarus.</p>

      <p sl="pt">EU-Belarus diplomatic relations continue to deteriorate day by day, as the Belarus authorities insist on taking anti-democratic measures and actions, namely, the persecution of members of the opposition, journalists, civil society activists and defenders of human rights, and closing down media. At the same time, the declaration by the Belarus authorities that the EU and Polish ambassadors are personae non gratae has led to a total deadlock in bilateral relations. There will only be dialogue once Belarus takes the necessary measures to genuinely implement the rule of law, on the basis of respect for human rights and the freeing of political prisoners, opponents of the current government.</p>

Belarus has illegally detained any opponents or artists who criticised the work of the government. This cannot be borne by the EU and the international institutions. The EP urges that solutions be found to free the political victims of persecution imprisoned in Belarusian jails without a fair trial. It also stresses the importance of obliging this country to respect human rights and different kinds of freedoms. Even if the joint motion aims to improve EU-Belarus relations, the EP cannot allow Belarus to host the next World Ice Hockey Championship until it installs a democratic government. As Belarus is of crucial importance for the EU, being a neighbouring country, I voted in favour of this motion.</p>

Belarus is further slipping into the mire of repression and brutality and the EU must not allow there to be a dictator on its doorstep. I welcome this resolution and I welcome the recent extension of restrictive measures against those Belarusian officials who are subjugating civil society. However, if sanctions are to work, they must be followed to the letter. In January, the Belarusian Minister of Internal Affairs was able to visit Interpol in Lyon despite being on the list of officials banned from entering the EU. This is a flagrant disregard of the ban, and we must ensure it does not happen again. Also, we must look carefully into EU aid to Belarus. While I appreciate the work that is done by EU projects supporting civil society, around EUR 250 000 is going to swell the coffers of local authorities loyal to the Lukashenko regime. I call on the Commission to suspend all funding to Belarus under the ‘Local Authorities in Development’ budget line and to deliver this funding instead to human rights defenders and civil society organisations promoting democracy.</p>

From the start, the international community had serious doubts over the conduct of the investigation and the subsequent judgment. Even many of the injured and relatives of the victims remain unconvinced to this day that these two young people were the real perpetrators. Tens of thousands of Belarusians have signed a petition demanding that the death penalty not be carried out. I am pleased that this Parliament sees the Belarusian dictator Lukashenko for what he is.

      <p sl="pt">The majority of the EU shows creativity extending even to a sort of fantasy in the way it drafts its recurrent resolutions on Belarus. This time, not even the 2014 World Ice Hockey Championship has escaped its hypocritical wrath. This text is a repetition of the EU handbook on interference, with the aim of trying to extend the Union’s sphere of influence up to Russia’s borders. Despite our differences with the Minsk authorities, we do not share the point of view of the majority in Parliament, which not only does not recognise the sovereignty of the Belarusian people in defining their political power and their social, economic and cultural situation, but also supports direct interference in its internal affairs, violating a basic principle of international law. This interference occurs both through political and financial support for the opposition, independent media, Belarusian civil society and non-governmental organisations, and through greater cooperation with its eastern neighbours. For our part, we hold the defence of peoples’ independence and sovereignty as a fundamental principle, and it is up to each people to define the political, economic and social system which best serves its interests and aspirations on both an individual and a collective level.</p>

      <p sl="pl">There can be no talk of progress in dialogue between the EU and Belarus if Minsk does not make progress in the area of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, nor until it grants the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The worsening situation in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Belarus must change. Unfortunately, despite our geographical closeness, the European Union and Belarus are separated in many areas by a gulf of political and social standards. The persecution of human rights defenders and members of the democratic opposition and the politically motivated harassment of civil society activists and independent media in Belarus show us that cooperation is impossible, despite our most sincere desire to achieve this. How can we cooperate with someone who simply does not want that cooperation?</p>
      <p sl="pl">Today’s resolution is a democratic and peaceful means of expressing our opinion, because it is very important to stress clearly our disapproval of all actions which strike at fundamental freedoms.

These are people who have decided to dedicate their lives to the service of others, a long way from home.

      <p sl="el">The European Endowment for Democracy (EED) represents an unprecedented escalation in the EU war against grassroots and anti-imperialist movements and movements fighting to overturn the power of the monopolies. It is a most vulgar and reactionary plan, as the objective of the EED is to secretly finance EU agents, anti-revolutionary parties and organisations and various services, so that they can act when movements and grassroots uprisings start to gain ground, especially at times of major upheavals, along the same lines as the notorious US Endowment. The objective of the EU and of the bourgeois governments of the Member States is to manipulate movements, so that they can establish ‘new’ political forces, parties and leaders which are totally subjugated to the EU and the interests that it serves. The EED is being established in order to guarantee support and financing for a large group of ‘beneficiaries’: all sorts of agents, parties and organisations connected with the EU and the governments of the Member States, secret services and security services and NGOs that act as the long arm of imperialism; in other words, the entire mob of imperialist agents. The EED has nothing to do with democracy or grassroots freedoms; it is being established precisely in order to restrict and strike at them. It is an instrument for imposing the dictatorship of the monopolies, for undermining and manipulating grassroots movements, and for imposing imperialist sovereignty.</p>

On 7 July 2011, the European Parliament welcomed the initiative of establishing the European Endowment for Democracy, as did subsequently the Foreign Affairs Council. I agree with this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation, and I urge the Council to outline the methods for its creation.

With this in mind, it is appropriate to focus on strengthening the foundations of the society where democracy is in the process of being established. However, clear, transparent procedures are needed, including for the method of selecting beneficiaries. A simpler funding process and flexibility are also required, especially with regard to the opportunities for rapidly reprogramming funds. I should mention how important it is for the European Parliament to be sufficiently involved in the running of the European Endowment for Democracy (EED). I should point out that the results of the EED will need to be monitored and analysed closely to ensure that it provides maximum efficiency. I should mention that in implementing the EED, balanced support needs to be given to the processes for establishing democracy both in the Eastern Partnership and in the Southern Neighbourhood, in accordance with the ‘more for more’ principle.</p>

The intention is to set up a semi-autonomous entity which could support democracy activists and democratic developments around the world. Creating this new fund is a more suitable and effective method than reforming the existing instruments, particularly the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. It must be guaranteed that the EED plays a synergetic and complementary role relative to the work carried about by the EU institutions, including Parliament, and the Member States, their agencies and the foundations they fund.

In my view, any new initiative or body for the development of democracy must have a distinct added value to existing EU instruments and organisations, above all, in order to avoid duplication and overlapping between the EU’s democracy-building instruments and efforts. While acknowledging that the striving for democracy is expressly stated as a core principle of the EU's external action, I am concerned that several developing countries are currently experiencing a period of development only in economic terms, without freedom or democracy for their citizens.

Experience shows that the involvement of Parliament has contributed to the success of similar projects, so it is a good idea for MEPs to serve on the fund’s Board of Governors.

The EED will be further evidence that the European Parliament stands shoulder-to-shoulder with those fighting for democratic change, and for the promotion of equal rights for men and women in every country of the world. I voted for this motion for a resolution for the above reasons.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted against the report on the establishment of a European Endowment for Democracy because this is an effort to create yet another intervention mechanism to promote the interests of the European Union. Its basic objective will be to give the EU ways of supporting political parties, civil society and activists campaigning for democracy in countries under autocratic regimes or in a process of transition. In my opinion, and in the opinion of the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, this is a mechanism designed to directly influence political developments in third countries, but for the benefit of interests alien to the real interests of the people. Furthermore, this mechanism will be used not only by the EU and the Member States, but also by private operators and other States. This will reduce the influence and any democratic control of it by the Union and, more importantly, by the European Parliament.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The popular demonstrations of 2010 and 2011 against totalitarian regimes on the southern shore of the Mediterranean have become known as the ‘Arab Spring’. Thanks to these uprisings, many peoples have won their freedom and started a process of transition to democracy. This report by Mr Lambsdorff concerns a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the modalities for the possible establishment of a European Endowment for Democracy. This idea has come out of the extended debate on European Union actions promoting democracy worldwide and intends to create a semi-autonomous body ‘which could support democracy activists and democratic developments around the world in an unbureaucratic way and which would not be directly associated with EU diplomacy or the European Commission’. I voted for this report and welcome the adoption of the proposal to create a ‘European Endowment for Democracy’. It is an initiative supported by the EU High Representative and Commission Vice-President, Lady Ashton, and Commissioner Füle, and was considered a priority by the Polish Presidency of the Council.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The objective of the instrument proposed in this report is clear: to create better conditions for interfering in the domestic affairs of sovereign countries, so as to better serve the interests of the major EU powers, along with those of the big business and financial sectors thereof. In fact, it is clear – and very significant – how similar this instrument is to an existing one in the US with identical goals. They are lining up new interventions; new breaches of international law and the UN Charter, to add to the many other violations of instruments that the EU hypocritically claims to respect. They want to use this instrument to overcome the ‘lack of resources’, the ‘restricted mandate’, the ‘limitations and the lack of flexibility for promoting ‘change’ of the so-called European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. In the end, what ‘change’ do they want to promote: that which took place in Libya, in Afghanistan, in Iraq or in Honduras? What kind of democracy can be promoted by an EU that is itself attacking democracy within its borders; that wants to enshrine the ‘golden rule’ of neoliberalism in constitutions, whilst attacking the historic and civil rights and achievements of the workers and peoples?</p>

      <p sl="sk">The idea of a European Endowment for Democracy has been incorporated into the more general EU debate on the review of the EU’s policies and actions promoting democracy, following the events in the southern Mediterranean. The intention is to set up a semi-autonomous entity that could support democracy activists and the development of democracy around the world in an unbureaucratic way and that would not be directly associated with the EU diplomatic service or the European Commission. The European Endowment for Democracy was one of the priorities of the Polish Council Presidency, and it has worked with all stakeholders to advance the idea. Parliament should now be the institution that makes a constructive contribution to the debate, and it will also be involved in the establishment, the management structures and the scrutiny of this possible European fund. I firmly believe that it is important to consider that the European Union needs a more flexible and less bureaucratic instrument to assist political actors striving for democratic change in their countries. At the same time, it also seems reasonable to envisage the establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy as a non-profit, grant-making organisation created to strengthen democratic institutions around the world, since striving for democracy worldwide is not only a moral imperative, but is clearly stated as a core principle for the EU’s external action.</p>

      <p sl="pl">The European Endowment for Democracy (EED) will be a key institution enabling Europe to make a contribution to the democratisation of authoritarian states, both in the EU’s immediate neighbourhood and throughout the world. The report which has been adopted today gives the rapporteur, Mr Lambsdorff – and I would like to offer him my sincere compliments – a strong negotiating mandate in the work of the European External Action Service’s EED Working Group.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The EED should be a fund which works in close cooperation with, but remaining independent of, the European Union. The EED should be built on expert knowledge, allowing its reactions to be fast and flexible. The fund’s purpose will be to build civil society and the political potential of the democratic opposition before and during transformation from authoritarianism to democracy. The EED should therefore also support non-registered opposition groups because it is these groups which usually are not recognised and are opposed by undemocratic states. The lack of such an instrument was exposed by the events of the Arab Spring, for example, when it became apparent that the only strong opposition political players in the countries of the region were religious groups. As for our Eastern neighbours, significant assistance is needed by the opposition in Belarus, for example.</p>
      <p sl="pl">I would like to remind everyone that the EED was proposed by the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The idea to establish the EED is based on Poland’s experience of democratic transformation. Financial assistance from the West enabled Poland’s Solidarity movement and other opposition groups – which were not recognised by the Communist regime and officially did not exist – to develop and to fight for democratic change. We now ought also to give a similar opportunity to others.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The European Union plans to provide itself with a new tool dedicated to supporting all actions in favour of democracy and the rule of law led by civil society and its representatives in the neighbouring countries of the European Union. The proposal to set up a European Endowment for Democracy was launched following the events in the Southern Mediterranean in order to provide a more targeted response that did not duplicate the objectives of other existing European instruments and programmes, such as the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). This endowment, which is a response to the necessary adaptation of the EU to new issues arising from the Arab Spring, should go hand in hand with efforts towards democratic transition by providing concrete support to the actors involved in strengthening the values of democracy and the rule of law such as NGOs, the media, trade unions, bloggers, and so on.

In this regard, I believe that establishment of the European Endowment for Democracy could be one of the most tangible responses by the European Union to the challenges of democratisation in our neighbourhood. The Arab Spring showed Europe the great aspirations towards democracy of the Mediterranean populations, as well as the urgency of addressing the instability generated by undemocratic regimes in the EU’s neighbourhood. In particular, the events we have witnessed have been surprising for the role played by civil society and the power of popular protest. For this reason, I am very much in favour of the bottom-up approach that will guarantee direct support to civil society. However, this instrument will only be able to operate effectively if clear and transparent rules are adopted for the distribution of funds, inspired by an across-the-board involvement of civil society and pluralistic support for parties and associations.</p>

Parliament has asked the Council to ensure that the EED pays special attention to the participation of women in the democratic reform process, by supporting women’s organisations and projects in areas such as combating violence, generating employment and political participation, extending equal access to justice and education for women and girls, and preventing or ending existing violations of women’s rights.</p>

      <p sl="el">It is a fact that the European Union is fundamentally committed to promoting democracy in third countries. As the EU provides the most humanitarian and development aid in the world, it can use it to exert pressure on countries which are in clear breach of international conventions on human rights and democratic institutions.

I fully support the promotion of projects targeted in this way, but I believe that the use of the term ‘gender-sensitive areas’ in this context is misleading and confusing. We are talking about women and men, about Europe wanting to promote equal civil rights for women and men. The European Foundation for Democracy must avoid the temptation of exporting leftist ideological constructs of the ‘gender’ type to third countries because this would jeopardise its impartiality and credibility in the eyes of the partner countries.</p>

They want to use this instrument to overcome the ‘lack of resources’, the ‘restricted mandate’, the limitations and the lack of flexibility for promoting ‘change’ of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. What ‘change’ do the majority in Parliament want to promote in third countries when they are supporting one of the most violent attacks on democracy and human rights in EU countries like Portugal? What ‘change’ can we expect when they are really seeking to weaken popular resistance, and to discredit and weaken democracy, so as to gain support for authoritarian solutions? What kind of democracy can be promoted by an EU that wants to enshrine the ‘golden rule’ of neoliberalism in constitutions, whilst attacking the rights and achievements of the workers and peoples, and public health care, education and transport systems?</p>

The European Parliament welcomes the fact that Serbian citizens have had the opportunity to travel to the Schengen area without visas since December 2009, as strongly advocated by Parliament. Furthermore, it fully supports this extension of the visa-free regime, but is concerned about the increased numbers of asylum seekers in some EU Member States. The European Parliament welcomes the progress made in improving child protection and establishing a solid legal basis and strategies for increasing respect for children’s rights and reforming the child welfare system. It is, however, concerned about the slow pace of implementation of the legislation adopted, especially concerning children with disabilities, many of whom remain effectively excluded from society.

Turkey’s long road towards something closer to the democratic rule of law is a clear example of this. However, I believe we have to take into account the times in which we live. While the crisis continues and we have not solved our institutional problems with more streamlined decision making, enhanced economic governance and a true citizens’ Europe, continuing down the path of enlargement does not seem prudent to me.

I would reiterate the call to the Serbian Government to ensure that their direct relations with the authorities of the Republika Srpska are in line with this stated support and do not undermine the integrity, sovereignty, competences and effective functioning of the institutions of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbia should support political initiatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina that are aimed at reforming and strengthening the country’s institutions and encourage all its political leaders to reach a consensus on strengthening state-level institutions.

Serbia is definitely paying for the wrong decisions it made in the past, but it should be welcomed that it has assumed its responsibility for the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia and is taking action to make amends for its misdeeds. I would like to dwell on the progress made by Serbia in terms of its treatment of ethnic minorities. There is a great deal to be done on this, including with regard to the Vlach minority, which was recently the subject of a disagreement between Romania and Serbia. I believe that Belgrade must realise that one of its advantages lies in the existence of this ethnic diversity, which allows it to have better relations with its neighbours, if it uses it wisely. Identity crises and inter-ethnic conflicts have caused a great deal of harm in the Balkans region in the past. Serbia has a great deal to do to meet European standards in terms of rule of law and civil rights and liberties. The desire shown by Serbia’s leaders to carry out the necessary reforms bodes well. The EU and its Member States are waiting for action, the fulfilment of the commitments made and tangible progress in the areas subject to monitoring.</p>

      <p sl="hu">As a committed partner of Serbia, Hungary continues to support the country’s European integration. I believe that the Balkans and the surrounding region are of key importance to the European Union, and have particular relevance to Hungary. Of the former Yugoslav countries, Slovenia is already an EU Member State, Croatia’s accession has already been decided, and Macedonia and Montenegro are both official candidate countries. Throughout its term as President of the European Council, Hungary laboured towards the European integration of the Western Balkans, and its commitment to this goal remains unchanged. We therefore found it important to support the granting of candidate status to Serbia. It is important to stress, however, that the country must meet all requirements set by the EU, as the transposition of European law is essential for the resolution of the country’s long-standing problems.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Hungary has several historic ties to Serbia and, in particular, to its northern region of Vojvodina. It is in the interest of our neighbourhood policy, national policy, as well as the Hungarian population of Vojvodina, that the country join the community of EU Member States as soon as possible. I welcome the agreement concluded between the Serbian Government and the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMSZ), which allows for the implementation of the act on restitution and compensation. The goal remains to create a completely clear legal situation which rules out any form of enforcement of collective guilt.</p>
      <p sl="hu">It is welcome that Belgrade is undertaking major efforts to settle relations between Serbia and Kosovo and that both parties favour a peaceful resolution.

I would reiterate that Serbia’s path since the end of the former Yugoslavia after Soviet power collapsed has been particularly hard and violent, and that the tensions that persist in the region – most importantly, Kosovo – still have great potential for destabilisation. I would restate my hope that Serbia will persist with the European option, and I must congratulate its people and their leaders on the progress that they have made in this regard.

We all remember the conflicts in the Balkans, so all efforts to consolidate peace and encourage these countries’ economic development are to be welcomed. On 1 March, the Council awarded Serbia the status of candidate country. This distinction gives it greater responsibility for implementing the reforms enshrined in the Treaty of Copenhagen; specifically, making changes to the legal system, combating xenophobia and organised crime, and respecting minorities’ rights. Serbia is a country central to the Balkans, whose example of democratisation and struggle against corruption could and should set an example for neighbouring countries.

The great powers of NATO and the EU have used aggression and military occupation to create and impose a protectorate, and they want to oblige the Serbian people to accept this violation of their territorial integrity and sovereignty. The process of Serbia’s accession to the EU is inseparable from the historical process that included the destruction of Yugoslavia. The sowing of ethnic divisions, the aggression and the support for the destruction of this country are inseparable from the goal of economically dominating its successor states. This resolution also seeks to hold Serbia responsible for the legitimate protests that recently took place in Kosovo, attempting to mask the responsibilities of the EU itself and of NATO for the territory’s deteriorating economic and social situation, which is caused, above all, by its continued occupation.</p>

Also pleasing is the significant progress made by Serbia towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria; further movement in the European integration process depends on continued progress in this area and, in particular, on guaranteeing democracy, the functioning of democratic institutions, the rule of law, respect for human rights, the protection of minorities, maintaining good neighbourly relations, and regional cooperation, including the peaceful resolution of bilateral issues, as well as improving the functioning of the market economy. On the other hand, the situation in northern Kosovo is a cause for concern, especially in the second half of 2011, which resulted in violence as a consequence of the July incidents and subsequent attacks on the KFOR international forces. Such actions deserve condemnation, and the Serbian government should strive to meet its commitment of doing everything in its power to prevent them.

      <p sl="hu">What is truly at stake with Serbia’s EU accession is the measurement and appropriate utilisation of regional effects. The regional approach is also justified by the fact that in 2003, the EU promised membership to all countries in the Western Balkans. Today, however, the majority of these countries are not in a state to allow for the commencement of fulfilling this promise. Diversity in levels of development is a phenomenon known in Serbia as well. This assortment of problems is complemented by the uncertain outcome of the political process of internal consolidation in Balkan countries, which preserves, and even increases inherited differences. In my view, the Hungarians of Vojvodina have, on several occasions, demonstrated their commitment to EU accession. I am pleased that Serbia has been granted candidate status, but there is, of course, the bitter aftertaste of having had to wait far too long for this. Another sad fact is that over the past few months, the number of EU accession supporters in Serbia has dwindled to below 50%, and that the rise of apathy is, in part, due to news from individual EU Member States.</p>
      <p sl="hu">Of note is the fact that the Hungarian community of Vojvodina has keenly followed and is still following the events surrounding Hungary. This, too, has significantly overshadowed their eager anticipation of EU accession. In respect of Hungary’s internal policy dilemmas, the vast majority of the Vojvodina Hungarian community has, since the beginning, been on the side of the Hungarian Government. I am hopeful that these problems will be settled soon, thereby restoring the EU’s credibility and increasing its acceptance.</p>

It is common knowledge that Greece has been in favour of the accession of all the countries in the Western Balkans, especially Serbia, from the outset, provided that all the Copenhagen criteria are met. After years of reform and painful internal changes, the country’s efforts have finally been recognised and the door has been opened to Serbia’s European prospects; it would therefore have been unfair to vote against the report for that reason alone. Historically, Greece has been a strong supporter of this country’s European ambitions and it still is. To vote otherwise would have been to condemn those European prospects. However, we consider it absolutely unacceptable that the term ‘Macedonia’ has now been used for the first time in an official text adopted by a European body, in breach of UN resolutions and basic decisions adopted by the European Council. We would note that the S&amp;D Group fully supported the amendment tabled by Maria Eleni Koppa to remove the term ‘Macedonia’.</p>

      <p sl="en">I voted in favour of the resolution in order to acknowledge Serbia’s progress towards European integration and highlight the remaining goals to be achieved for the benefit of its people. However, further efforts are needed in judiciary reform. The publication of all judgments and the unification of jurisprudence should be priorities in order to ensure public trust and a predictable and efficient judicial system. On the fight against corruption, Serbian authorities must focus on high-level corruption cases. This is the test of the judiciary and of the political class. Serbia needs to show a strong track record of final convictions in high-level political cases. The efficiency of the EU funds spent on justice reform and combating corruption must also be assessed. The consistency of the rule of law throughout a nation is vital to its ability to progress politically and democratically.</p>

The mood of crisis in the European Union and the fear that further coercion is to be expected in relation to the Kosovo question, mean that the Serbs are less than enthusiastic about their country’s status as a candidate for accession. In relation to Kosovo, the EU must finally take seriously the fears among Kosovar Serbs that they will be driven into the ground by the overwhelming Albanian majority population. Serbia is not just a thoroughly European state in cultural, historical and geographical terms; it has also shown over the last year that it is willing and able gradually to fulfil the criteria demanded by the EU. I therefore voted in favour of the report. There is no doubt that the journey to full membership of the EU will be long and hard.

Serbia has to understand that having received EU candidate status, it cannot take it for granted, and that implementation of the commitments rather than promises will matter. The EU integration process is based on real progress and there will be no free gifts for any candidate country. The communist heritage must be faced. It lies at the root of many current socio-economic problems. It must be dealt with to allow true reconciliation within society and among the countries in the region. In regard to those cases where Serbia’s positions in different international fora challenge EU common positions and, furthermore, may be regarded as directed against individual EU Member States, I call on the Commission and the EEAS to send a clear message to the candidate country that the EU perspective will depend strongly on its alignment with EU positions and respect for the same values in international politics.</p>

For example, the government respects the prerogatives of the various minority councils and ensures their proper functioning. I therefore voted in favour of a resolution which calls on the Council to open accession negotiations with Serbia as soon as possible.

I believe that new possibilities for the dialogue and for solving the issues relating to Kosovo will emerge after the elections in Serbia on 6 May. In this regard, I would like to invite the European Commission to supply election observers to send to the polling stations during voting in order to monitor the situation closely. I am pleased with the recent attempt to amend the laws on elections, including local elections, and, in particular, the abolition of the undemocratic practices of appointment of parliamentarians by political parties irrespective of the order on the voting lists and of ‘blank resignations’, as mentioned in the text of the report we voted on this morning.</p>

I welcome the significant progress made in terms of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, which has been essential for Serbia to be granted EU candidate status. I must, however, stress that these criteria must not only be observed temporarily in order to obtain membership. To us, the high-level recognition and guaranteeing of the collective rights of the Hungarian community living in Serbia’s Vojvodina is of unquestionable national interest. Serbia still has to make significant efforts to ensure high-quality education in minority languages at both state and provincial level, as this is a requisite of preserving ethnic and cultural identity. Moreover, the Serbian authorities must provide the financial resources necessary for the exercise of cultural, educational and language rights associated with the act on national councils. Serbia’s minority policy must be monitored continuously. Still, it is reassuring that despite initial difficulties, the rehabilitation act that has been adopted settles matters of dispute related to collective guilt and places greater emphasis on individual liability. My position is that Serbia’s future progress in the process of European integration will greatly depend on the protection of minorities, on maintaining good neighbourly relations, and on regional cooperation.</p>

For these reasons, it falls to the EU to support the stability of this region that is part of the European continent by approving its candidate country status at the next Council. Beyond the Copenhagen criteria, the country has demonstrated progress in supporting the European EULEX force and the international KFOR force. However, there remains the issue of Kosovo, which is still under sovereignty supervised by the international community; specifically, the UN. On the other hand, Serbia is being asked to sign the latest agreement between Belgrade and Priština on inclusive regional cooperation. Both parties need to continue dialogue and cooperation with each other, so as to boost economic growth and ensure that the public’s freedoms and guarantees are protected, regardless of ethnicity.

Through my vote, I recommended that this status be granted, in view of the efforts made by the Serbian authorities to reform the country and satisfy the requests for extradition to The Hague of those suspected of war crimes. Here, I see the positive will of a resolutely European country, which is committed to integrating into the EU when it is ready. However, there is still a long way to go for this country, which must still integrate a significant part of the Union acquis , implement various essential reforms, improve relations with Kosovo and meet the Copenhagen criteria before attempting to open accession negotiations.

The great powers of NATO and the EU have used aggression and military occupation to create and impose a protectorate, and they want to oblige the Serbian people to accept this violation of their territorial integrity and sovereignty. When added to other processes under way, the process of Serbia’s accession to the EU demonstrates that the purpose of sowing ethnic divisions, of aggression and of support for the destruction of Yugoslavia was the economic domination of its successor states and their natural resources, the exploitation of their workers, and the destruction of their peoples’ immense social achievements. This resolution also seeks to hold Serbia responsible for the legitimate protests that recently took place in Kosovo, attempting to mask the responsibilities of the EU itself and of NATO for the territory’s deteriorating economic and social situation, which is caused, above all, by its continued occupation.</p>

      <p sl="it">The inclusion of Kosovo in the stabilisation and association process (SAP), thanks to which it could benefit from EU assistance (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, IPA) and an independent preferential trade system, would ensure that Kosovo does not remain on the sidelines of the EU’s strategy in the area of the Western Balkans. In its communication of October 2011 on the enlargement strategy, the Commission showed how the post-election period of adjustment prevented Kosovo from making substantial progress in terms of reforms. On the other hand, in its conclusions of 5 December 2011, the Council called upon Kosovo to implement the actions decided on to compensate for these failings. I agree and support the Commission’s intention to carry out a feasibility study for the stabilisation and association agreement between the EU and Kosovo. This commitment confirms the wish and commitment of the EU to carry forward the initiatives outlined in the General Affairs Council conclusions of December 2011 and, at the same time, shows that it can make a significant contribution in socio-political terms, which will be essential for reaching an agreement between Priština and Belgrade on the delicate issue of regional cooperation.</p>

For example, it would have been better to emphasise that the EU mission in Kosovo is not performing its mission in a satisfactory way. So far, little or no detailed investigation has been carried out into organised crime and its connections with the political institutions. Consequently, a large number of crimes continue to go unpunished. I am deeply concerned about the role played by Kosovar political-criminal associations in various criminal activities, including trafficking in drugs and human beings. For this reason, we call on the Kosovar authorities to increase the quality and transparency of the legislative process in order to provide Kosovo with a sound legal framework and to improve confidence in the legal system.

They must play a more active role in the discussions between Serbia and Kosovo. To varying degrees, these countries are concerned that this precedent will encourage or validate separatist movements within their borders, from the Catalans or Basques in Spain, the Hungarian minorities in Romania and Slovakia or the Turks in Cyprus. We are calling on Serbia to continue to show its willingness to achieve the aims of the dialogue that is already under way. A second aspect of the report, which I also fully support, stresses the need for Kosovo to make reforms, particularly constitutional and electoral reforms.

It is necessary to restore the rule of law in this area by intensifying the fight against organised crime and the criminal structures that are using this area as a safe haven outside the control of any authority. In this context, the Kosovar and Serbian authorities should implement a swift and complete removal of all road blocks, and ensure free movement of people and goods, including access to crossing points for the international community and for Kosovo customs officers. Corruption remains a major problem, undermining the citizens’ trust in the rule of law and affecting their access to public services.

      <p sl="ro">The European Union has pursued a clear policy with regard to the Western Balkans and applied it consistently, with Croatia’s recent accession proving that it is correct and productive. Regardless of the fact that some Member States have not recognised Kosovo, its development as a state must comply with a number of principles and values. I am afraid that these principles are not always observed, and there is a significant delay in carrying out democratic reforms. However, there are encouraging signs for the dialogue with Serbia which the EU has done everything in its power to broker and facilitate. The presence of EULEX in Kosovo is a factor that is conducive to resolving numerous current problems between the Kosovar majority and the Serb minority. Progress has also been made on cooperation within the regional mechanisms. I voted for this resolution, not least because it is not an ultimatum on the issue of recognising Kosovo’s independence. It is a step forward also because it recognises the right of every EU Member State to make its own decision on this matter.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I am pleased about the adoption of a resolution on Kosovo which calls on the five EU Member States that have still not yet done so to recognise the independence of Kosovo. The EU must play a more decisive role in the conflict between Kosovo and Serbia, which is essential for ensuring stability and security in the Balkans region. I regret that Serbia is exercising diplomatic pressure to dissuade some countries from recognising Kosovo. With regard to the Belgrade-Priština dialogue, I am pleased that nine rounds of negotiations have already taken place and that they have resulted in several preliminary agreements, including one on integrated management for crossing points in the northern part of the country. It is worrying, however, to note that the previous agreements have not been fully implemented by the Serbian side. All the same, I would highlight the need for Kosovo to implement constitutional and electoral reforms, in terms of public administration and the professionalism of judges and prosecutors, in terms of promoting pluralistic and independent media, and on the important issue of the rule of law. It is also essential to fight against corruption, organised crime and discrimination.</p>

We all remember the conflicts in the Western Balkans, so all efforts to consolidate peace and encourage economic development in the region’s countries are to be welcomed. Despite the political problems between Serbia and Kosovo, the reality is that Kosovo’s declaration of independence has already been recognised by 85 countries, 22 of which are EU Member States. In 2003, at the time of the Thessaloniki European Council, the Western Balkan countries were promised accession to the EU. This commitment was renewed in Sarajevo, in June 2010. We agree that Kosovo’s future is in the EU. We therefore welcome the reforms under way, and we urge the Kosovo authorities to continue combating corruption and organised crime, to work with neighbouring countries, and to gear their structures towards a market economy. I voted for this motion and I hope that the accession negotiations will start shortly, so that all Kosovars can enjoy a more prosperous future.</p>

      <p sl="pt">As we said at the time, and as has been borne out by reality: the unilateral declaration of independence by the Serbian province of Kosovo was an extremely serious event and set a dangerous precedent of disrespecting international law, with potential consequences for the stability of borders that cannot be fully foreseen, particularly on the European continent. It was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Accords, as well as an illegal decision under the most basic principles of international law. It should be stressed that this illegality has still not been acknowledged by many countries, including Member States, despite the desire repeatedly expressed by the majority in Parliament. Reality has shown that the artificial creation of this ‘pseudo-state’ or veritable protectorate under ‘supervised sovereignty’ – a strange concept – did not result from the sovereign will of the people, but rather was imposed using aggression and military occupation by the US, by NATO and by the EU; it is maintained by KFOR, backed up by the European Union’s EULEX mission. This is an attempt by the United States and the major powers of the European Union to use the politics of fait accompli to perpetuate the political, economic and military domination of this important region of Europe.</p>

Regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations are of great significance for the process of European integration, and also play an important role in the effort to ensure security and stability in the region. The declaration of independence of Kosovo has been recognised by 85 countries, including 22 EU Member States. For the EU, it is important to engage in dialogue with Kosovo, and this commitment is of great significance for the preservation of stability and security in the EU’s immediate neighbourhood. I take the view that an important role is also played by the EULEX rule-of-law mission, which is tangible proof of the commitment of the entire EU and its 27 Member States to the improvement of the rule of law in Kosovo. The EU should create initiatives aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of this important mission and ensuring it is accepted throughout Kosovo. Considerable progress has been made in some areas, such as police and customs. However, the core activities in areas focusing on the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as war crimes, should be stepped up so that the mission can deliver more tangible results.</p>

In addition, I also consider the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo highly important, as Euro-Atlantic integration is a goal for both countries. It is very important to ensure that no Balkan country falls behind in the European integration process of the Western Balkans. For Kosovo, obtaining EU membership is essential, as this is the only way for it to settle its post-conflict relations. I firmly believe that Serbia and Kosovo will conclude further agreements, including on the free movement of persons, economic cooperation and the establishment of customs offices at shared border crossing points. This, of course, requires the establishment of additional diplomatic relations and the conclusion of further international conventions. It is also important to note that the country is home to several nationalities; I welcome the fact that Kosovo treats national minorities with due respect as regards language use and other rights.</p>

However, the return of refugees and internally displaced persons remains a challenge for Kosovo. The proposal welcomes the efforts of the Kosovar authorities to support returnees, and encourages further efforts at central and local level to ensure the socio-economic integration of the returnees, paying special attention to the needs of Serbian, Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian returnees. The Kosovar authorities also need to increase the quality and transparency of the legislative process in order to provide Kosovo with a sound legal framework and to improve confidence in the legal system. Meanwhile, the Council and the Commission of the European Union should negotiate a trade agreement with Kosovo as soon as possible, as this is crucial for the development of the country and to fight unemployment successfully.</p>

This is not only the most consistent position with respect to the international community’s proposal for the multi-ethnic states of the Western Balkans and international law (in the absence of an agreement between the parties or a new resolution from the Security Council), but also, rather than being an obstacle, it has turned out to be crucial in terms of stimulating Serbia’s proposal to join the European Union, progress on the Belgrade-Priština dialogue, and stability within the region.

After this major step forward in the dialogue between the two countries, Belgrade and Priština should, from now on, both be able to attend regional meetings, and Priština will be able to open a representative office in Belgrade.

It was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Accords, as well as an illegal decision under the most basic principles of international law. Reality has shown that the artificial creation of a ‘pseudo-state’ under ‘supervised sovereignty’ – whatever that might be – has been anything but sovereign. What it is, in fact, is a protectorate that was created and imposed using aggression and military occupation by the US, by NATO and by the EU, and that is maintained by KFOR, backed up by the European Union’s EULEX mission. It was an attempt by the United States and the major powers of the European Union to use the politics of fait accompli to perpetuate the political, economic and military domination of this extremely important region of Europe. This illegality has still not been acknowledged by many countries, including Member States, despite the desire expressed by the majority in Parliament for that to happen.</p>

      <p sl="fr">I voted in favour of the report by my colleague from the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) Ms Oomen-Ruijten, which calls on Turkey to improve relations with its neighbours. Indeed, I believe that ‘serene’ relations between Turkey and the neighbouring EU Member States are a prerequisite to establishing good relations between Turkey and the European Union. As you will know, relations between Turkey and Cyprus are at the heart of our concerns. I deplore, among others, the threats from Ankara to freeze its relations with the Cypriot Presidency in the second half of 2012 if the conflict is not resolved. However, Turkey must also normalise its relations with Armenia and take action on the Kurdish issue. Aside from diplomatic issues, Turkey must reform its judiciary and ensure respect for freedom of expression and media pluralism, principles at the heart of our European values and our democratic societies.</p>

      <p sl="pl">Turkey continues to be a strategic partner of the West, both in the area of security and of the economy. As a member of NATO, it has been working with the West for stability and peace for 60 years. It is currently also an important channel of access to Caucasian and Caspian liquid fuel deposits, and the planned Nabucco gas pipeline is a key feature of the EU’s energy security. Turkey’s economic potential determines the development of the entire region.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Although neighbourhood policy has brought mutual benefits, Turkey remains the only candidate country which does not have visa liberalisation. I think it is in the interests of the entire Union to extend this programme. Last year’s parliamentary elections demonstrated Ankara’s ability to appoint a democratic authority based on the votes cast by the great majority of society. Turkey’s objective of achieving integration has been expressed by the establishment of a Ministry of EU Affairs. I have high hopes for all the efforts being made in relation to the protection of religious minorities, including mainly Christians. Cooperation with Turkey is an important pillar of Europe’s security strategy. I support the resolution.</p>

      <p sl="it">Turkey’s economic potential is not a valid argument for continuing to support its entry into the EU. Europe in 2012 is a social and market economy where sharing a common attitude to a shared set of values remains the ideological bond that gives meaning to all the sacrifices being asked of each citizen. Turkey not only does not share or respect the EU’s ideological values, as exemplified by its relations with Cyprus, but last year expressed on several occasions its complete disinterest in continuing along the road to accession.

The report therefore stresses that for its own benefit, and with a view to enhancing stability and promoting good neighbourly relations and a positive political and economic partnership, Turkey needs to step up efforts to solve outstanding bilateral issues, including unsettled legal obligations and land and maritime border and airspace disputes with its immediate neighbours, including EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">‘Turkey is making progress but could do better’: that is the message we have just sent to the country by adopting this resolution on the Commission’s 2011 progress report in view of its accession to the EU. The reforms of the judiciary are still too tentative and constitutional reform is stagnating. Little progress has been made to protect civil liberties and ensure the freedom of the media. There are still far too many journalists in pre-trial detention awaiting trial. Reforms also still need to be made to ensure equal rights for women and also children by ensuring greater access to education in particular. We support the Commission’s ‘fresh positive agenda’ aimed at creating new dynamism in EU-Turkey relations. Considering the strategic role of Turkey in the region, the EU is confirming that it wants to strengthen its close cooperation, particularly in terms of foreign policy and neighbourhood policy. The EU remains open to continuing the accession negotiations, but it is up to Turkey to show us its real desire to make progress, and not boycotting the upcoming Cypriot Presidency of the EU would be a good sign.</p>

Turkey’s long road towards something closer to the democratic rule of law is a clear example of this. However, I believe we have to take into account the times in which we live. While the crisis continues and we have not solved our institutional problems with more streamlined decision making, enhanced economic governance and a true citizens’ Europe, continuing down the path of enlargement does not seem prudent to me.

It is good that the resolution emphasises that relations between the EU and Turkey benefit both parties and must be based on mutual engagement. We therefore call on Turkey to continue the reform process in order to achieve concrete results, in particular, with regard to violence against women, freedom of expression and legal guarantees during trials. I particularly welcome the paragraph protecting the rights of minorities. The new Turkish constitution that is being drawn up could provide an historic opportunity to create a more democratic, open and inclusive society. At the same time, it is important for the EU to continue to make progress towards providing visa liberalisation for Turkey. I welcome initiatives for harmonising document requirements in order to facilitate administrative procedures, but more needs to be done to break the deadlock in this situation and create more trust. I fully support the Commission’s positive agenda, which does not constitute an alternative approach, but rather an important complement to, and support for, the membership negotiations. The best way to deal with problems and reforms in Turkey is to engage in an ongoing and constructive dialogue for negotiations regarding membership. The lack of clarity on the part of the EU is creating tension and stalling the reform process in Turkey.</p>

I particularly want to acknowledge the help it is providing to refugees from Syria. The Commission is correct to open the negotiating chapters on judicial reform and fundamental rights early on and to close them at the very end. I am particularly concerned about media reform, freedom of expression, the anti-terror law and the continued interference in legal political activities, including the ongoing trials of elected public representatives. Turkey should provide for full recognition of all its ethnic and religious communities, acknowledge the inclusive nature of modern citizenship and promote the constitutional protection of mother-tongue language rights.

      <p sl="ro">I voted for this resolution because Turkey is one of the European Union’s most important economic and geostrategic partners. With an economy enjoying a spectacular growth rate which has trebled in the last decade, Turkey is one of the most typical emerging powers. In fact, it is playing an increasingly important role in maintaining the balance of stability in the Middle East and in supplying the EU with energy. The EU, for its part, is Turkey’s main economic partner, providing 80% of the foreign investment in this country. Unfortunately, the economic growth has not also been reflected in the per capita GDP or in the progress in tackling poverty, especially among women. I believe that the efforts made to increase the number of girls attending school must be followed by progress in terms of the integration of women at work and their representation at decision-making level. However, tackling violence against women is the main area where more concrete measures need to be taken to eradicate so-called crimes of honour and forced marriages, and to increase the measures providing protection and shelter for women and children who are victims of domestic violence.</p>

However, there remains a lack of convergence in many areas. One example is visa policy, as Turkey is the only candidate country which does not enjoy a visa waiver. One of the reasons for this is the large number of illegal immigrants who use Turkey’s borders to enter EU territory, taking advantage of its position as a focal point. There is also the matter of Turkey failing to implement fully the additional protocol to the association agreement and the Customs Union.</p>

Today, Turkey represents a fundamental partner of the EU and the accession negotiations have not been dealt with in a consistent and balanced way. The Copenhagen criteria have to be considered as the only valuable guidelines for any evaluation of progress made by Turkey in complying with the EU acquis . Parliament should firmly reject the attempt made by conservative and reactionary groups and parties throughout Europe to create obstacles to any serious discussion regarding Turkey’s accession on a merely political and populist base. The future of the European Union depends on its capacity to be inclusive, open to intercultural dialogue, and socially and economically sustainable. The accession of Turkey, once the issues as already identified have been solved, opens the way for that future to happen.</p>

That Turkey has come a long way towards convergence with Europe is undeniable, as are the major discrepancies that the country is displaying during that process.

      <p sl="pt">This report, by Ms Oomen-Ruijten, concerns EU enlargement to include Turkey, which the Council has awarded candidate country status. The EU has privileged relations with Turkey due, not just to its major economic growth, but also to its geostrategic importance in a region located on a key energy corridor for Europe. The EU has expressed willingness to help deliver on the reforms – specifically, drafting a new constitution following the recent elections – under way in Turkey, thereby strengthening cooperative ties and minimising tensions in the region. As such, I hope that the prospect of accession will function as an engine for reform, particularly as regards fundamental rights in relation to freedom of expression and to the judiciary. I voted for this report and I hope that the issues overshadowing Turkey-Cyprus relations will be overcome during the Cypriot Presidency in the second half of this year.

The ultimate goal is controlling the Turkish economy and making use of its geostrategic location in relation to the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia, particularly to access and control those regions’ energy sources and markets. This resolution’s recognition of EU-Turkey interdependence and its ‘significant role for regional stability and energy security’ demonstrates this aim. Turkey is a NATO member and a major player in the region, as demonstrated by the role it is playing in destabilising Syria and in the internal conflict that is still being supported from outside the country’s borders. However, the resolution downplays or ignores the repression of workers, trade unionists and those on the left. The convenient ambiguity about Cyprus is retained, masking the fact that Turkey has taken no steps towards solving the Cyprus problem.

In its progress report for 2011, the Commission concluded that Turkey plays a key role in the security and prosperity of the European Union, that its contribution to the EU in a number of important areas will only become evident when a positive programme and credible access to the negotiation process are ensured, and that it is still extremely important for Turkey to continue reforms relating to the political criteria and to make further considerable efforts to safeguard fundamental rights.

Finally, it is an important regional actor, a strategic partner for our neighbourhood policy.

Its continuing occupation of part of Cyprus; its refusal to open ports and airports in the region; violations of the rights of political, religious and ethnic minorities; discrimination against women; the exclusion of political parties; and the revocation of laws limiting the jurisdiction of military courts are some examples of this. There are other fundamental issues. Most of Turkey is not geographically part of Europe. Turkey has an Islamic identity that is very different from the Judaeo-Christian identity of most EU countries. Strategically speaking, it would be problematic for the EU to have borders with Iraqi Kurdistan. The secularity of the country is only held in place by military force. None of this precludes acknowledgement of the efforts made by Turkey over recent years to meet certain criteria required by the EU, and it recognises the invaluable role that this country plays within NATO. A relevant consideration would be whether it would be better to guarantee Turkey privileged and preferential partnership status with the EU, rather than creating false expectations and hopes of accession, which the facts and circumstances are unlikely to accommodate.</p>

      <p sl="en">Protection of, and respect for, minorities is one of the best signs with which to assess the quality of democracy. Respect for national minorities should be a cornerstone of EU foreign policy when fostering democracy in the world and especially when dealing with states like Turkey that want to join the EU. Turkey should never join the EU unless it carefully respects minority rights. There are about 14 million Kurds in Turkey. The movement for more cultural rights and political autonomy for Kurdistan is currently being brutally repressed by the Turkish Government. Ankara misuses the Penal Code to criminalise peaceful Kurdish journalists, politicians, activists and demonstrators. Dozens of Kurdish MPs are in jail. This is simply unacceptable. The PKK must certainly stop using violence just as much as the Turkish State. The Kurdish conflict will only be addressed politically and, therefore, both sides need to negotiate. In this negotiation, it is unavoidable that the Kurds, sooner or later, will have to be recognised in the constitution. The report does not recognise the rights of the Kurdish minority nor the political nature of the conflict. As a democrat, I had to vote against it.</p>

Leaving aside the numerous criteria requested that still have not been met, a fact recognised by the EU itself, the underlying issue is still, in my opinion, essentially a historical-political one. How can we open up to a country that does not even recognise the sovereignty of one of our Member States, and that is even threatening to cut off relations with Europe because of the impending Presidency of Cyprus? How long will the EU continue to accept these constant outrages? We must not forget that Turkey has been in military occupation of part of another Member State for almost forty years, a fact that is obviously unique and unprecedented in Europe. Turkey is not part of Europe from either a geographical or a historical and religious point of view. Therefore, I do not understand why we want to continue with this absurd enlargement process. We in the Northern League have always been extremely clear on this point. There will be no concession in this direction, and so we will continue our battle for Europe to stay as it is, and therefore that it does not give in to agreements that go against its nature.</p>

      <p sl="en">I am in favour of the EU enlargement policy and the continuation of Turkey’s EU accession negotiations. We need to send a positive and encouraging message to Turkey, which remains strongly committed to the EU integration process. By delaying the opening of the 15th negotiation chapter ‘Energy’, we risk losing the momentum gained in the EU-Turkey’s intensified dialogue on energy. We should further strengthen and broaden the EU-Turkey’s foreign policy dialogue, encourage closer economic relations and further step up cooperation on migration management and border controls, which could pave the way for visa liberalisation with Turkey. A positive agenda initiated by the Commission in 2012 could give new impetus and complement the accession negotiations by creating an additional framework for dialogue at expert level. The implementation of the Ankara Protocol on the Turkish side is a crucial step for the successful continuation of negotiations.</p>

For the European Union, Turkey is not only a candidate country; it is also a country that plays a very important regional role in relations with neighbouring states. The close cooperation between Turkey and the EU is evidence of a close relationship that has lasted for several decades. I therefore welcome the positive approach of the Commission, with which our grouping agrees. The accession negotiations are, unfortunately, not progressing as quickly as we would wish. Turkey still faces many problems and challenges, which include, in particular, the freedom of speech and the Kurdish and Cyprus questions. The potential entry of Turkey into the EU therefore requires that these problems be resolved as quickly as possible, and that the situation regarding the judiciary and the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms be improved.

My summary of Turkey as a candidate country is unambiguous – Turkey repeatedly disqualifies itself because of its unambiguous attitude to the European Union – particularly Cyprus, which is next in line to assume the Council Presidency. I very much doubt that the decades of conflict regarding Cyprus can be resolved so easily, despite the greatest possible efforts on the EU’s part and the enormous level of pre-accession aid paid to Turkey by the EU. Turkey, or at least the Turkish mentality, will never be part of the European Union. Turkey shows clearly that it is not interested in fitting in with European standards or value systems and that we should not expect any significant change in attitude.

Turkey is undoubtedly a country of great strategic importance for the European Union – its position as an energy corridor for Europe, its rapid economic growth and its role as an influential trade partner compels and motivates Europe to place a high priority on accession negotiations. At present, however, there are aspects of Turkey’s internal situation to which one cannot turn a blind eye, for instance, unjustifiably long pre-trial detention periods, restrictions on journalistic freedom and freedom of expression, child poverty, violence against women, etc. In addition, this report reveals the problems that still prevail between Turkey and Cyprus and the need to begin negotiations for the reunification of Cyprus and the withdrawal of Turkish forces from the region, which I consider to be important preconditions for the improvement of cooperation and relations between the European Union and Turkey.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The process of accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU is suffering, not because of the crisis, but because the Turkish authorities are dragging their feet with regard to respect for universal values, which are fundamental to the European Union. Of course, Turkey is a major country with an important strategic role for Europe. We need only highlight its unfailing contributions to NATO and the fact that it is an EU energy corridor for Caucasian and Caspian oil and gas resources. This geostrategic dimension, important though it may be, must not make us want to forget the frequent breaches of respect for the rights of women and minorities. To this we can now add unacceptable anti-Semitic provocations. The advert that was recently broadcast on Turkish television where Hitler extols the virtues of a shampoo ‘for real men’ is the most recent example of this. How is it possible that we still do not have the sense to dare to suggest the credible alternative of a privileged partnership? This would at least have the merit of being clear and responding to the concerns expressed by the majority of European citizens who are worried about possible future ill-prepared accessions, and the absorption capacity of the EU following the waves of accessions in 2004 and 2007.</p>

There is an EU-Turkey agreement purely of an economic nature for the energy sector for both supply and transit, but this cannot suffice for membership of the EU. Unfortunately, the attitude of too many hypocritical pro-Europeans is to pursue an accession process for Turkey. I would like to point out that in the first place, it needs to be a democratic state, and currently it is not in view of the fact that it has put a part of Europe (Northern Cyprus) under military occupation, has not resolved the Kurdish question, and its foreign minister has reiterated that Turkey will not have any contact with the European Presidency-in-office given that it will be Cyprus from July.

As mentioned in paragraph 11, it is of primary importance that Turkey should have a modern and efficient, fully independent and impartial judicial system, guaranteeing due process of law for all citizens. The growing number of new applications to the European Court of Human Rights shows that the objective has not yet been reached. For the purposes of modernisation, the issue raised in paragraph 29 also seems fundamental. The government must (is called upon to) take all the necessary measures to increase the social inclusion of women and their competitiveness in the labour market, especially through policies aiming to diminish the gender gap specifically in secondary education. It is even more important to mention here that Turkey’s military occupation of the northern part of the island of Cyprus without any legitimate claim has been in place ever since 1974.</p>

Judicial procedures have still not, in fact, been sufficiently improved as regards their efficiency and rules to ensure the right to a fair and expeditious trial, including the right to access incriminating evidence and trial documents in the early phases of proceedings and sufficient guarantees for all suspects. Finally, the wide margin of interpretation and application allowed by the Anti-Terror Law and the Criminal Code are a cause for concern, in particular, in cases where membership of a terrorist organisation has not been proven and where an act or statement is deemed to coincide with the aims of a terrorist organisation.</p>

Furthermore, its military potential as a NATO member and its potential as an alternative energy source for the EU are some of the key elements for its accession to the Union. Nevertheless, its non-integration is essentially due to political factors and failure to apply the Copenhagen criteria properly. The Turkish Government is being called on to reform the legal system, to involve all stakeholders in drafting a new civilian constitution, to withdraw the military from politics, and to fully respect human rights and minorities’ rights. There are also the issues of failure to fully apply the additional protocol to the EU-Turkey association agreement, of the lack of visa liberalisation, and of the trade barriers in force.

I should emphasise the economic and growth potential of Turkey and its significant role in supporting regional stability and energy security. Turkey is a major EU energy corridor for Caucasian and Caspian oil and gas resources, while the Nabucco gas pipeline remains one of the EU’s highest energy security priorities. At the same time, Turkey offers significant potential for renewable energy from its solar, wind and geothermal sources. We welcome the progress made by Turkey in the area of renewable energy sources and support future efforts aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy sources in every sector.

In spite of some progress, there are still significant shortcomings, which are putting the brakes on the negotiations on a possible accession. The Commission has decided to complement this process, provided for by the treaties, with a ‘positive agenda’, which regulates the discussions for better convergence between the EU and Turkey. This is a good initiative, but it cannot replace the formal framework of the negotiations. However, it is too early to envisage an EU enlargement to include Turkey, as there are still many obstacles, both internally and externally. Let us not forget that Cyprus will oversee the next Presidency of the EU and that Turkey categorically refuses to recognise this State. In these conditions, and while the EU is based on principles of sincere cooperation and mutual solidarity between its members, how can we imagine any kind of progress? Through my vote, I therefore wanted to reaffirm my desire to make Turkey, above all, a privileged and strategic partner of the EU.

Turkey is an important economic partner for us, and its position as an ally in the Middle East is crucial from the perspective of the West. However, there remain a number of concerns regarding the issues of the alignment of legislation and the enforcement of common values, as well as the Cyprus question. I would nevertheless like to assure our Turkish friends that, although equality before the law is a fundamental condition for the rule of law, the requirements of establishing some sort of ‘equality board’ and taking unspecified action against homophobia are not such conditions. A broad interpretation of the terms ‘discrimination’ and ‘homophobia’ have led to the actual discrimination of many decent people in the EU.

      <p sl="pt">As we have repeatedly stressed, the process of Turkey’s EU accession is being promoted by the major EU powers, which is not lacking in contradictions. Its objectives include integrating this large country with the EU single market, controlling its economy and making use of its geostrategic location in relation to the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia, particularly to access and control those regions’ energy sources and markets. This resolution’s recognition of EU-Turkey interdependence and its ‘significant role for regional stability and energy security’ is enlightening in this regard. Turkey is a NATO member and a major player in the region, as demonstrated by the role it is playing in destabilising Syria. The resolution downplays or ignores the repression of workers, trade unionists, those on the left and the Turkish people. As regards Cyprus, the majority in Parliament is maintaining its customary ambiguity; there can be no clarity, as Turkey has taken no steps towards recognising the EU Member State of Cyprus, refuses to engage with the EU Presidency in the second half of 2012, and is still occupying the north of the island militarily, in breach of UN resolutions.</p>

Although it is on the right path, it is essential that Montenegro continue its efforts in order to start negotiation procedures for its accession to the EU.</p>

      <p sl="hu">The Balkan region is of key importance to the European Union in terms of both economic policy and geopolitical aspects. Over the past few years, Montenegro has made several efforts and has laboured with determination to gain membership of the European Union. The country must be an integral part of the enlargement process and we must provide it with all the necessary support in this. The country is well on its way to fulfilling the Copenhagen political criteria, and has delivered satisfactory results on the whole. For further progress, however, efforts to reinforce the rule of law must be maintained, in particular, in respect of cases of high-level corruption and organised crime. I support Montenegro’s accession.</p>

      <p sl="pt">Montenegro is a very pretty country in the Western Balkans where tourism is crucial to the economy, which is reflected in its good neighbourly relations. Following the Montenegrin Parliament’s official declaration of 3 June 2006, the United Nations recognised the Republic of Montenegro as an independent state on 28 June 2006. The European Council awarded it candidate country status in December 2010, as part of the policy of EU expansion. In light of this report, I welcome the progress made by Montenegro towards accession, particularly the constitutional reform under way through constructive dialogue with the opposition parties, the struggle against corruption and organised crime, judicial reform and the guarantee of respect for fundamental rights.

Reality has demonstrated that, after exacerbating ethnic divisions by seeking to replace the administrative borders of Yugoslavia with ethnic borders, the situation not only failed to improve, but these peoples’ living conditions also declined. The ethnic divisions are far from over and there is a serious risk that new conflicts will emerge in Montenegro and the region’s other countries. ‘Europe’ is now being presented as a joyful step for the future, with its virtues being contrasted with the disasters of the past, but they forget that these disasters were instigated or backed by the major powers of NATO and the EU.

Significant progress has been achieved by Montenegro in meeting the seven key priorities identified by the Commission in 2010; specifically, improvements in the work of Parliament and the electoral framework, the professionalism of the public administration, the independence of the judiciary, combating corruption, combating organised crime, ensuring media freedom, and strengthening cooperation with civil society. The country has seen a modest economic recovery, along with low inflation and a significant inflow of foreign direct investment, as well as a slight decrease in the unemployment rate, and it has also implemented the trade-related provisions of the stabilisation and association agreement with the EU. However, it needs to pursue further reform efforts in efficiently implementing the government’s action plan on the key priorities and in accelerating the recovery from the economic crisis whilst simultaneously ensuring proper control of public spending and foreign debt.

Naturally, both Serbia and Montenegro still have a long way to go.

Montenegro has thus achieved a high degree of compliance with the membership criteria and Parliament wanted to highlight that in its resolution. Nonetheless, efforts should still be made in the economic sector as the slowing down of growth could exacerbate unemployment, which is already high. Significant structural reforms must be adopted in order to stimulate solid growth and improve the living conditions of Montenegrins.

In view of the problems facing Montenegro in the energy sector, we welcome the adoption of the government plan on energy policy until 2030.

Moreover, the fratricidal wars in which it became involved and their brutal impact on neighbouring countries and on the entire international community had unfortunate consequences for the country and its people. The so-called ‘war’ in Kosovo, which remains unresolved and very controversial throughout the international community, has also contributed to the fact that peace is still not a reality in the region.

Every candidate country is also required to have excellent relations with its neighbours, and therefore Serbia must, in future, be able to demonstrate improvements in its relations with Kosovo, meaning that it must face the country’s independence. Kosovo has been recognised as an independent state by 65 countries worldwide, including 22 out of 27 Member States of the European Union.

What financial framework is needed to enable these generally very poor countries to integrate into the internal market and, above all, become competitive in the euro area?

In its report, Parliament stresses that it is essential to create a more transparent, stable, reliable and accountable corporate sector in the EU, with improved corporate governance. It is therefore regrettable that important corporate governance issues such as board decision making, directors’ responsibility, directors’ independence, conflicts of interest or stakeholders’ involvement have been left out of the Green Paper by the Commission. Parliament also stresses that it is a prerequisite that a well-governed company should be accountable and transparent to its employees, shareholders and, where appropriate, to other stakeholders. I welcome the position expressed by Parliament that the corporate sector should take social, ethical and environmental concerns into account in its practices, and also strive for better economic performance and stimulate the creation of decent jobs.</p>

      <p sl="it">The report recognises that the Green Paper took an important step forward in rationalising the corporate governance system. As such, it requires a critical review involving recommendations representing the wealth offered by the variety of corporate cultures in the EU. The recommendations on boards of directors and the rights of shareholders are particularly important. The social tensions currently characterising the continent, sparked off by the financial crisis, have, in fact, dramatically and urgently returned to the top of the agenda the need to promote the values of transparency, rigour, moderation and recognition of the value of human capital, within a framework of principles that is as uniform as possible. During the last few years, the lack of a culture of moderation and sobriety, transparency and counterbalances, has generated distortions and bad practices, the negative repercussions of which have regularly been felt by the majority of people. Without prejudice to a respectful approach to national cultures and the principles of individual and corporate freedom, the Green Paper – as amended by the recommendations in the report – is an act of responsible governance that firmly tackles tendencies and anomalies that are damaging for European citizens. For these reasons, I voted in favour of the report.</p>

      <p sl="en">I firmly believe that shareholders’ engagement with European companies should be encouraged by enhancing their role, but that this engagement should be a discretionary choice and never an obligation. In view of the fact that the Shareholders’ Rights Directive endorses the principle of equal treatment of shareholders, and that all shareholders (institutional or not) are therefore entitled to receive the same information from a company, irrespective of their stake, the Commission should bring forward proposals for Europe-wide guidelines on the type of information released to shareholders in annual company reports. I also think it is right for the Commission to review all relevant legislation, in order to assess whether any requirements have inadvertently encouraged short-termism. The Commission should consider amending the Shareholders’ Rights Directive in such a way as to evaluate by what means shareholder participation can be further enhanced. An impact assessment should also be carried out to analyse the role of electronic voting at general meetings of listed companies, for the purpose of encouraging shareholders’ participation, especially with regard to cross-border shareholders.</p>

It is therefore crucial to create a more transparent, stable and reliable European corporate sector. Despite the Green Paper’s important contributions, some corporate governance issues urgently need tackling, such as directors’ responsibility and independence, board constitution and decision making, conflicts of interest, and the involvement of stakeholders, particularly minority shareholders. We need companies that look to the future and do not just think about immediate profit to satisfy shareholders, but that seek to ensure the company’s stability and financial sustainability.

It also includes the habitual federalist impulses, the realisation of which has been resulting in the systematic withdrawal of workers’ rights, and in ever-increasing problems for small and medium-sized enterprises, for young people, and for the victims of the precariousness to which we want to condemn them, claiming it is a characteristic of modernism.

It also clearly establishes that it is the shareholders who are responsible for appointing board members and specifies the way in which this is to be done. These are important principles for us. The report also contains a passage in which the Commission is called on to come up with legislative proposals on the setting of quotas for the representation of women on corporate boards.

      <p sl="sk">The Commission has recently reiterated its commitment to building a strong and successful single market that will focus on citizens and regain their trust. The key elements in these efforts are corporate governance and corporate social responsibility. Corporate governance is traditionally defined as the system by which companies are managed and controlled, and as a set of relationships between the management of a company, its board of directors, the shareholders, and other stakeholders. According to the available study, the overall quality of corporate statements relating to governance when the recommended corporate governance code is deviated from is unsatisfactory. The study showed that, in more than 60% of cases, when companies decide not to follow a recommendation, they do not provide an adequate explanation. The companies simply stated, without any explanation, that they had deviated from the recommendations, or they provided only a general or limited explanation. In many Member States, however, a slow but gradual improvement may be seen in this area. More could be achieved by introducing more detailed requirements for the information to be published by companies that deviate from the recommendations. The requirements should be clear and precise, because many of the current problems arise from misunderstandings of the nature of the required explanations.</p>

      <p sl="en">As one of the shadow rapporteurs for this topic on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), I think that the Commission’s Green Paper recognised several difficulties that reduce the efficiency of the EU’s corporate governance framework and limit the system’s usefulness. To avoid these problems, we will, as a result of today’s vote, reinforce certain requirements at EU level by including soft regulation. In agreement with the ECON Committee, we thought that the financial crisis revealed a lack of effectiveness in existing corporate governance principles. In the end, we came to a common compromise, which was a great success. A really sensitive issue – and one included in opinions from several committees – is gender equality. Nonetheless, promoting women to boards has an indisputably positive effect; that is why I called also on the Commission to put in place definite initiatives to ensure women are better represented on boards of directors. To summarise, I can say that we reached these goals by stressing that a well-governed company should be accountable and transparent to its employees, its shareholders and other stakeholders. It reaffirms that directors of institutions have to take account of sustainability and long-term interests when taking decisions, in order to minimise risks.</p>

      <p sl="en">It has become evident in the wake of the financial crisis that the quality of consumer protection and safeguards in the financial service sector require tangible and strong improvement, particularly with regard to monitoring and supervisory aspects. Member States should monitor whether companies provide their shareholders with the appropriate corporate governance statements in order to ensure full transparency and improve shareholder knowledge of corporate governance practices, thus helping to protect shareholders and citizens against excessive risk taking and short-termism. Therefore, while accepting a number of the paragraphs in the Bodu report on the corporate governance framework, such as the distinction between unitary and dualistic company systems, and mentioning of shareholder participation, I believe that the report should have addressed more fair and sustainable governance measures which attempt to improve Europe’s corporate culture, such as worker participation and gender balance.</p>

Some essential issues must be taken into consideration, such as equality between men and women within companies, including through the use of gender quotas, so that we do not miss out on the potential for growth represented by the female part of the active population. Therefore, women must be properly represented on company boards, places of power from which they are too often excluded.</p>

I am concerned that the Commission, in its Green Paper, emphasised the unitary system of corporate governance, and barely reflected the importance of the dual system at all. There is also a need to pay great attention to transparency and conflict of interest in corporate governance. When placing obligations on businesses and their governing boards, it is necessary always to bear in mind the fact that the various measures should be proportionate to the size of the company, and should not create an additional administrative burden.</p>

In the light of the errors that led to the spread of the international economic crisis, it is important to emphasise the importance of clear rules for regulating the markets. The corporate sector should therefore be able to take social, ethical and environmental concerns into account and to demonstrate its responsibilities towards both employees and shareholders and towards society at large, as well as ensuring better economic performance and the creation of decent jobs. A high level of transparency and a single governance model is necessary, and this can be achieved through judicial integration and harmonisation by the various EU Member States.</p>

      <p sl="pt">On 5 April 2011, the European Commission published the Green Paper on the EU corporate governance framework, which was intended to analyse the effectiveness of the present model for European companies and how to make them easier to govern. I am voting for this report because it is intended to foster a growing relationship between a company’s board and all stakeholders, such as shareholders, suppliers and customers; to include independent individuals on boards of directors; to adopt transparent measures and merit criteria as regards human resources, so as to enhance staff’s skills and talents; and to safeguard an appropriate work/life balance. I agree with the rapporteur that corporate governance rules should not be too rigid, but a number of core measures should be enshrined in all companies, whilst bearing in mind the size, complexity and business activity of each individual company. There should be periodic financial audits and external evaluations, since these are useful instruments for evaluating the effectiveness of corporate governance. I would take this opportunity to stress that I disagree with the proposal of women’s quotas on corporate boards, since I do not believe they need such subterfuge to demonstrate their skills, qualifications and business knowledge.</p>

I voted in favour of Amendment 3, which calls on the Commission to present, as soon as possible, comprehensive, up-to-date data on female representation within all types of companies in the EU and on the compulsory and non-compulsory measures taken by the business sector, as well as those recently adopted by Member States with a view to increasing female representation. The report also calls on the Commission, if, following this exercise, the steps taken by Member States and companies are found to be inadequate, to propose legislation, including quotas, by 2012 to increase female representation in corporate management bodies to 30% by 2015 and to 40% by 2020, while taking account of Member States’ responsibilities and their specific economic, structural (especially relating to company size), legal and regional characteristics.

      <p sl="sk">Responsibility for the management of companies belongs to those who own them – the shareholders. Our duty is to create a legislative framework in which every shareholder can decide on his property. It is not for us to prescribe to companies how many women have to sit on their boards. Our task is to ensure that every citizen, man or woman, enjoys the same civil, property and labour rights. If we start to assume responsibility for people’s decisions, we will deprive them of their freedom and initiative. This will be the end of business and the functioning economy. The EU cannot guarantee people prosperity, because prosperity is born out of risk. I have lived in a country that, in an effort to eliminate market speculation and so-called excessive profits, first abolished the stock exchange, and then business itself.

      <p sl="pt">This report is yet another contribution to Parliament’s attempted whitewash of the real causes and consequences of the crisis we are currently experiencing; a spurious attempt to prolong the capitalist system, as if its predatory and exploitative nature could be reformed. What the workers need is not for the board to demonstrate that it is ‘accountable and transparent’, as this report claims. We are well aware what these expressions mean from the mouth of Big Capital: deliberate avoidance of asserting socially progressive measures; subterfuge to duck advocating fair wealth distribution; empty words that cannot replace the need to defend and implement fair wages, collective bargaining, and an end to precariousness. As the crisis advances, it becomes increasingly urgent to do away with the illusion that the pyromaniacs can be asked to come and put out the fire they themselves started. There is a need to respect national sovereignty and promote harmonisation; there is a need to stop prescribing panaceas that do not attack the root of the problem; there is a need to defend micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, pensioners, and young people. That will only be possible by definitively breaking with this system.</p>

      <p sl="ro">The European Investment Bank (EIB) has recently become one of the most important financial institutions in the European Union. The increase in the disbursements on lending – EUR 52 billion for Member States and EUR 6 billion for countries outside the European Union in 2010 – highlights the important role the EIB continues to play at a European level. At a time when one of the key priorities of Member States and the European Union is to overcome the effects of the global economic and financial crisis, it is crucial to enhance the role played and instruments used by the EIB. I think that the activities carried out by the EIB to support Europe’s economies and stimulate the processes for boosting economic growth and increasing the level of employment must be encouraged by European institutions and Member States. Likewise, the EIB’s practice of presenting its annual lending reports to the European Parliament must be formalised as an integral part of the European Union’s policies for achieving the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>

As the text recalls, the EIB supports the realisation of major European objectives. The report welcomes, in particular, the support granted by the EIB to EU SMEs, which have become a key priority. However, the report also recognises the efforts made in terms of remedying economic and social imbalances in poor regions and combating climate change. This last point is particularly important to me because, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), I am committed to sustainable investment by EU SMEs. The report also recommends the mobilisation of Structural Funds, the advantages of which are still little known, and about which I continue to communicate on a daily basis.</p>

The EIB should use its resources and instruments in the best possible way to fight the current financial and economic crisis. The European Parliament also welcomes the assistance provided by the EIB, in cooperation with the EU Structural Funds, to countries facing financial difficulties, including loans to cover part of the national contribution to projects supported by those funds.

      <p sl="it">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work, for which I voted. The European investment Bank (EIB) has been one of the most important arms of the European Union for achieving its strategic goals for more than 50 years. In fact, thanks to its action in supporting the real economy, its activity must continue to be strongly encouraged in order to successfully develop its policies at European level. The EIB is the ‘European bank’ and its strong commitment in this direction represents an important added value to the economic policies introduced by the EU to support growth. In 2010, the EIB successfully completed its two-year anti-crisis activities and started returning to pre-crisis lending levels, and in adopting the new Corporate Operational Plan for the period 2011-2013, the Board of Directors identified the three main priorities on which it will focus: supporting the Europe 2020 strategy, combating climate change and backing the EU external policy. Finally, the financing operations still represent an essential instrument for guaranteeing greater support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the real economic engine of the European economy, and the results need to be evaluated not only in terms of quantity but also of quality.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report mainly covers two types of issues: financial controls and future lending policy. The ECR could have supported the parts of the report regarding financial controls. The report also, however, makes recommendations regarding current/future lending priorities. Where these are based on a sound commercial footing, the ECR Group can support them. However, too many of the proposals were too specific and represent an attempt to micromanage EIB lending policy according to criteria that were ill-defined. The ECR takes a cautious position on project bonds and feels they need to be organised on a trial basis, with effective scrutiny of the potential liability, and so should not yet be given unconditional support. The report also fails to adequately address the issue of unrestricted liability for Member States’ governments and the consequent effect on risk management and accountability with the EIB.

However, we have concerns and reservations about several of the issues in the report and disagree with some of them, such as public-private partnerships, alignment with the Europe 2020 strategy, the way the so-called project bonds will be implemented and the increased EIB role in the ‘balanced and steady development of the internal market’.</p>

With regard to the 2010 annual report, the bank successfully completed its two-year anti-crisis activities and started returning to pre-crisis lending levels. Key successes in the period in question include, for example, the completion of the schedule for signed loans for SMEs totalling EUR 30 billion one year early, the completion of the European recovery support package amounting to EUR 61 billion, a 30% increase in the loans disbursed for convergence goals, and a total volume of lending amounting to EUR 72 billion. In 2010, the bank’s board of directors adopted a new Operational Plan for the period 2011-2013, which gave the bank three main dimensions to its activities: supporting the Europe 2020 strategy, combating climate change, and backing up the EU external policy objectives.

      <p sl="sk">Each year, the European Investment Bank contributes to the promotion of growth and economic development in the European Union and beyond. Support for projects aimed at increasing employment, social inclusion and the development of disadvantaged regions provides funds where they are most needed. I therefore welcome the 2010 annual report of the European Investment Bank and also encourage the EIB to target its operations on activities that will help overcome the effects of the financial and economic crisis and restore growth. The increased volume of loans for structural programmes is certainly a step in the right direction. I believe, however, that the funds should not be limited to countries with serious financial difficulties, but should also be released more flexibly to the convergence regions. In conclusion, I would like to express the conviction that greater transparency and the publication of lists of final beneficiaries of loans will help to improve the allocation of the available resources and increase awareness of EIB projects.</p>

I acknowledge the strong commitment of the bank to being ‘the European bank’, to having a leading role in reviving the European economy and to supporting growth. It should be noted that, in 2010, the EIB increased funding available for climate-related projects to EUR 19 billion, up from EUR 16 billion in 2009. The EIB’s focus on climate change is very significant. It is important, however, for the EIB to refrain from funding certain types of projects which have a devastating environmental and social impact. The EIB should also do everything possible to align bank operations fully with the EU objectives for a swift transition to a low carbon economy. The EIB should continue its support for the Europe 2020 strategy by leveraging the Structural Funds and making further use of innovative financial instruments. The Europe 2020 strategy’s project bonds initiative is very important in this regard.</p>

I think that we must stress the need to lay down actual rules in order to specifically guarantee projects completed outside the territory of the EU Member States and to introduce appropriate legislation to avoid the risk of dissipating the allocated funding.

The bank’s approved corporate operational plan for the years ahead gives three main dimensions to its activities: implementing the Europe 2020 strategy, combating climate change and supporting the EU’s external policy. The most active strategies and efforts of the bank should centre around these issues, and it should concentrate, above all, on being the ‘European bank’.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The European Investment Bank (EIB) was created in 1958 by the Treaty of Rome. Its main objective is to contribute to the development of the internal market and to reducing the development differences between the various regions. It lent EUR 72 billion in 2010, with EUR 8.5 billion going to developing countries. I am voting for this report on the EIB’s activities, since 32% of its loans went towards the trans-European transport network, it contributed to implementing the Seventh Framework Programme, it loaned more than EUR 30 billion to companies, and it supported around 115 000 small and medium-sized enterprises by awarding credit lines worth EUR 10 billion. Owing to the lack of market capital, it is hard for the European Union, the Member States and businesses to invest. As such, I believe the Governors of the EIB should be called on to agree to a significant increase in capital, thereby increasing EIB activity regarding productive investments that boost rapid economic growth, generate wealth and create jobs.</p>

The EIB’s financing operations inside the EU focus on six priorities: ensuring economic and social cohesion and convergence; implementing the knowledge-based economy; developing trans-European transport and access networks; supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); protecting and improving the environment and promoting sustainable communities; and supporting sustainable, competitive and secure energy. We encourage the EIB to continue its activities to support the development of the European economy and foster growth, stimulate employment, and promote social and territorial cohesion, with a particular focus on projects for the less developed regions. We support the bank in its commitment to focus on the ‘knowledge triangle’ linking education, research and development, as well as innovation.

As European Parliament mediator for international child abduction cases, I have seen how, in recent years with free movement, there has been an increase in dual-nationality families, which are affected by approximately 140 000 divorces a year. The problem is made worse when child custody is an issue, as this is often problematic and regulated differently from one country to the next. An obvious example is Germany, with its Jugendamt , which gives greater rights to a German parent over a foreign one when deciding on custody, trying with all possible means to stop the child being taken out of Germany.

The case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union has, over the years, given increasing substance to European citizenship, placing free movement at the forefront as the basic right which gives rise to a wide array of other essential rights for citizens.

I would like to recall that almost 80 million people with disabilities in the European Union still face obstacles, insurmountable in many instances, when, in various ways, they exercise their right of free movement as citizens of the EU.

The report must therefore produce a greater sense of belonging in European identity, which needs not only to be recreated but also developed, and the European Year of Citizens, which will be celebrated in 2013, needs to be used to show citizens that freedom of movement also means the free exercising of rights in Europe.

The proposals contained in this report also reflect many other expectations from our fellow citizens with regard to making online purchases, moving home, children’s rights, employment, health care abroad, and so on. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must show citizens that, with free movement, there is also the free use of rights within Europe.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The number of European citizens living in a Member State other than their own was around 12 million in 2009. However, one in five European citizens was still encountering a number of obstacles to the right to freedom of movement and establishment within Member States’ territories. Moreover, citizens face obstacles to exercising their rights to social security, and to recognition of degrees and vocational qualifications. Furthermore, many citizens do not have complete and thorough information about their rights, particularly to study, work, retire or live in another Member State. I voted for this report because it calls for better coordination between the Member States on implementing already existing legislation, and calls on the Commission to make more information about the European Union available to the public.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The right to freedom of movement and establishment within the Member States’ territory is the most tangible expression of the benefits of EU citizenship. While there were already almost 12 million EU citizens living in a Member State other than their own in 2009, one in five encounters too many obstacles to exercising this right, specifically with regard to their right to entry, to permanent residence, to the rights of family members, to accessing benefits, to recognition of university and vocational qualifications, and many more. However, the main obstacle to exercising EU citizenship actively is the citizens’ lack of knowledge of their rights. It is crucial that all citizens wanting to study, work, retire or live in another Member State have access to clear and practical information about their rights that is specific to each country, in case they want to stay there. The Member States should also coordinate better in terms of taxation, social security, etc. and should remove any remaining legal and administrative obstacles, so as to facilitate the exercise of these rights and eliminate any contradictions that may still exist between national and European legislation.</p>

      <p sl="ro">There are still numerous obstacles preventing the achievement of EU citizenship. This citizenship should grant rights, including the right to free movement and to reside within Member States, the right to vote and stand as a candidate in the European Parliament and municipal elections in the Member State of residence, and the right to consular protection. Unfortunately, seven years after the entry into force of the Free Movement Directive, for instance, many people who ought to be benefiting from this are still experiencing difficulties in entering or settling in another Member State. The expulsion of the Roma population by the French authorities in 2010 was a blatant example of a violation of fundamental rights. Given that all the obstacles to European citizens’ rights need to be dismantled, I voted in favour of the EU citizenship report 2010.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The right to the free movement of persons and goods is one of the core benefits for all Member State citizens, who benefit from a legal framework that protects them. However, not all the Member States fully apply citizen-related protection legislation. The 2010 report on how EU citizenship is performing suggests there is a need to eliminate obstacles to European Union citizens’ exercising their rights. One of the most frequent complaints concerns the limitations experienced by some to their right to mobility, specifically with regard to the bureaucratic and administrative burden that they need to resolve, particularly in relation to family and friends. I welcome the proposal of 2013 as ‘European Year of Citizens’, although I believe that an allocation of EUR 1 million is clearly very low. I also welcome all the measures for cutting red tape, such as the ‘Your Europe’ portal and the process for registering cars already registered in another Member State. Finally, I should like to call for an information campaign on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, since 85% of citizens are not aware of it.</p>

We could also mention a number of important guidelines on disabled people and access to health care, despite this all being tackled within the context and the logic of the single market and the deepening thereof. This report is punctuated by the usual federalist rhetoric, openly setting a series of aspects of national legislation against European legislation. It enthuses about the European Citizens’ Initiative, calling it the ‘first instrument of transnational participatory democracy’, and calls for its implementation, glossing over its limitations and the current context of severe limitations on democracy in the EU. It proposes a series of harmonisations, specifically on fiscal and social security issues. Moreover, it gives the impression, of course, that more products and more competitive prices are essential to this ‘European citizenship’, with the deepening of the single market, etc. The comments regarding European political parties are simply unacceptable.</p>

      <p sl="sk">The concept of citizenship of the European Union, introduced by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, added a new political dimension to the original economic nature of European integration. Every person holding the nationality of an EU Member State is now also automatically a citizen of the European Union. EU citizenship does not replace national citizenship. Instead, it confers upon all EU citizens additional rights, guaranteed by the EU Treaties, that relate to their everyday lives. Its aim is to be the fundamental status of Member States’ nationals, enabling those who find themselves in the same situation to enjoy, within the scope of the Treaty, the same treatment in law irrespective of their citizenship. Those taking advantage of the European project by extending aspects of their life beyond national borders, through travel, study, work, marriage, retirement, buying or inheriting property, voting, or shopping online from companies established in other Member States, must be able to fully enjoy their rights under the Treaties. However, a gap still remains between the applicable legal rules and the reality in citizens’ daily lives, particularly in cross-border situations. The necessity of making EU citizenship more effective in practice has been stressed on several occasions. I firmly believe that it is legitimate and important to strive to reinforce EU citizenship by revitalising the link between the citizens and the EU and by giving effect to their rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">The ordinary citizen’s perception and understanding of the European Union and its institutions is low, non-existent, confused or even negative. The large majority of EU citizens view the European Union and, in particular, the single market as a system imbued with political horse-trading and vested interests. Changing citizens’ perceptions and bridging the gap between citizens and the EU will not be an easy task. We need a new paradigm of political thinking, putting citizens at the heart of European Union policy making. I support the Vălean report on the EU citizenship report 2010, the focus of which is the obstacles that citizens face in their day-to-day lives and the steps that need to be taken in order to remove those obstacles, such as facilitating access to cross-border health care, free movement of people, recognition of professional qualifications and reducing administrative hurdles and language barriers. I must state that although I am in favour of tax coordination and eliminating tax barriers in the Member States, which further encourage citizens to move across borders, I do not think that at this stage, complete harmonisation of European tax and security rules will benefit all of the EU’s Member States.</p>

      <p sl="fr">The report that we have adopted by a very large majority this week aims to list the obstacles to European citizenship that still exist and persist (with regard to free movement, recognition of qualifications and non-discrimination, for example) and to firmly ask Member States to remove these difficulties. Beyond that, citizenship should be the European Union’s number one priority as, without European citizens, there would be no Europe and we could not construct Europe, especially in the context of the economic crisis, the crisis of values that we are facing today. There is currently only a slight sense of European citizenship. Yet, this lack of ‘European sentiment’, this lack of involvement from citizens in the European Union and the EU’s lack of transparency for European citizens are Europe’s greatest flaws. What European citizens are missing is the feeling of belonging to a European community and this is vital for the European Union.</p>

      <p sl="fr">On Thursday, 29 March, the European Parliament voted on the report on dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights, which sets out 25 proposals aimed at improving our citizens’ daily lives when moving, working, studying, shopping and exercising their political rights. In this report focusing on citizenship, which I support wholeheartedly, Parliament saw fit to single out France by referring to the 2010 Roma episode, thus reopening a closed chapter which, at the time, was the subject of a good deal of misinterpretation and distraction. Must I remind my fellow Members that the Commission itself decided against bringing infringement proceedings against France, and that in deciding to evacuate the illegal camps, the authorities were simply implementing court rulings? In no way was it a deportation of residents on the basis of their ethnic origin: they were accompanied back to the border primarily on a voluntary basis. This malicious distortion for political purposes is unworthy of all those who have conveyed this false message. To record inaccurate information in a report that places citizens at the heart of its concerns is not exactly the role that we expect the European Parliament to play.</p>

      <p sl="it">Free movement is one of the EU’s most cherished achievements, which is also confirmed by the fact that 88% of European citizens (interviewed) recognise it as the most familiar of the four freedoms introduced by the EU. The programmes relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, together with increased synergy with other EU programmes, can undoubtedly help to give new impetus to the concept of European citizenship and to dismantle the obstacles that are still restricting it. Accordingly, the proper functioning of the single market is based on dismantling the obstacles to economic and social cohesion in the EU, which can be achieved, as the Commission has reiterated, by updating Directive 2005/36/EC in order to allow for the swifter, less bureaucratic recognition of professional qualifications. The European Year of Citizens in 2013 must represent an additional opportunity for Europe to dismantle the further obstacles that still prevent European citizens from fully enjoying their rights as European citizens, and help to build a single market at the service of citizens. Finally, it should be emphasised that while EU citizenship is often considered secondary to national citizenship, it can be used as a ‘preparatory citizenship’ for non-EU citizens who meet certain conditions, such as ‘good conduct’.</p>

      <p sl="de">I am very grateful to Ms Vălean and, in particular, Mr Boulland for such a good report. A whole host of rights and benefits are associated with citizenship of the European Union. In order to be able to exercise these rights, however, Europe’s citizens first need to be aware of their existence. This requires two-way communication, drawing citizens’ attention to their rights and to the opportunities available. On the other hand, we also need feedback about any problems that may arise. This process will not only increase the enjoyment of rights within the EU, but also, hopefully, increase confidence in the Union’s positive achievements.</p>

      <p sl="pl">For years, there have been proposals for democratisation of the EU with the aim of extending the ever closer economic cooperation by adding the element of citizenship. The next stage of this was the reform of the Lisbon Treaty, in which the concept of European Union citizenship was more precisely defined and an open list drawn up of the rights arising from this. In view of the fact that introducing changes to the Treaties is only the beginning of ‘opening up’ the Union to the citizens, the institutions face the important task of creating legislation which makes it possible to put the Treaties into effect. The Commission report under discussion sums up one year of these efforts. It identifies 25 fundamental obstacles that stand in the way of freedoms and citizens’ rights. One point which should be emphasised is the fact that the failure to put citizens’ rights into effect has meant that citizens do not fully enjoy the freedom of movement or other benefits which being part of the European Union should entail. As well as drawing attention to the obstacles, the report identifies measures which the Commission should put in place in order to mitigate them.</p>
      <p sl="pl">It is necessary to agree with the opinion of the Commission and the rapporteur that the most important cause of these obstacles is the low level of citizens’ awareness of EU matters in the Member States and the insufficient enforcement of existing legislation, particularly of that which arises from directives. The unsatisfactory form of legislation appears to be a secondary factor, although this does not mean the legislation is not important.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The proposed measures, such as setting up one-stop shops, bringing the e-justice portal into use and adopting subsidiary legislation in the area of family and inheritance law, for example, are the right methods for resolving the problems under discussion. The resolution should be given unanimous support.</p>

      <p sl="en">Although citizens’ rights are clearly enshrined in the EU’s legal acts, they are not always upheld in practice. Therefore, many people feel disenchanted with the European project. The Committee on Petitions (PETI) attempts to rectify these shortcomings by placing citizens at the heart of its activities. Turning its political influence to good account, it enters into direct dialogue with national or regional authorities in the Member States concerned and tries to find quick, non-judicial remedies to the issues raised with it. In instances bringing forward allegations of serious infringements of EU law, which merit further consideration by the Court of Justice of the European Union, the PETI Committee closely cooperates with the Commission for the initiation of infringement proceedings. Consequently, citizens’ rights are constantly promoted and secured through the petitions process.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU citizenship report 2010 lays out a number of admirable aims. However, as is often the case in the European Union, the report stretches beyond a justifiable level into areas which the EU should leave to Member States. A call for the revision of Ley de Costas (the Spanish coastal law) is one example of a welcome proposal, where people have unfairly found themselves exploited by a change in property law. I support sensible calls such as this. However, harmonising tax and social security systems across Europe is going too far. Member States must have jurisdiction in these areas and I know I am speaking for a majority of the British citizens whom I represent when I say this. I also find it difficult to support an increase in budget funds for Euronews and for publicising the European Year of Citizens.

      <p sl="de">Citizenship of the European Union gives rise to a legal relationship between the citizen and the Union that includes rights and obligations. These rights include freedom of movement, the prohibition of discrimination, electoral rights at both local and European level, diplomatic and consular protection, the right of petition and complaint, and the right to communicate with the EU in one of the official languages of the EU and to receive an answer in the same language. The ‘EU citizenship report 2010’ showed that the citizens of the European Union avail themselves of their right to freedom of movement in particular. This means that, in principle, every EU citizen has the right to freedom of movement within the European Union, allowing them to travel to and reside in any other Member State. However, this right of residence can be restricted to protect the legitimate interests of the Member States. I did not vote in favour of the report, as I believe that national regulations, in particular in relation to residence rights of citizens of third countries, should not be undermined by superior European Union law.</p>

      <p sl="it">I am in favour of the EU citizenship report presented by the Commission in 2010. The analysis carried out based on interviews with Member State citizens shows that there need to be effective amendments to ensure that there are common policies to safeguard and guide European citizens and freedom of movement, informal problem-solving networks and adequate communication for full enjoyment of the rights enshrined by the Treaties.</p>

      <p sl="pt">In the ‘EU citizenship report 2010: dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights’, the European Commission introduced the main obstacles faced by European Union citizens in the various areas of their lives. Obstacles to freedom of movement and residence, to exercising social security rights, and to recognition of university and vocational qualifications were identified, along with double taxation and citizens’ lack of awareness of their rights, including the right to petition. This report calls for better coordination between the Member States on implementing already existing legislation, and calls on the Commission to make more information about the European Union available and to ask the public how they prefer to receive information. I voted for this report, as I believe that EU citizens exercising their rights in full is essential to realising the European project.</p>

      <p sl="fr">While European citizenship has now been established for 20 years and has since been enhanced by the Lisbon Treaty, there are still too many difficulties curbing its exercise. I welcome the vote on this report, which I supported. It has the merit of containing relevant proposals aimed at dismantling the obstacles to free movement and pointing out cases where the principle of European citizenship is not being respected. Indeed, I think it is necessary to better promote the right of petition, the European Citizens’ Initiative and easy, user friendly and comprehensible access to documents and information. Efforts must also be undertaken with regard to double taxation, health care abroad and the respect of consumers’ rights, particularly online and for cross-border purchases. I also fully support the desire to establish physical and online one-stop shop systems, giving European citizens access to information at local, national and European level. I hope, finally, that the European Year of Citizens in 2013 will be an opportunity to strengthen this debate and bring about significant improvements so that all Europeans may enjoy their rights in the internal market.</p>

      <p sl="it">I welcome the EU citizenship report 2010 as it sets the objective of dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights. I also take the view that the proposals contained therein represent tangible measures for reducing needless expenditure and thus contributing to the purchasing power of EU citizens, which is particularly important during times of crisis. Finally, I hope that all Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies will ensure that the right of access to documents is guaranteed by improving transparency so as to enable citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making process.</p>

      <p sl="pl">I endorsed the report on the EU citizenship report 2010. Twenty years have passed since the introduction of EU citizenship. Amongst other things, we now enjoy problem-free crossing of borders and cheaper telephone calls, and we can study, work and live in another Member State. However, it is still the case that when EU citizens are in another Member State and want to exercise the rights to which they are entitled, they encounter difficulties which should be prevented. A large number of petitions have revealed problems in the field of accessing social security benefits.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Furthermore, over 48% of EU citizens do not think they are sufficiently well informed about their rights. In their efforts to strengthen EU citizenship, the EU institutions must concentrate on better, suitably financed communication with the citizens and the Member States at local and national level. It is vital to promote online one-stop shops such as Your Europe, and the information and problem-solving networks set up by the Commission, such as Europe Direct, Solvit and the European Consumer Centres. The new EU e-justice portal is also a valuable compendium of information about legal procedures and arrangements in each Member State.</p>
      <p sl="pl">The year 2013 has been declared the European Year of Citizens, and this is the right time to inform European citizens about the rights to which they are entitled, in particular, the new ones established by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. I would also like to call attention to promotion of the European Citizens’ Initiative, which will give citizens the possibility to become actively involved in the framing of European policies and legislation.</p>

      <p sl="pl">EU citizens often encounter obstacles in everyday life in the European Union. These include, for example, formalities related to health care or simply in connection with registering a car in another Member State. The European Union should help eliminate the problems associated with this. Furthermore, EU citizens often are not aware of the rights to which they are entitled when in another Member State, and also they often do not know the law as it applies to fundamental consumer protection rights. Therefore, they are not satisfied as consumers.</p>
      <p sl="pl">Current legislation on the protection of consumers’ rights should be adapted and, for example, a set of common rights for travellers should be guaranteed. In some Member States, EU law is incorrectly applied in relation to the right of free movement in the Union, and burdensome administrative procedures are created by some Member States in contravention of EU law. Other important obstacles which make it difficult to work in another Member State are related to the existence of different social security systems and the lack of sufficient cooperation between national social security institutions. In relation to this, EU legislation on free movement and the provision of information to the Union’s citizens should be strictly applied.</p>

      <p sl="it">One of the objectives of the European Union is dismantling the obstacles to citizens’ rights. In fact, according to the EU citizenship report 2010, EU citizens face many obstacles in different roles (as private individuals, consumers, residents, students, tourists and professionals or political actors) and puts forward solutions for overcoming them. A quarter of the obstacles relate to free movement and to residence. Citizens often have difficulties accessing social security entitlement, especially because the relevant legislation is often complex, difficult to understand and sometimes incorrectly applied by the relevant authorities. They frequently do not fill in the right forms or miss the deadlines for submitting the appropriate documentation because they have not been properly informed or they have not found the necessary instructions before leaving their home countries. Problems in the field of family law were revealed mainly with respect to child custody in case of divorce or recognition of partnerships registered in another Member State. This vote will try to eliminate the obstacles to EU citizens exercising their rights, thereby harmonising and creating continuity between the various national legal systems.</p>

      <p sl="pt">The objective of this report on European citizenship is to use legislative and non-legislative proposals to remove obstacles to European citizens enjoying their rights in the Member States as workers, students, tourists and, above all, European citizens with political rights. The 25 measures of this initiative are the result of compiling European citizens’ petitions that highlight, inter alia , freedom of movement violations, lack of awareness of their rights, double taxation, non-implementation of the Qualifications Directive, and a lack of information and cooperation from the authorities themselves regarding social, civil and political rights. Since 2013 will be dedicated to European citizenship, I think that this report introduces measures to ensure full implementation of European citizens’ rights, as well as highlighting the obstacles that they face.</p>

      <p sl="ro">I voted for the EU citizenship report 2010: Dismantling the obstacles to EU citizens’ rights. Parliament calls for the removal of barriers preventing the free movement of EU workers, and for guidance and advice for mobile workers on employment opportunities and on living and working conditions in the EU through EURES. We call for better coordination between Member States in dealing with problems such as double taxation or lack of harmonisation of pension taxation for EU citizens. In the health care sector, we call on the Commission and Member States to provide EU citizens with better information about their rights to cross-border medical care and to the means available for enforcing them, such as how to get costs reimbursed on the basis of the European health insurance card. We should point out that doctors, midwives and nurses, and citizens from Member States which have joined the EU since 2004, have encountered problems relating to the recognition of their qualifications or of their rights acquired in a Member State other than their own. We welcome the role played by information and problem-solving networks set up by the Commission (such as the ‘Your Europe’ website, Europe Direct, SOLVIT and the European Consumer Centres) in providing the public with information and settling complaints regarding malfunctions in the internal market or restrictions on EU citizens’ rights.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU citizenship report 2010 outlines concrete measures that the Commission is taking to ensure that EU citizens are able to exercise their rights to the full in EU Member States. It includes 25 of the most important obstacles that our citizens face while exercising their rights in their country of residence or across borders and puts forward solutions for overcoming them. More than 300 relevant petitions received were analysed. Issues related to free movement account for approximately 25% of the total number of petitions received. Freedom of movement is one of the fundamental rights of EU citizens recognised under the Treaties. The report also summarises that the greatest obstacles to exercising active Union citizenship are a lack of awareness by individuals of their rights as EU citizens and a lack of clearly structured, widely publicised information explaining their rights. For all these reasons, I will vote in favour of this report as it is our duty to improve this situation, which is crucial for our EU citizens.</p>

      <p sl="el">I voted in favour of Ms Vălean’s report because I consider it to be a very important report on the part of the Committee on Petitions. At a time when people are voicing doubts about the European institutions and the citizens of the European Union are showing a great deal of mistrust in its efficacy, we need a report that proves that the voice and concerns of European citizens are being heard. The EU needs to prove that freedom of movement is not a theoretical right and I am delighted that the report takes issue with certain cases of infringement (rights of family members in Britain, recognition of study diplomas in other countries and so forth) and calls for immediate action to address them.</p>

      <p sl="en">The EU citizenship report highlights the important ongoing citizens’ rights issues that must be addressed by the Commission. The free movement of EU citizens is a basic right but people with disabilities, minority groups and same-sex couples are among those who continue to face obstacles when exercising this right. These barriers must be eliminated, and by voting in favour of this resolution on citizens’ rights, I join other MEPs in calling for Member States to remove these legal and practical barriers. The resolution, which has my full support, also calls for the Commission to tackle problems facing citizens in regard to access to information, electoral rights and the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>

      <p sl="en">The report highlights EU citizens’ need for free movement, when we want to legally recognise the concept of Union citizenship. Right to petition, right to access to documents, right to an ease in movement of children with separated parents coming from different nations, and the real necessity for the ECI Regulation and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to be enforced are the main points of this report. The EU urges the Member States to find new solutions to eliminate any remaining administrative and legal obstacles in the single market. Our citizens need answers from the EU institutions and user friendly and comprehensible barrier-free technologies will help them to communicate with the EU administrative apparatus. For all these reasons, I voted in favour of this report.</p>

      <p sl="pt">This report deepens the European Union’s federalism, openly setting a series of aspects of national legislation against European legislation. It seeks to define and apply what is termed ‘European citizenship’, as if it made sense to regard the nationals of individual countries first and foremost as members of a ‘European nation’. This report also proposes a number of harmonisation measures, particularly in taxation and social security, and promotion of the digital single market, which confirms the report’s entire federalist outlook. Moreover, it advocates unacceptable interference in the internal workings of political parties by proposing that ‘membership of a European political party could be suggested more often when someone joins a national party’ and that ‘more direct participation by citizens through European political parties’ should be encouraged, based on the idea that all parties are like-minded and follow the same ideology It thus seeks to impose a single political and ideological way of thinking. Naturally, we voted against.</p>
